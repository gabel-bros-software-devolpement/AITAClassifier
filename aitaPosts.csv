AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard?,"I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all

UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now

HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?,"I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: 

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" 

I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. 

That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",Not the A-hole
Aita for wearing the “joke” bikini my friend got me?,"So it was my birthday couple months ago. Had a party. Got some gifts. My friend “Mandy” for me a “super cute bikini”. I liked it. Said thanks. She had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

Anyway. Went to the community pool with my roommate. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... I look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

Haha good joke Mandy. 

Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. 

We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew? So you just spent last 30’ flashing my bf on purpose?” I reply I’m just wearing my birthday gift from her.

AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible.

AITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?,"New to reddit, please bare with. 

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". 

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd ""threatened"" to do it before (I literally just said ""okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything"" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way.

AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?,"The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200B;

My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200B;

I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200B;

I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.

&#x200B;

Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200B;

It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200B;

I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit/Update kinda:

Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

AITA for punishing my son after he said something racist?,"About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. 

I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. 

That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs?,"I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. 

She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. 

Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ 

I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. 

Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize.

AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?,"I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

AITA for switching to regular milk to prove my lactose intolerant roommate keeps stealing from me?,"Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don’t split costs on is groceries. Everyone’s in charge of buying their own food and we don’t touch whatever doesn’t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up. 

This issue has been going on almost a year and I’m sick of it. 

One of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I’ve only drank once or twice. 

I confronted R about this lots of times and that’s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I’m crazy even though it’s so obvious. 

My other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it’s not him. It’s always after we get back home and R’s already left for work that I notice my food’s gone. My roommate’s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I’m guessing cause R doesn’t like what he buys.

The funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what’s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it.

Last week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he’s lactose intolerant. 

The nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with “So then you’re the one who’s been stealing?” 

He freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was “sometimes” drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn’t have done that if he’d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up.

My roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It’s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we’re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.  

I told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I’m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?,"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

AITA for jumping out of a bathroom window to avoid my mom’s attempt at forcing a reunion between me and my ex fiancé?,"Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fiancé Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. 


The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn’t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have “blamed” me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. 


I’ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I’ve explained that there’s no chance we will ever get back together. 


So tonight I go over to my mom’s place because she’s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I’m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it’s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. 


I’m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. 


My mom called a short while ago saying she’s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she’s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn’t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",Not the A-hole
AITA - Telling my parents to pay me back my college tuition if they want a relationship,"I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I’m the only girl and have 3 brothers. 

Because of their expectation I’d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I’m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn’t allowed to apply for college.

I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn’t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought “them” for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.

My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I’m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were “sorry if they caused me pain” but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn’t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn’t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.

I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?,"**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. 

He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. 

He told my family and they think i’m the asshole. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not telling my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he's expecting?,"My mother died when I was 16. My dad married another woman two years later.

My grandparents, my dad's parents, HATE my stepmother. I really don't like her either.

Even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.

My grandparents are quite wealthy. My father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. He has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.

I just found out on Saturday that I'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. My father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.

My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep  my word.

But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.

I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.

AITA for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?,"**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200B;

My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200B;

Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200B;

After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?

AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid?,"So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.

I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to ""Bob"" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.

Now after I moved out, she started complaining how ""She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!"" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.

Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: ""I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.""

I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.

My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.

So AITA here?

Edit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling cashier that wasn’t the girls credit card?,"
Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?,"I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. 

Currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?",Not the A-hole
AITA for saying my babysitting rates are $35 an hour?,"I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.

My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. 

Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.

I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything

Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.

I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.

So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. 

And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.

I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. 

Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.

I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.

My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.

AITA For Firing An Employee After His Parents Died?,"I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives.

His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

AITA for shouting at my ex in front of my daughters?,"I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.

A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). 

After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.

The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.

My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed ""fuck you"", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying ""Look what you did""

When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",Not the A-hole
AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wife’s underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.

She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didn’t realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.

So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.

Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).

Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!

Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.

"AITA for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?","I fucking hate wedding culture.

It's bullshit.

My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

We put our foot down and said:

>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

We are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

AITA for taking back the beer I bought for a party from which I was uninvited?,"This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women. 

On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card.

I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said ""thanks, I'll pick you up at seven!""

7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24. 

I got back in the car and said ""let's party,"" and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place.

She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said ""thanks!"" in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room.

Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?",Not the A-hole
AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she’s very sick? I low key hate her.,"I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. 

She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.

Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. 

Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. 

My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

"WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?","My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?

AITA for not waking up my girlfriend for her exam after I overheard her calling me a little bitch?,"My girlfriend has online summer courses and she had an exam for one of them this morning. 

I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets. 

She has joked that I’m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it’s ok so I didn’t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy. 

However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn’t hear. She was bragging that I’m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like ‘good, put him in his place’ and she was agreeing. 

She specifically said ‘yeah I’m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I’m up and he’ll probably have breakfast ready for me too’ 

I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn’t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too. 

When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I’m an asshole and I’ve cost her her exam and I’m a piece of shit for what I did.

EDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can’t have my phone, work with food) I wasn’t expecting this many replies so fast. 

I think we’re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a ‘bitch’ for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she’s not done with me. 

I’m just trying to get through today’s shift and then deal with stuff later. I’ll try and get back as I can.

AITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?,"This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.

I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.

But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.

I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.
It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.

Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.

I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc.

AITA For Barring My Husband From The Bedroom Tonight?,"So here is the situation.

Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. 

Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. 

Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. 

Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. 

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. 

As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). 

He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch.

AITA for telling my wife’s friend she is too old and ugly after she repeatedly asked my 19-year-old son to take off his shirt? He was getting uncomfortable.,"My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. 

When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like ""Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son."" 

This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. 

At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. 

I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. 

Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my stepdaughter to stop using period products in the bathroom she shares with my teenage sons?,"I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn’t present in her life, nor is my sons’ mother. All four children share a bathroom.

My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. 

My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.

A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she’d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. 

She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I’ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it’s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn’t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can’t be flushed and that it’s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. 

I later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she’s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep. 

This is a genuine issue to me and she didn’t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it.

AITA for making fun of a white girl for being poor because she was being racist?,"I’m Asian, more specifically one of the only Chinese people in my grade, which has been absolutely fun these days. 

So the girl in question, has been racially harassing me since the beginning of lockdown, when she dmed and said “did the bat taste good? thanks a lot you fucking freak”. I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn’t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn’t reacting. 

My school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I’m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, “Are you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?” 

Other people around me fucking laughed, and I’m sure I don’t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn’t going to go to bat for me. 

I don’t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I’m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, “I’d be less concerned with what I’m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you’re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can’t afford healthcare.” 

Other students nearby told me I went too far because “it wasn’t her fault she was poor” LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?!

She’s left me alone ever since though, which doesn’t matter since I plan on transferring anyways.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for ""making fun"" of a woman for being in her 40s and single?","This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. 

He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. 

Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. 

Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. 

Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol

Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband

Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important

Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. 

Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single

Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. 

AITA reddit?

Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.

Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying ""sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol."" 

He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said ""oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.""",Not the A-hole
AITA for leaving significant facial scarring uncovered on a plane and being confrontational when a father asked me to cover it because it was scaring his son?,"
I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender ""new skin"". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. 

In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.

But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as ""the girl with the scar"" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.

This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.

I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. 

It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.

So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.

I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... 

His father said to me, ""Can you cover that injury?"" 

I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. 

He started snapping at me saying ""there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.""

I said ""this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.""

He started to backtrack saying ""just until it's healed"" and I said ""it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. 

He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.

AITA For Not Baking Much For My Family,"I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I've given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.


Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.


I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I've spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts.",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking my cousin off of my sister’s wedding Zoom call?,"My [27M] older sister [30F] and her fiancé [31M] were planning for over a year for their wedding to be this month. Obviously, they can’t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a “Zoom” wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fiancé. 

My sister didn’t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. 

She and her fiancé decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fiancé and quote “overshadow” them on their big day “that was already scaled down”. However, her and her fiancé said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. 

Fast-forward to the day of the wedding—everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they’d like to talk so it doesn’t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he’s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He’s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like “(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it’s given me the courage to do this....” then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??

I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he’s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I’s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. 

The rest of the wedding went smoothly—except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??",Not the A-hole
"AITA for not wanting my son to literally be named ""John Doe?""","So my last name is Doe. It hasn't affected my life much apart from occasionally being called ""Dodo"" while growing up or friends spelling it ""D'Oh"" as a joke, and I'm generally pretty neutral about it.

My wife is six months pregnant and wants to name our future son after her grandfather, who died of cancer in September. His name was John. 

I liked her grandfather, and I know he and my wife were very close, but I won't even consider it, not even for our son's middle name. I feel that's just setting him up a world of problems, especially when he grows up and has to apply for jobs. Nobody's going to believe ""John Doe"" is his real name.

AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?,"Hi all. 

I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. 

My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

AITA for telling my wife it’s not ‘cute’ for her to encourage our teenage daughter to expect her boyfriend to pay for EVERYTHING in their relationship?,"Wife and I have been married 18 years, we have our 16 year old daughter who has been dating a slightly shy/ awkward young man for around 3-4 months now. 

He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can’t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she’s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.  

My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. 

Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. 

Some of the advice I’ve heard my wife give is ‘oh it’s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!’ Or ‘oh honey don’t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would’ and similar. 

I’ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away ‘two people in a partnership should be contributing equally’ and my personal favorite ‘if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it’s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it’s reasonable to split the payment’. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. 

However I’ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven’t been anywhere obviously since we’re home but the way she talks about him ‘oh I’ll just ask him to pay for x’ etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother’s advice, i.e. ‘if you really liked me you’d pay for x’ 

I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it’s a rite of passage for girls and it’s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it’s not cute for her to be thinking it’s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.",Not the A-hole
AITA for admitting I regret having children.,"My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). 

Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". 

I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. 

My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.

Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. 

It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. 
 
AITA for saying it though?

Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. 

When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. 

Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  

Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. 

My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.

Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.",Not the A-hole
AITA for suggesting/letting my 17 year old son get drunk?,"I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.

My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.

I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a ""test run"" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.

We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.

I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his ""first experience"" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.

AITA for telling this college guy's mom that her coming into his interview cost him the job?,"I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.

We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. 

A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.

She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.

I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. 

It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.

I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)

Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.

I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. 

However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.

I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves.

AITA For ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?,"I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

​

Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

As promised, I ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""

E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.

Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""

​

I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.

Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

AITA For kissing my friends brother without his consent during a truth or dare?,"Yesterday I was supposed to spend the night at my friends house with some of my classmates and we were playing truth or dare. There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges.

I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn’t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn’t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn’t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving.

AITA for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her African American boyfriend to her grandparents?,"Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

AITA for going to the police over a 'prank',"Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",Not the A-hole
AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",Not the A-hole
"AITA because I ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?","What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. 

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. 

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

Edit: I guess I’ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can’t find out why.

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn’t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",Asshole
AITA for I telling my childhood bully (who is MtF transgender) that she will always be the “boy who bullied me”?,"When I was a in middle school, I was viciously bullied by this boy, who I’ll call Z. He spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

It’s been 12 years, and Z has since come out as MtF transgender. She messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. We went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. It was along the lines of, “I’m sorry for being mean. I was young, and I was struggling with my gender identity.”

I thanked her for her apology. When she asked if she was forgiven, and I tried to avoid answering. I am still not over what she did to me. What Z did to me impacted me greatly, as I was a impressionable young girl. I struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

Z started getting defensive. She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, “Why? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won’t change that.” She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her. She called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

AITA for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that I cheated on her?,"I know the title sounds absolutely terrible. 
 
My ex and I were together for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a talk. She realized that she was gay, since ""I've been trying to hard to please myself from men"". We broke up.
 
The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it.

AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?,"My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed.

AITA for ruining game night by telling the truth?,"A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.

We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.

Cue a question I drew: ""What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?""

Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.

I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" 

Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.""

If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA? My mom is an influencer. I am sick of being a part of it, I had ""NO PHOTOS"" hoodies printed for me and my little sister.","I am a teenager and my mom is kinda famous on Instagram and blogging. She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. 

It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.

I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.

""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""

It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.

And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.

My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking

But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.

And I'm always like ""no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. 

I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.

I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.

Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a ""gangster hoody"". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree

AITA for wanting my daughter’s boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?,"I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting upset that my sister’s fiancé pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?,"The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

I’m 24 and I’m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

She’s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

She also met her fiancé two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He’s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. 

Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I “didn’t bring anything in”.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn’t I, and I tell him not to touch me. 

He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid. 

At this point I’m getting more and more angry and I’m practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just “drop it.” He said he would but that “they can deal with it when I get out of hand.”

I just went to go find a seat after that. 

After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should’ve let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had “something to hide.” 

I don’t think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don’t think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this.

I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11.

So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again.

AITA for saying my sister needs to stop bringing up her miscarriage for attention?,"Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. 

Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. 

So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. 

So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",Not the A-hole

My coworkers and office are very anti-young people and constantly rag on ""those millennials"" and their ""financial irresponsibility"". I'm one of 4 people under 30 in the office, and my coworkers are usually shocked by my age. 

They know I have no college debt because I mentioned it once, and I mentioned in passing that I had bought a condo. On the last happy hour zoom meeting, they started in on their talk. I tried to gently defend my generation only to have them say that I shouldn't because unlike them, I'm actually responsible, and I prove that millennial actually COULD do it if they really tried. 

Here's the thing. My aunt died when I was 8, and she basically left enough money and time for my parents to invest for a college fund. I have my condo because my grandmother died this year, I was on the lease, and I had enough to pay off the 20k left on the mortgage. Basically put, my ""success"" is, to be blunt, people dying at a convenient time.

"AITA for telling my husband that his culture is garbage and I won't ""compromise"" by incorporating it into our family life?","My husband and I live in the US northeast, where I am from. “John” moved here for work several years ago, from the deep south of the US where he grew up, raised with Christian holidays but never attending church. Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John’s parents AND his childhood best friend “Dan” and his wife decided to move here as well.

This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a “distanced picnic” at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to “jokingly” rip on him for being “whipped” and doing “my” job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be “allowed” to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how “mean” I was for not “fixing him a plate” and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families ""do it right"", where they handle the “outside chores” while their wives handle the “inside chores” (including the care of Dan and his wife’s two children). I think it’s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have “outdoor chores”, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.

The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to “go for a walk” and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for “making \[him\] look bad” in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how “a traditional division of labor” is “a huge part of southern culture”, and how I was being “disrespectful” to his background by “forcing northern culture” onto him and his family. He said he’s been building up a lot of “resentment” the past few months that I “make” him do half the chores and childcare, since in his “culture”, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.

I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how ""southern hospitality"" is reserved only for those in your in-group.

AITA for pressing charges against my son?,"My son (28) was visiting us for a couple days and was at my house alone babysitting my daughters kid.

According to my son, the other day my 4-year-old granddaughter (his niece) pulled down the TV and broke it. My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.

My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.

Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. 

I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?,"My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I’ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I’ve always been supportive of him and his identity. 

I’ve been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It’s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. 

After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn’t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it’s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his “step grandparents” in the future anyway. I still don’t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs?,"I have big boobs. I’m currently at 52kg and there’s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I’m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. 

My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She’s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I’m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. 

Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’. I know she’s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I’ve told her a few times to drop it before. 

Now we’re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again. I’m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?



**Edit:** I’m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah’s been telling everyone that it’s ME that’s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.


**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn’t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn’t).

I’ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I’ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I’m stupidly shy?)

My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don’t know how it’s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.


**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I’ve seen:

- I’ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.

- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.

- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.

- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.


**Update 2:**

The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. 

I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. 

I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.


**Last Update:**

I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. 

If I don’t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.",Not the A-hole
AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

I noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.",Not the A-hole
AITA for helping my friend get a girl removed from the soccer team?,"
I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. 

Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)

Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. 

I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior. 

Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I’m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it. But I think I did the right thing.",Not the A-hole
AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?,"I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not forgiving my(27) fiance(28) for missing the birth of our daughter?,"My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only ""friend"" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\*\*\*\* and a c\*\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\*\*\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.

AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog?,"I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. 

While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.

So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". 

Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my male friend that he’s shit at sex,"One of my (24F) male friends, I’ll call Jack (25M), is a bit of a lad and very good looking. Jack basically thinks that lad points are important, he’s always going on about how many girls he’s been with and how high is body count is. I lived with him in a house share for a while and whenever he bought a girl home, he’d make sure to parade her around by introducing her, spend 15-20mins in his room having sex, then come out and strut around naked or in his boxers..yes he really would. I remember saying a few times why are you out here, you have a beautiful girl in your room and you’re not in there with her?

This behaviour was pretty common for him and even though he was an almighty douche, we were still friends. Anyway after about 8 months of living together, after a drunken night, me and Jack ended up in bed together. Honestly it was terrible and having slept with him I realised something. Jack had a big dick (which I knew because of his strutting) but he thought that having a big dick automatically meant he was good at sex. Like it just immediately made him amazing in bed. Our sex was shit, like hands down the worst sex I’d ever had. No foreplay, he left lights and tv on, then unceremoniously shoved himself inside me. The whole thing was basically a race for him to get inside me as quickly as possible. Maybe 10 minutes of uncomfortable jackhammering then he was done. The next morning I was really sore because 1. I wasn’t wet at all 2. His dick was big. But because I was sore he took that as him doing a bang up job. Anyway that experience was a few years ago, and even after all this time, Jack is still the same lad he was and still fucks girls like they’re lined up on a conveyor belt for him. 

Back to the present. Recently, my husband and I hosted a bbq in our garden as gatherings are now allowed. Jack came over as he’s in our mutuals group. Of course after a while Jack starts going on about the girls he’s fucked, and even showing up another girl at the party by telling people he’d fucked her. It’s then he turns to me and asks if I can prove to the lads how “fire” he is at sex. Slightly embarrassed but also angry he even mentioned me, I straight up told him he was shit. Basically worst sex I ever had, I then went onto say what happened and that he only has sex just to say that he’s had sex. It wasn’t fun, pleasurable or enjoyable and for the record I didn’t come. Amazingly enough, two other girls also backed up what I was saying. Saying their nights with him were pretty much the same to how I described it. Jack got defensive and angry but we wouldn’t drop it. He eventually left absolutely fuming. 

My husband, who knows I slept with him years before said I was insensitive, especially as it seems jack relies heavily on the lad/sex God persona he’s created. I don’t think so, it was about time Jack was called out for being shit in bed and maybe use this to learn how to actually have sex.  All the boys in the group think I’m an ass for calling Jack out, me and the girls disagree.



EDIT: - Holy cow this got way more attention than I thought it would! Thanks for all the comments.l and thank you kind strangers for the awards!!

Should clear a few things up. A lot of people asking why I was or am friends with Jack. I was back then, because honestly at times he was a decent guy, just blanketed by a douchey exterior. After I moved out of the house, we fell out of close contact but are still hovering in mutual friend circles. I’m not directly friends with him now but he’s still a friend of a friend and we are normally civil.

EDIT #2: I really don’t get why people are misunderstanding the story. For the record I did not cheat on my husband. Jack and I had a one night stand together years ago while we were at uni. I wouldn’t consider him my friend now but we still have mutuals from different social circles and we do occasionally still see one another.

INFO: Basically my friend group (close/mutual/extended) all knew or knew of each other at uni. I’m British and now live in the states. I attended Uni between the ages of 18 - 21. At 19 I went to the states for a year abroad, and the sister Uni is where I met my now husband. Jack is American and was an international student doing exchange, I was first year he was second year. I, a first year, ended up living with Jack because I decided to go to uni last minute, and as Halls were full, ended up responding to a house share ad (a lot of students drop out after making a house share commitment so these ads are common)

I actually met my husband (also American) through Jack, as Jack was one of my only known contacts when I moved to the states. (My British uni and his American uni were linked) I met my husband a year AFTER I slept with Jack. I could not possibly have had any idea that my housemate and one night stand would go on to introduce me to my future husband. My husband knew Jack and I slept together because unfunnily enough, Jack brought it upon our first meeting.

Living together, Jack and I mainly bonded over weed and raves, and although he was sometimes somewhat decent, looking back I’m disgusted at our so called friendship. I could write an essay on how he treated me.

AITA for refusing to RSVP to my sister’s wedding because I’m required to write an “application essay” just to attend?,"Yeah I know this sounds insane but I’m living in it. 

So my sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less. I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.

Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they’re cutting capacity by half. As a result she’s sending out “re-invites” that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she’s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word “essays” to two questions. The gist is that they’ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people’s enthusiasm. People who don’t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.

I just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren’t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like ”why do you still want to celebrate this day with us?” And “what will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?” So she’s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. 

Anyways I told her in advance I’m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She’s said that to keep things fair if I don’t fill out the RSVP correctly I won’t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don’t show up I’m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays. 

AITA if I stay stubborn on this? I’m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA?

Edit: I’m 27F. I don’t live with family but she is my only sister.

Edit2: Sister has framed these essays as “surveys” but there’s a word limit requirement so if you don’t reach it on the google forms you can’t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my autistic brother the truth when he asked me why women don’t like him?,"I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. 

Recently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. 

I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. 

So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. 

Anyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. 

Now I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

AITA for laughing uncontrollably at my son when he asked me to replace a Christmas gift he broke out of anger?,"I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about. 

My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. 

I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.

After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.

However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he ""really liked it"" and ""it would only be fair"", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was ""fair"" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.

This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say ""but I need a chair!"" or ""What am I supposed to do now"" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.

He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.,"I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. 

I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said ""Einstein"" once and John interrupted him to say, ""I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?"". I once put up a snapchat story saying, ""I love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""It's called gridiron you moron"".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went ""I'm a Biomed Engineer"". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing"". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, ""damn M0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like ""His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo"". To which he got angry again and said, ""I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you"". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, ""Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*"" 

His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",Not the A-hole
AITA for suing my ex?,"So I dated a YouTuber.

We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority.

Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up.

Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive.

I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.

So I sued my ex.

It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.

They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.

After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.

Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......

But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.

Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.

A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.

Was I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for throwing out my mom after she threw out my weed?,"Throwaway in case someone I know sees this, don't want them to know my main reddit account.

So I am a 30 year old man. I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.

I have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.

At first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still  a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect. 

The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment. 

Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.  So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.

Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away. 

She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for disowning my brother when he came out as gay, because of how he's treating his wife?","I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. 

My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. 

Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.

I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for banning my husband’s female friend from our house?,"Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I’m on mobile - I apologise. 


I (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) ‘Mary’. They’ve known each other since they were in high school and she’s considered ‘one of the boys’, if you may. That basically means she’s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don’t mind at all, I trust my husband. 


Well, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I’m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn’t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband’s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me ‘are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?’ to ‘are you a gypsy? I bet you’ve got some of that gypsy blood in you’ (which is just blatantly racist)


Last week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she’s been understanding so it’s unlikely she’ll say something this time.


It was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary’s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I’m a witch and I’m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I’m just a ‘immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband’s life’ and I’ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn’t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. 

AITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I’m way too sensitive about my heritage and I’m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I’m still not ok with her.


EDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I’m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We’ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I’ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.


EDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: 



A lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband’s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn’t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they’ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I’m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she’s focusing on her career, she’s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. 




But now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I’m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won’t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy me pads?,"Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account. 

I (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven’t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well. 

Anyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn’t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would’ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn’t really expecting that. 

I asked him why. He said that he didn’t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn’t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn’t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn’t want anyone to see him with the pads because they’d think he was a “tr***y”. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn’t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I’ve been thinking that maybe I might’ve pushed it too far.

So AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?

*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I’m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we’ll see how it goes*

**UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn’t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn’t feel like he had to, and that I could’ve “held it in” and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can’t “hold in” menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could’ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn’t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. 

I asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he’d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn’t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I’d need help is if I was a “cripple”. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn’t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. 

I can’t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can’t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month’s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I’m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I’m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?,"I’m 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

I was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

I managed to get with a beautiful girl named Marcy when I first started getting into the thick of things. She knew who I was but she said she loved me. 

I will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

A year ago she reached out to me on Facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn’t hate me for what happened and she hoped I was still clean. 

Last week I got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on Facebook that Marcy had OD’d and there was a funeral service this upcoming Thursday.

I immediately just burst into tears because I hoped that this would never happen and I feel so much guilt over it. 

I want to go to the funeral service for her but I’m afraid that my presence would be unwanted. At the most I would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. I need to do this for myself.

AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

AITA for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?,"About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...

We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. 

Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting mad at my sister for not wanting me shirtless at her pool?,"My sister and her husband invited me over to their pool today for a little BBQ. I assumed it would just be me, my sister, her husband, my nephews, and my parents. But turns out they also invited her husband’s side of the family. 

When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I’m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they’re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You’d have to look really close to even notice. 

I’ve been to their pool many times and she’s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. 

When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I’m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn’t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. 

She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. 

When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn’t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn’t expect her to ask me this. 

My mood was soured after that and I didn’t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. 

I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. 

My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she’s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn’t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.

What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn’t mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?",Not the A-hole
AITA for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /Petty,"OK so this is kinda complex, I'll make it short.  This acc is just for privacy reasons

-I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this. 

-I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23

-Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J. 

-Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. 

-Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",Not the A-hole
"AITA for refusing to use the money I inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? She is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.","When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.

My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""She is your sister"" and ""If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

AITA for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?,"I have waited tables for the last three years.

During my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.

About five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. 

A few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

It was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.

Several minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

I stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

But when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to visit my dad after my room was converted to an office/bedroom?,"I used to visit my dad most weekends and all of summer.

He recently got remarried to someone I actually have a decent relationship with. I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with.

My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom.

When I went to visit last month, I was ""surprised"" with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose.

Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office.

I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since.

I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide.

My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore.

Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.

AITA for correcting my daughter’s teacher about her name?,"My 7 year old daughter’s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter’s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. 

A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter’s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. 

So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher’s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn’t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. 

I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. 

I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.

She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was “Keeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly” and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.

So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there’s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said “Hi, this is *Keeley’s* Dad. Her’s name not Kelly. It’s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.” 

A few hours later I had an email in my inbox “inviting” my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. 

The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should’ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were “similar enough” for it to “not have warranted such drastic action.”

That surprised me. I couldn’t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. 

I can’t tell if I’m being that annoying “my kid matters most” parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that’s a basic part of her job. AITA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?,"I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",Not the A-hole
AITA for grounding my daughter because she called my SIL a “slut”?,"My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200B;

My husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL’s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200B;

My SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as “a vapid slut” and her husband “a pathetic cuck” along with other slurs I don’t want to repeat.

&#x200B;

I grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that’s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister’s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I’m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We’re definitely concerned for our daughter about what’s happening at school and we’re looking into therapy.

For clarification, as for my SIL’s privacy, she didn’t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",Asshole
"AITA for telling my father ""we'll catch the next one"" when he invited me to his wedding?","He's been married 4 times now, and this wedding will be his fifth in the span of 30 years. I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.

Dad told me to bring my ""partner"" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.

I notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say ""*we* will check if *we're* free"".

Dad replies that ""this is family only""

I reply, ""I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones""

Dad says ""that's different. Are you coming?""

I say ""we'll catch the next one"".

Dad's fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.

I felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.

AITA?

Info: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight, dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend's biology. Of me and my siblings, 3 were within wedlock and the other 4 (including me) were extramarital: 3 affairs, 1 long term girlfriend. The fiancee knows she's #5 and dad gives the same story about how he was tricked into marrying golddiggers by accident and didn't know until too late and the affairs all happened as the relationships were breaking down.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my date for their ID to confirm their age?,"I (22 F) Went on a coffee date with this guy from tinder after talking for about a week. On the app it said that he was also 21. 

When I got to the coffee place he looked kinda like his pictures but a little younger making me question his age. So, I decided to ask him if he wanted to get a drink later. He started acting kinda weird and looked nervous before suggesting dinner instead. This was odd to me bc he had previously said that he enjoyed drinking. 

During the date he also said he worked somewhere else then he had told me via text making the whole interaction seem ""off"". At the end of the date I asked him to drive me home and when we were in front of my apartment I brought up the inconsistencies between what he texted me vs what he said and asked to see his ID. He started crying and apologizing and showed me his ID. He was 18. I felt really bad for making him cry esp bc I didn't plan on going on a second date.

AITA for telling a woman who lives in my complex that yes having her husband check me out turns me on?,"Okay, hear me out. I live in a complex that is built in a circle so its like a track.

I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.

This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.

So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, ""Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?"" To which I replied, ""Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high."" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm.

AITA for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?,"My younger sister and I were very close when young but no so much now. I was born in fairly well to do Hindu family. I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.

Recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

My sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.

It all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

I asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
I suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

I explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

She told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
At this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


Later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'.

AITA for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.,"I’m(22M) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. We’re very close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. 

So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn’t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it’s extremely concerning that he’s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn’t hurt her, she was following me, I didn’t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn’t answer.

"AITA: I, a female, want to give my fiance my last name, but my father and brother don't want me to. Am I wrong for planning on doing it anyways?","To start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it. 

I brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones ""supposed"" to carry on our name.

I think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?

*UPDATE* 

Did not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands—I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I’ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :) 

As for my fiancé— he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He’s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao.

AITA for not sharing medical history before being pranked?,"Heyo,
I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.

Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.

I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. 

I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.

AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?

Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.

Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.

Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia 

For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. 

You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say ""Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard"". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. 

Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again.

AITA for bringing my garden with me when I moved?,"I F(25) have been renting a house since I was 18 (7 years). When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space. 

Over the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. 

A few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help. 

My former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they’d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They’re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard.

Legally I’m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back. 

I’ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn’t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don’t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn’t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn’t plan to landscape before lockdown hit.

"AITA for ""tricking"" my copycat sister to cut her hair?","I have a younger sister who looks exactly like me. I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even. 


She also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other.


Honestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up??


I have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have.


One afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram. 


I received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style.


I went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair. 


She was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way.


Our parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I send my parents to jail?,"My (29f) parents have always been in financial trouble, something that I have never been able to understand because they both have a really generous salary (more than three times my own). Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.

All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .

In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.

Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.

So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.

My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.

My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.

So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?

"AITA for ""mansplaining"" vaginas to a woman?","This happened a few months ago, but my brain won't let this one go.

So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said ""Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become."" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.

Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking ""how me and my dick knows about that"". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole ""women get looser"" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: ""Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining.""

AITA for telling relatives how much I make and defending my salary?,"Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad’s relatives who I don’t see very often. 

My dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven’t either. He’s rude, condescending, and we don’t agree with him on a lot of things. 

Normally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job. 

I started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I’m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I’ve always wanted. 

Uncle asked “How much are they paying you anyway?” in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make. 

I guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like “Oh, enough” but I told him the number. 

He started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much. 

I got pissed and said “I deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can’t do what I do.” 

Well, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle’s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn’t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite. 

AITA?

EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he’s a retired airline pilot, so I don’t think he’s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he’s just a jerk.",Not the A-hole
"AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don’t want to do that.","My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That’s fine with me.

His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don’t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex’s cash cow and that’s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won’t even describe her as nice to me.

When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

I don’t want to do that. I don’t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don’t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift’s cost but I don’t want to share my and my husband’s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

I don’t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we’ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don’t understand what’s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

I know that many people will say that it’s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I’m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I’m not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",Not the A-hole
AITA for replying to a rude customer in the language they were speaking in front of me?,"I'm a slave to the siren (a Starbucks barista). I'm pretty decent with most customers and I'm pretty good at having convos with customers and sensing when someone just wants the line moved forward.

Anyway, I was on register the other day, taking people's orders. Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said ""a coffee, black"", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely

""Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, hè? Ze zouden en beetje kunnen leeren om hun hersenen te gebruiken""

Which is Dutch and translates roughly to 

""Wow, (this is) not the smartest gal that works here, huh? They could learn to use their brains a little""

Then he told me he wanted a medium dark roast. So I nodded and then replied to him in Dutch, asking him the regular questions I would to complete an order (anything else to eat or drink today?, What was your name for your other drinks? Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?). I was perfectly pleasant and smiley for the rest of the transaction but just conducted it in Dutch. 

He answered the questions in English but his eyes were bulging out of his head. His friend looked kind of worried but burst out laughing when they walked away.

I realize it might not be the best look for someone in service, and when my coworker asked me what it was about and I explained, she seemed kinda confused as to why I would do that.

I don't think it was an asshole move because I was still nice to the guy but I definitely called him out and made it clear to him that I'd understood the stuff he was saying. But maybe I shouldn't have because of the position I was in at the time (like customer service?)

AITA for not giving my brother and his wife any privacy?,"My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.

For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.

It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.

This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.

I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. 

I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.

AITA for not telling my parents how to read my diary?,"I am 15f and I have diary, and to prevent my older sister from reading it I created a new alphabet and to make it even harder to decode its not just the Latin alphabet that looks differently, i made some sounds like Yu, Ya, Sh, etc as one letter, like they are in Cyrillic. (Alphabet Russian, Bulgarian, Kazakh etc use)

Well my parents were snooping in my room and found my diary, and are demanding i tell them how to decode it so they can read it. They are saying that i need to share this with them and i can't have secrets from them and im under their roof. I eventually got sick of it and told them to fuck off. They sent me to my room and I'm here. They keep trying to decode my diary which I doubt they will but fuck this sucks.

AITA for telling my sister I don't trust her to watch my son?,"I'm a 19 year old man with a 3mo old son. His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.

The other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.

I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?

ETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off!

AITA for punishing my sons and not the woman?,"I’m going to try to keep this short since frankly - I’m exhausted. Any questions can and will be answered in the comments. 

Long story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can’t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.

Across from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven’t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they’re doing, and that’s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady’s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. 

I. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she’s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she’s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It’s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them, but not saying anything to the neighbor?

AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. 

Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my parents I won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?,"I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.

I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.

Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open

My friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

My bf is broke at the moment so I offered to go halves with the ticket. He didn't want to because then the car wouldn't be his completely. I wasn't too worried about it and didn't mention it again. I did however buy a ticket for myself.

Well, I won and as of August 1st will be the owner of the car. When my boyfriend found out he was really excited until I told him that I was going to sell it and put half of it in my savings and invest half of it. he said I can't sell OUR car without consulting him. I told him it's MY car and I can do whatever I want. 

He now claims it was all a big misunderstanding and apparently he wanted to go halves but hasn't got around to giving me the money yet. I call bs on it but he keeps saying that we're a couple and we should make decisions together.

My wife (29f) and I (27m) do well financially, so we decided to have our fourth child. Every single pregnancy we've been through my wife has been a complete nightmare. Some things I can deal with, like waking up to the sound of her puking her guts out every morning, but when she starts demanding I go to the store every day to get her snacks or set up her foot bath thingy because her feet are swollen, I get a little impatient. I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I'm a plumber, she's an engineer) so I think we're putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. 

And it's not like I don't help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly). My MIL comes over to help with the kids because she says I'm useless (ive been meaning to make a justnomil post about her), and while I appreciate the help I'm sick of her crap. Just because I want one hour of video games to myself a day instead of cleaning up messes in the kitchen doesn't mean I'm ""useless"". 

This all came to head yesterday when my wife screamed at me from the kitchen to get off my ass and entertain our twins so she could focus on her meatloaf. I made a dumb joke about how this is the third meatloaf we'll be eating this week, and she. lost. her. shit. She told me how I have no sympathy for the fact that she's pregnant, I should be taking on more of her chores since I can't breastfeed, but then I reminded her that I still work a lot more hours than her, so I think we're basically both pregnant.

She got really quiet, and has only spoken to me regarding the kids since. I don't think I'm wrong but I'll apologize to her if it makes her happy. AITA here?

Edit: my wife does get breaks, guys. I set up the annoying foot bath thing every night while she does dishes and then she relaxes with it while watching YouTube every night while I put the kids to bed. She also won't eat my cooking because she grew up in southeast Asia and doesn't like American food. It's not my fault she's picky.

WIBTA for running away on our honeymoon?,"(not from my husband)

My husband and I are on our honeymoon. His parents gifted us a week in an all inclusive hotel at no cost to us as a wedding gift, and we were really grateful. On arriving we found out that they'd also booked a room at this hotel for themselves for the whole week and want to do group things. Outside of this, we see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year for a couple days at a time as he finds them a bit overbearing at times and they don't really like me.

It's not like they're in the room next door or anything and we can still do stuff in our room alone but they knock on our door regularly, waking us up at 6am, making us get all 3 meals a day with them. We've tried telling them we wanted ""alone time"" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. We also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. My husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.

We've been talking and we saved up to pay for our own honeymoon before they surprised us. We still have the money we would have spent in our joint wedding/honeymoon account. There's another town we wanted to go to on our honeymoon and we looked it up and we could get tickets from here to there and then back home for less than £60 total. We could also book a few days in a nice hotel for about half of what's left in our wedding/honeymoon fund and use the remainder of the week we booked off in another town without his parents knowing we'd left until we had.

It's 9pm now, there's trains from here to the other town every hour, plus more half-hourly trains tomorrow.

Would we be the arseholes if we ran away from his parents without telling them?

Update: our train should be arriving in our final station in the next 30 mins, we've found a hotel that's able to take us tonight, and we are very excited about the next 4 days",Not the A-hole
"AITA for getting my family to do a ""swear tax"" after my dad told me off for swearing? (My dad and brothers cuss like sailors but apparently me cussing is unladylike?)","I am living with my family, it's me a 15 year old girl, my twin brothers who are 17, and my parents.

My dad cusses a lot, and so do my older brothers. But apparently the standards are different for me, my dad overheard me saying a couple cuss words when I was on the phone with my friends and he got mad at me for my language, and for how trashy and unladylike it was.

This wasn't the first time he called me (and only me) out for bad language, but it was the one that frustrated me the most because I could tell there was a double standard.

I thought of calling him out on his language and hipocracy, but then I had a different idea.

---

I said that yeah, it was a bad habit I was forming and didn't want to make a pattern... because if I got in the habit of cussing a lot, that wouldn't make me come off well when I start getting jobs or going to college. And as I was growing up, I wanted to learn how to speak respectfully and intelligently.

But it was hard to keep from bad habits, when I heard him and my brothers having potty-mouth-syndrome so often. They're setting an example whether they realize it or not... So I wanted to work on things for myself, but also together as a family. 

I suggested we make a ""Swear Tax"" where if anyone swears in front of anyone else who's participating, they give a dollar to each person who heard them. I'd want that rule for myself because it would keep me accountable and I'd really like it if the family joined me for it...

----

So my dad said he'd join, and so would my mom. They got my brothers to be a part of it too. They didn't really have a choice, my parents decided to make it a rule.

I know it's kinda petty but I wanted to make the point that my dad and brothers swear a lot and I almost never do. 

In the few months we've had the rule, I've gotten about 250 dollars from hearing my dad and brothers cuss, and have not sworn once. It's kinda making my brothers angry because they often cuss when they're mad, and I ask them for money, so they get madder and cuss more, so I get more money until they shut up.

My dad actually got mad at me too, he was having some drinks, calling his brother and talking, and I came over after and asked for 18 dollars. He actually said he wouldn't give me that much, and there should be a cutoff. He gave me 5 dollars which sends a weird message... Like swearing is bad, unless you wanna swear A LOT, then it's cool??

I feel like I've made my point already so really now I'm just continuing to ""want the family to learn not to cuss"" for the money, and it's really making my brothers mad.

AITA for having the idea for the ""family swear tax"" after my dad got angry at me for swearing? I did it because I know I swear the least out of my family but I was the only one getting in trouble for it",Not the A-hole
AITA? My parents took most of my wardrobe away as punishment and I said I didn't want the clothes back because it's obvious they're not actually mine.,"I got in trouble at school this fall, I'm a junior in high school. 

(Edit to add what I got in trouble for since a couple people asked... I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)

As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.

Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.

It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.

I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.

I don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms; I'll buy my own stuff.

So I told my parents that I don't care if they keep the clothes and makeup; they've made it clear that stuff doesn't belong to me. And it's gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren't mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I'd feel gross and I'd rather not wear them again.

So now my parents are mad because they've got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them; my mom isn't my size and my only sibling is my little brother.

I said I don't care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren't it. 

AITA for not taking the clothes back and letting them go to waste?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for insisting if I can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?","Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. 

About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. 

So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?

ETA: some questions people keep asking: 
1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and ""just do"". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. 
2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",Not the A-hole
AITA for cutting up and altering my wedding dress into a functional dress instead of giving it to my sister who can't afford an expensive dress?,"I need an unbiased opinion on this because I don't know if i was the asshole.

Throwaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.

So I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.

I had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to ""take my power back"" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.

The problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of "" you can change the worst memories"" or some shit like that.

My sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of ""oh well if you are not using it i will"". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.

Now my sister is mad at me and my mom says she understands our povs. But that I could have waited 5 more moths till after her wedding to ""take my power back""

AITA?

Edit : yes he fucked the stripper please stop asking me

Edit2: what the fuck is wrong with some of you. Suddenly I am the asshole for leaving my ex for cheating on me because it doesn't count because it was his bachelor party? Do you know how relationships work. Are you also going to tell me that if he cheated on a Saturday it wouldn't count? Or if he left the country?

AITA for proving to my roommate that her boyfriend keeps hitting on me?,"I’m Sam, my roommates name is Lauren, and her boyfriends name is Mark. 

Lauren and Mark have been dating for maybe four months. Mark always hits on me. Like always. As soon as Lauren walks away, Mark is laying it on thick with compliments, and asking when our lease is up. 

I wear a lot of body-con and sometimes low cut clothing , so I expect to get glances maybe mild staring. But this guy is very obviously hitting on me, and often times in ways that make me uncomfortable, especially since he is always at our apartment. 
 
I have told Lauren several times that Mark hits on me, and she just rolls her eyes. She doesn’t believe me, which is confusing to me. Lauren and I have been roommates for five years. In that time she has dated three other guys, and I have never complained about this before. 

So yesterday she tells me that Mark is coming over. I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me. She actually agreed to do it to “humor” me. 

Mark gets to the apartment, and I am just doing the dishes, I tell him that Lauren went to the store up the block, but she is really right outside the door. 

He sits at the counter and starts chatting with me normally, then the conversation turns to him hitting on me. Normally I just walk away from Mark, but I endured it so that Lauren would see/hear.

She came in and told Mark to go to her room. Then she then she starts yelling at *ME*. Saying I saying I tried to seduce him and that I dressed like a slut. And I’m like “I *always* dress like a slut Lauren! Who cares! Your boyfriend is hitting on me!”
We argued and both said some shitty stuff to each other. 

She and Mark are staying in her bedroom and we haven’t spoken to each other since. As I’m thinking about it, I’m wondering if I am an asshole for even trying to do this but at the same time I think she sucks for not believing me in the first place. 

I live in New York. I love my neighborhood I don’t want to have to find a new roommate because of this idiot. If I did an asshole thing please tell me. AITA",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my dad to “walk” me down the aisle because he’s in a wheelchair?,"About three years ago my dad was injured in a really bad hit and run car accident. He broke just about every bone in his body, and left him paralysed from the waist down. Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable. 

In November I’m getting married. I’ve been with my fiancé for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don’t want to be reminded of what could’ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we’re incredibly close. 

She naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn’t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA?

Update - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn’t okay. I’m going to call my dad tomorrow

Update 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you’re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you’re just as bad as I apparently am if you’re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet

UPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I’d give you all an update. My boyfriend and I have decided to part ways and ive apologised to my dad",Asshole
AITA for giving my wife an ultimatum about getting a dog?,"I had a dog when my wife and I got married. I loved her, she was my buddy. When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an ""aggressive breed"", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.

It's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being ""dangerous"".

I'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time.",Not the A-hole
AITA For Offering A Drink To A Girl In A Bar And Then Not Paying For It?,"I'm m23 and few months ago I was at a nice bar in Toronto with my boys and I saw this really hot girl.

She promptly says can I get 4 double shots of 1942. Thats like $75 a shot for a double of 1942 and I was like wtf and she said there for her friends and patted me on the back. When the bartender came back I slapped a $10 bill on the table and told him she'd be covering the shots and walked away. She was pissed and yelling the normal insults lol. 

Well it turns out my mom works with her and they were talking and my mom showed her a picture of me (god damn it mom!) and she instantly recognized me and remembered my name and told my mom about what I did. My mom then called me and said I'm a huge asshole and told me to send her the cost of the 4 drinks which was like $325 with tips.

WIBTA if I told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?,"So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out. 

As stated before I hate cheaters and I’ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don’t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?

TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she’s a close friend. WIBTA?

Edit: I’m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.

AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I’m no longer his Father?,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” 

He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).

My family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for telling my ""nephew"" his ps4 was going to be destroyed to teach him a lesson?","Ok. I fucked up.

My brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.

I told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.

Last week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.

My nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?

My nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.

He had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.

I spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.

Now, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.

And I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.

&#x200B;

Edit.

I tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.

1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.
2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.
3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.
4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.
5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.
6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.
7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.

In retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy. When you see it every day it is hard to notice that some behavior could be toxic. I don't regret what I did, and definitely don't regret posting it here. Reddit can be really insightful sometimes.

AITA for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?,"Not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

I met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

Our waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

At the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

The only one not happy was my date. She said, ""If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

So pardon my french, but what the fuck?",Asshole
AITA for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?,"On my gf's birthday I gave her a necklace that I spent $400 on.  I wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but I was expecting something.

Here's how it went down.  After dinner she asked me if I was ready for my gift, I said yes and she started giving me oral.  She doesn't like giving oral and I'm ok with it.  She was giving bad oral and honestly I just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.

I feel disappointed.   I don't think sex is a gift.  I didn't expect a gift that was equal to what I spent, but I wanted a least something.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 Ford Bronco I owned as a teenager?","So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. 

When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. 

Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! 

I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. 

My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?

Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she’s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She’s always been awesome to me and she’s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the “mommy bailed you out” comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it’s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it’s not like I’m not paying for it on my own eventually.

Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?

Edit4: I’m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I’m still reading because honestly I’m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you’re a mod, do you know? I can’t respond to any posts and get the “status 403” whenever I try. Thanks!

Edit in the morning: I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many private’s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn’t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I’ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I “had come to your senses” I don’t want to disappoint her. It’s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",Asshole
"AITA for being upset because my son didn’t talk to me, but talked to my wife.","I’m 40M, my wife is 39F, son in 15.

I went upstairs and knocked on his door, he said he’d come downstairs in few minutes. After 15 minutes he still didn’t come downstairs so I walked in his room. I knocked first. He was obviously crying. I asked him what was wrong but he didn’t answer me so I didn’t push him more. 

 I went downstairs and told my wife about it. She went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. She came back and brought him food upstairs. When I asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn’t anything important and told me to drop it. I got kind of upset because I want to know what was wrong and I’m his parent as well.

AITA for naming my child the same name that SIL named hers just weeks earlier?,"My SIL has never liked me. She had always tried to one up me. We were both pregnant at the same time. Her due date was 6 days after mine but her girl came early so she gave birth roughly 2 weeks before me. We had already announced our name because MIL wanted to make a blanket with baby's name in it.

SIL said their name was a secret. Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.

Well, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name. I told her tough luck and why did she think we'd change our name?",Not the A-hole
AITA for turning the home I inherited into an Airbnb? My sister thought it would be a “family home” forever.," I will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let’s say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. M

I got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I’ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I’ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there’s not someone renting full-time.

 My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she’s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she’s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it’s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She’s my older sister and I’ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being honest with my nephew about where I was for most of his life?,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid.

WIBTA If I posted a video montage online of my neighbor throwing things in my yard?,"My mom and I bought a duplex for me to manage and live in during my years in college. Bought the house in 2018, I moved in the summer of 2019. We installed a ring video security system, along with a front yard doorbell and backyard video floodlights.

When I moved in, there were a ton of branches and limbs by my neighbors fence. That was odd since we only had one medium-sized tree, nearly ten feet from the fence.

Later that summer, the backyard ring camera caught the neighbor throwing branches over. We realized that that is where the huge pile came from.

Halloween came around and my roommate and I decided to throw a party on Friday, November 1st. We tried to talk to Ms. Stick thrower, but they were not home during our three attempts. We left a note explaining it, along with our names and numbers.

The party was 30+ people coming and going, along with music and a beerpong table in the backyard. Cops were (rightfully) called at 11:45PM; we shut it down.

The 4th, I was in class and got a front doorbell notification. It was Ms. Stick thrower pulling up my decorative styrofoam tombstones and throwing them behind my bushes. When I got home I saw that one was broken. 

My roommate and I decided to call the non-emergency line about this, because obviously she had no respect for us, and this is the south so anyone could have a gun.

A cop came out, we showed her everything, and we went to talk to the neighbor. Her fiancee opened the door, claimed she was not home despite her car being there.

Anyways, time went on and I noticed that she came into our backyard via a gate, which was deep in my backyard. This freaked me out, as video showed her smoking and wandering around my backyard. I put a carabiner on the gate to keep her out.

End of November, I come home and see these huge limbs flying over the fence. I get out, confront her, we argue, and she claims that she owns two feet of my backyard. She ends the conversation with ""Do you want to make these next four years a living hell?"" 

Called the non-emergency number, and once again she hid from the cops. I found out that she is a professor at my university. 

I emailed the dean of students, told him everything and provided proof. Their resources were useless, and I am beyond fed up. Cops say they can't do anything, despite video evidence and four no trespassing signs. I want her to stop.

We got a survey done, and she does NOT own two feet into my backyard.

I have edited together a video montage of her throwing limbs, branches, sticks, rocks, and cigarettes together, along with her trespassing in my backyard.

WIBTA if I posted this video online with the caption ""University Professor's Actions""?

Edit: I have spoken to my mom and we just sent an email, entailing all the details plus video, to her Dean. Also, I posted to legal advice.

Edit: Wow, okay, really did not expect this to get so much traction. I appreciate everyone's advice, and I plan on making many calls tomorrow. The Dean's office reopens tomorrow as well, so I might hear back from them then. Not sure whats going on with my legal post, I'll try to fix it. There is also NO TREES/BRANCHES HANGING OVER THE FENCE. She is throwing branches from her yard into mine. In the beginning, I threw the branches back over, but they would magically appear with even more. So I gave up.

WIBTA if I refused to attend my cousins wedding after she asked me to dye my ginger hair?,"Yes I'm aware that my cousin posted here and oh the irony as i showed her this sub last year, but I really don't care if she sees this,  maybe it'll hammer the point home. 
And I doubt she will see it as they are currently on their pre wedding honeymoon, legit didn't even know those were a thing. 
So Amy is getting married,  she has a blue and green and purple theme for the wedding. 
People are supposed to wear these colours including the moh and the bridesmaids. 
What irked me about that post was that my hair is NOT FLAMING MERIDA RED.
maybe slightly more [ginger] (https://ibb.co/w4yrCCk) in low light
This whole thing is completely insane to me and I have no idea where it has come from.

My [hair](https://ibb.co/y4dKsCZ) [2]
(https://ibb.co/3BVPgBf) [3](https://ibb.co/MD1V7NH) is what i would describe as strawberry blonde, maybe ginger blonde. 
Those are actual picture's of my hair not some poor stranger's instagram.
Things have been awkward from the start with Amy demanding that everyone has to stick to this dress code or they will be barred by security at the damn door.
She has also asked anyone with hair past their waist to cut it in a Facebook post but it got no replies and I can't think of anyone except me and maybe my sister with suoer long hair.
My mum and dad are both way more ginger than me and my sister who is 8 months pregnants hair is not much shorter than mine and is super ginger, and Amy never asked her to touch her hair? if anything I got the dull hair geane.

At first Amy called up to tell me she had made a post here,  I took a look and had to laugh to be honest,  She linked me early on clealry thinking people would agree with her but she said she was worried because it blew up. 

After things went south she decided to try and ""negotiate"" with me, still completely bizzare as my hair is not merida red.
My mum and dad called round a few days back to talk about it but got absolutely nowhere with her as she's still insisting i dye my hair a dark brown for the day or get a wig. 

My aunt,  Amy's mom called to apologise to me and asked me to please come but I don't feel welcome, can you imagine attending a wedding where the bride stares daggers at you the whole time? and what if the security refuse to let me in. 
[these](https://www.frenchnovelty.com/sean-couture-peacock-corset-back-ball-gown-prom-dress-70567) are extremely similar to the gowns the bridesmaids are going to wear, I've tired mine on and it absolutely dose not clash at all.
I brought and paid for my dress so I don't owe her anything but our families are so upset that I'm dropping out. 
But if I go I have no choice except to dye my hair as there never was a compromise or middle ground,  it was dye it,  buy a short brown bob wig or don't come. 
She specified it has to be a short brown bob wig for some reason.

AITA for telling a guy with autism off because he wouldn’t stop talking about something he knows nothing about?,"I (29f) am three years into my PhD. I have published many papers and been a co author of even more. I've done field studies and teach at a uni. Basically, I know my field.

I speak a few langues and teach a group of people outside of work. We meet up once a week and talk in that language. We are all friends and it's very casual. Last week one person of the group asked if they could bring a mate (K) from work who's interested in the language too. She said that her mate is on the spectrum and that he might not know when to stop talking. I said bring him along and we'll see how he fits in.

The actual lesson went well and I think we were all happy. Usually some people stick around for a bit after and we just have a few drinks. This is when it started. As it turns out K is interested in my field of study. He asked me some questions and I was happy to answer. But then it started getting weird. He kept arguing with me and ""correcting"" me, telling me what I apparently misunderstood and so on. It was quite awkward and my other friends tried to gently let him know that he was probably out of line. He kept asking me about my opinion on studies and papers but in an aggressive almost questioning way. 

The last straw was when he told me that I misinterpreted the findings of a study that I was a co author of. I was sick of it and said ""listen buddy, I know you think that you know everything about this field but if you had actually bothered to read who ""et al"" is then you'd know that I wrote this fucking paper so please just shut up"" not my proudest moment I admit but at this point he'd been trying to ""beat me"" for over 30 minutes. He left after that but later messaged me that he'd inform my uni of my discriminatory behaviour towards people with autism.

Now I'm wondering if I went too far.

AITA for telling my mom to not have any more kids?,"   I(16F) live with my parents and 11 siblings. I'm the 4th kid, and the ages range from 20 to 1.

AITA for kicking my boyfriend's parents out of our apartment after his mom called me a bitch?,"Back in March his parents decided they wanted to come ""wait quarantine out"" at our apartment. For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. 

Out of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said ""Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work"". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. 

I go into the guest room and say ""Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house."" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, ""You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before."" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. 

Now my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free. I also got tired of my boyfriend refusing to defend me and allowing her to say and do whatever she wanted. I am trying to understand their perspective although it just doesn't seem reasonable to me.

AITA for telling my drywall guy to stop bugging my babysitter?,"We are doing some house renovations and so workers are in the house. Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I’m working in my downstairs office. 

I hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. 
IE: 
Guy: So where do you live ? 
Her: North of here
Guy: Yeah but where?
Her: It’s kind of a weird spot

That’s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, “What is this? The census? She’s watching my kid. Let her be. “ I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. 

I get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. 

Am I the A-hole?


Update: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won’t be back. To quote her, “The thirsty ones never get the hint.”

The most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, “If you think that was bad you should check out my DM’s”. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It’s just street flashing with less effort. It’s insane and it’s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. 

My wife is deflecting from whether I’m still the a-hole but I’ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It’s a give and take like anything in this world. 

Anyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the “thirsty” ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media.",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking out my dad and his pregnant wife out of the home I legally own after they sent my depressed sister to live with our aunt?,"My mother passed away 3 years ago. The family home, where I and my sister grew up, was willed to me. It was her ancestral property, and she wanted her daughter to have it. The other vacation home went to my 16 year old sister.

Our father remarried 6 months after mom passed away and moved his new wife in. My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well. Now all of these pictures adorn the walls of my sister's room.

Recently our father and his wife announced that they were pregnant with twins. My sister didn't take it well. She's still not over mom's death and had a breakdown after the announcement.

The night of my sister's 16th birthday party, she brought a lot of friends over and the party went on till the next morning.

My dad's wife, who was out with our father on vacation returned the same morning and lost her cool when she saw the kids passed out on the living room. Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.

His wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.

I was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.

My father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.

I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.

It was annoying how the ""outside judge""kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??

It was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.

So I went up and said ""Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.""

She sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. 

The girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.

My principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detention

AITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?

Edit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?","I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

However, despite being a ""supporter,"" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, ""You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that I look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.

These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. 

Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""Maybe he's into curvier girls."" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for buying a $50,000 guitar for $4,000 and refusing to sell it back when the buyer found out the real value?","This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.

Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he ""looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair"". I texted back, ""I'll take it for $4,000"" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.

Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, ""well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask."" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to ""sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam."" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.

AITA?

UPDATE: 

Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:

The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.

The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.

I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would ""do bad things"" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.

And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?,"So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she’s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I’m hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I’ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it’s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter “where’s the rest of my steak?” and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don’t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it’s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it’s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

I’m complaining to my girlfriend and she’s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I’m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. 

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that’s where we’re different, I don’t let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don’t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald’s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It’s now the next day and I’m starting to think I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn’t responded to my texts so now I’m starting to think I’m an asshole.

AITA for changing my name? my parents named me Qur'stylle (Chrystal)?,"So my asshole scumbag parents named me Qur'stylle and my whole life i have gotten shit like ""are you muslim"" ""what language is your name originated from?"" ""what country are you from"" and people butchering its pronunciation, for obvious reasons. I have always told people to just spell it as Chrystal and my parents (mainly mom) would take huge offense to it and would email my teachers every year to make sure they pronounce my name correctly. 

My mom even grounded me once because I told people to just make save my name as Chrystal in their contacts. Now that I'm a legal adult i got my named changed to Chrystal so now i don't have to deal with this fuckign bullshit for the rest of my life. Having this bullshit spelling and having to correct everyone everyday was annoying as hell and everyone before they met me would always think I'm some spoiled brat bitch when that isn't true at all. Your name affects how people see you, much of it is subconscious, and having these bullshit spellings is not good. 

My mom lost her shit and started crying and threatened to cut me off for doing this. She said i betrayed her and our family by doing this. Im pretty sure I'm in the right but i need a sanity check here. I told my mom to go fuck herself and fuck her for causing me all these problems in my life and not supporting me and taking my complaints into considerations over my own fuckign name.

AITA for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children,"Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn’t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.

I’ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they’re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn’t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?

Edit- okay I get it I’m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn’t think the triplets had different fathers. I’m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",Asshole
AITA? My husband won’t let me sleep.,"Ok, so I work 12 to 16 hour shifts at an extremely labor intensive job that requires the use of heavy machinery. My job is dangerous and I need to stay focused while at work. This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled.

AITA for going no-contact with my parents after learning they had lied to me about my allergies all my life?,"Hey everyone. I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.

For as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:

* Dairy

* Wheat/Flour/Gluten

* Legumes

Since I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. 

I never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.

I noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.

It didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.

I was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. 

She has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got ""carb addicted."" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.

AITA for telling my grandparents about my stepsiblings destroying my jewelry?,"My mother died when I was 10. My father married a goyishe woman less than a year later, who promptly did her best to have as many children as she could, and had 3 in as many years. She has two older kids too, who are 8 and 7 now. 6 kids is a lot, but it's a pretty big house. 

I'm the only grandchild on my mother's side, and the only granddaughter on either side. My grandparents typically gift me jewelry, and I got my mother's collection when she died. As a religious custom, we don't really do costume jewelry. All of my jewelry is real and not cheap. It sounds vulgar, but my entire jewelry collection is worth about 100k easily. 

I came home from seeing a friend and the oldest three had a PILE of my jewelry on the floor of their playroom. They had been jumping on it, smashing it and shooting at it with BB guns (yeah, my father allows that apparently). I screamed and got my father, who came with his wife and dismissed the entire thing.  

They destroyed multiple pieces, several of which were heirloom. My stepmother didn't really care. She pretended to yell at her brats. She later came home with a dollar store necklace that she ""made"" the kids get me and said that that should be enough and that I shouldn't have such ""idols"" or wear such ""sacrilegious crap"" (one of my necklaces is a star of david). 

I saw red at that. I got her to repeat it so I could record it. I emailed all of my grandparents, aunts and uncles detailing what happened, attaching the recording and pictures of the damage, and then I went to those brats' playroom and destroyed one of each of their favorite toys.

"AITA for refusing to share a room with a 1yr old, twin 2yr olds and a 4yr old?","So I F(18) was recently invited up to my aunt and uncle’s (I’ll call them aunt and uncle B) ranch house for the 4th of July, and told I could bring a friend. Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the “kids room” which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They’ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.

The other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I’ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.

H’s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I’ve been to their house before, it’s horrible). 

Anyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G’s shared one).

I was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.

Cue a MASSIVE explosion.

The baby cannons are pissed that I don’t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he’s a “growing boy” and he “doesn’t know how to take care of kids”.

None of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn’t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.

Cue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can’t stay. At this point, I’m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn’t know what to do.

So I tell them I’m leaving.
Cue more screaming.
I drove up my father’s boat, if I leave, there’s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.

I say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we’re leaving.

Well, baby cannons weren’t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.

Now I’m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I’m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. 

AITA here?

UPDATE 7/1; My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?"," My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.

My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though I don't need it?,"I hate flying to the point that I will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. It's not that I'm scared of flying, I just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

So I only fly if I can buy a second seat (or third if I'm flying with my wife). It lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. Also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class AND for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. I'm a big guy but I 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

On multiple flights I've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no I bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

AITA for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? If I was willing to fly with one seat I wouldn't have bought a second seat.

AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?,"Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?

Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- I was wearing headphones all the time.

\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.

\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering,"Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:

VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...

Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.

VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.

Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.

\*silence\*

VT: I'll be right back.

...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...

VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.

Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.

VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.

Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.

VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.

Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?

VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.

Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.

VT: I'll be right back.

...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?

\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:

1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.
2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.
3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).
4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.
5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.

AITA for kicking out a girl from my daughter's sleepover bday party?,"My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.

There was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.

The whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a ""super duper cool girl"".

Anyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)

The final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.

the SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.

My daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying ""why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??"". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.

My daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:

D ""hey its me""

SB ""thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha""

D ""what""

SB: ""arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts""

SB ""slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool""

D ""u dont like the party..?""

SB ""I jus wish i could go home looool""

\~end

It was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).

I took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said ""because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go."" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.

I talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said ""its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.""

I thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.

My wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for going to my sister’s dream school when she just got rejected?,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

So, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I’m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...

My twin sister is the opposite of me. She’s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn’t and still don’t mind, it’s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

Well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

Well anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I’m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don’t know how but I did. 

I really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she’s been crying and solemn and sad. She’s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). 

Am I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. 

Am I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...

TLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?

UPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. 

Well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn’t I tell her earlier and she’s so proud of me

But seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

I going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

Update 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn’t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update 

So after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:

> I’m sorry for how I reacted; please don’t be mad. I’m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It’s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you’re going to be where I wanted to be and I’m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I’m sorry I’m ranting I just need more time

I’m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don’t. I don’t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I’m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don’t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we’re going to drift apart which would suck because we’re best friends and I just don’t want to lose my sister :(

Update 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). 

Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.

I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.

I still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.

Update 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)",Not the A-hole
AITA for cutting off my mother when she got a paternity test for my daughter?,"I've been with my wife for 8 years. We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.

Edit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.

Visibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.

My mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.

Then a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.

Last week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.

It's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her ""special little guy"" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.

I feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.

AITA for leaving the family restaurant and starting my own after finding out I wouldn't inherit it?,"My dad owns a pizza place that was handed down to him from my grandfather.

I've been working at the pizza place my while life, even part time while I got a business degree.

I found out last early last year that my dad had willed the restaurant to my stepmom. His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.

I was pissed and ""quit"" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.

Now this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. 

My dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.

I declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.

The family restaurant however, is going under.  

Now there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.

AITA For walling off my backyard because I dislike 2 kids and depriving everyone else as a result?,"I sure feel like TA but I don't think I am so help me out here.

I live in a non English speaking European country and because of history that means land borders between properties are sometimes very weird. Well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge I own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.

Now the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. 

The field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and I always allow it on the condition I get no complaints if I tell them to leave and they don't litter. 

I also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.

Well this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. I kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. I keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when I tell them to. A month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when I got them out and went to their parents they just said ""Oh we figured it was a public pool"", I had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days I was away from my house and when I got back I found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.

That was the last straw for me and I hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when I used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked I told them why I was doing that and who they could thank for it.

Well now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kids

AITA for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?,"My sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

AITA for suing my biological father for unpaid child support?,"I don't have a relationship with my biological father. He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I'm her only child. He's never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. 

While I couldn't independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.

"AITA for having security at my mother's funeral, having certain people barred entry?","My parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.

My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.

Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.

Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).

edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?

There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.

Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.

This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. 

Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not ""trying harder"" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart.

AITA for telling my husband he “should have just married a white woman”,"For context I’m a black woman and my husband is white. I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don’t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. 

I used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I’ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don’t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. 

First night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it’s the little comments when I get into bed. Like “are we doing the slave tonight?” Or “should I help you into bed grandma?” Little things like that. I’ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn’t like it and my hope was that he’d get used to it by now. 

Last night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn’t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he’d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn’t tell me where. He wouldn’t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman. 

He got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven’t talked much about it but there’s this air of awkwardness. The only times he mentioned it was this morning when he said that we should look into counseling for our “race issues” and that I made him feel really racist and I didn’t think about it that way. 

I thought he was upset because I yelled at him but I didn’t think it was the statement itself (granted I probably should not have brought race into it but I wanted to illustrate a point.) Now he’s suggesting couples counseling to get through our “race issues”? I don’t think it was that serious and I don’t want to go through all that. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister to stop telling people that she has my illness to gain sympathy for being overweight?,"I (22f) have an older sister (25f). My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like ""I prefer pink over blue"" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm ""emotionally stronger"" than her. 

My parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. 

I was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. 

My sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has ""Euthyrox"" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. 

She's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.

I'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. 

My parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic ""I should apologise since I'm more mature"". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. 

I ask them ""so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?"" 

Now they're mad at me too.",Not the A-hole
AITA for sending my son to school in a dress,"My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

He's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said ""I want to wear this."" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

I figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

I drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

My wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

At the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my parents they made my sister getting pregnant ruin my life?,"shes 23f im 18F. Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.

In sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.

Mom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.

Boy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.

I broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.

I said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.

everything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.

moms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.

Did I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.

I've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.

3000 char limit is an AH


EDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.

edit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.


EDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.


EDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all right

edit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not allowing my father to meet my dying mother at the hospital?,"I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. 



My father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. 

My mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. 

She was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. 

My mother was devastated and stopped eating properly.


 In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. 

All this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. 

During her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. 

When he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) 

My mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.

I believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time.
 
---------

Edit : I want to make some facts clear -

1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. 


2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.

-------------

Edit 2 :


3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. 

In fact, she didn't mention him at all. 

4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.

We have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.

I plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support.",Not the A-hole
AITA for acting like a conspiracy theorist to get out of political arguments with my Dad?,"My Dad loves to have political arguments/“discussions” with me and other members of the family. I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for “not participating with the family dynamic” and “never talking to him.” I also don’t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I’ve been looking for a redirect for a while. 

I read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says “they faked the moon landing” you say “haha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?” I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.

My Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, “oh, you’ve heard that, well get this” and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I’ve been doing it even more, and I haven’t had a political argument in a whole month. 

This Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the “death of Planned Parenthood.” Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn’t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, “oh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned” and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it’s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. 

I received a lecture about “not taking people’s political views seriously” from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, “you’re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.”",Not the A-hole
AITA for not inviting the neighborhood snitch or the HOA board to our neighborhood BBQ?,"There's around 10 houses in my neighborhood of 120 that are not in the HOA, mine included. We (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the HOA. As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.

I made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are ""boycotting"" my party and hosting their own party. The party happened and nobody else showed up to theirs and ours was a blast. She apparently cried over it.

"AITA for ""forcing"" my boyfriend to do the dishes?","I’m lactose intolerant.

This came to a head last night when we were having tacos again. I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed my taco looked tampered with. I go to inspect, and lo and behold, there’s fucking cheese buried underneath the other ingredients.

AITA for not donating my liver due to a lawsuit and the person died?,"My (24M) partner's (23F) close friend and boss (50'sM) at the mechanic shop needed a liver transplant. They had been on the list for a while and getting nowhere. Lots of us got tested and I was a match. We were all happy and thrilled that this direct donation could take place.

A week before the surgery date, police showed up at our house to arrest my partner as her boss (person who was getting a piece of my liver) had accused her of theft. Claimed she'd stolen thousands from his bank account and stolen from the cash box. The police showed us the Cctv in which she reaches into the box, takes money and walks out of frame. 15 times, 15 days, 15 accusations. The police admitted they had no proof it was theft and no clue on the amounts taken as she used the box to take customers money and change. The police also said they didn't see how she accessed the bank accounts, and that they felt this was some sort of insurance fraud and they needed a scape goat.

I immediately rang the hospital and my transplant coordinator and backed out of the surgery. We got on with our lives, partner found a new job and attended the court date where the case was thrown out 6 months later. 

A week after the case was dismissed, we got word boss had died. No one else had been a match or willing to get tested after news got out, and they never found a match in the transplant system in time.

I feel so guilty. I allowed someone to die, pretty much murdered them. I let pettiness get in the way of saving a life. Partner and friends feel I did the right thing, none of this is on me and not giving a piece of me to the person possibly putting my partner in prison for a long time, a week before surgery, is my choice and the right choice. 

Bosses friends and family have been ringing non-stop, harassing us at our jobs and posting online a lot how I'm a murderer and killed boss. That I should have given the liver anyway and been a good person. 

I feel I should have given it, but who bites the hand that feeds? I didn't want to get cut open, risk dying and other complications for someone who didn't care for me and mine, but now someone is dead from something I could have prevented. I'm conflicted and losing sleep over this. 

AITA for not giving my liver to the person accusing partner of theft and them later dying?

Edit: thank you for all the positive and informative feedback. I think seeing the outside, impartial view on this has helped me put it in perspective. I've only been focusing on my selfishness causing his death, as opposed to his actions contributing too. I'll be getting some counselling, as suggested, to help deal with the constant what ifs in my brain and to help me move past this and to stop shouldering the burden.

Edit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the awards and positive vibes everyone, much appreciated. 
Clearing up a few things
- gf didn't steal, she was just doing her job getting change/paying invoices. The wife (who admitted to stealing later) simply used footage of her accessing the cash box to try to make it seem like she stole. I didn't state she was innocent as its innocent until proven guilty, and she wasn't found guilty, my mistake. 
- it's been pointed out that with boss so unwell, perhaps it wasn't him doing this, but his wife. That's a great point I never considered, and now makes me feel even more guilty. I should have checked.
- we are in the UK so I guess our legal system works differently to the States in that I didn't have to pay a bail, just simply take her home and take her to the court dates. This could be why the policemen told us straight it seemed like bull and were very candid and kind to us; they even bought us lunch when one went to Subway.
- also as said, the surgery would have probably been cancelled anyway as I did have another welfare check (or two) scheduled for that week with the transplant team at the hospital and I was hugely stressed out. My work gave me that week and the following off anyway for being such a good sport.
- thanks for the dm's calling me a murderer, appreciated....",Not the A-hole
AITA for having pot cookies out in the open in my own home?,"this is an ongoing situation, and am currently writing this as my niece is having a full-on meltdown. so I apologize for any mistakes.

today was my day off and i decided to whip up a batch of pot cookies (cookies that have weed extract in them) so i can snack on them for the weekend. after they finish baking i left them out on a cooling tray so they can set. just as i finished cleaning up the kitchen i hear the door bell and went to answer, and surprise surprise it's my sister with 8yo niece and husband. it's been awhile since I've last seen them to it was a happy surprise. i let them in, and the smell of cookies still in the air, and niece goes bolting towards the kitchen. 

i instantly go chasing her and as i round the corner into the kitchen, niece had just grabbed a cookie and was about to eat it, quick on my feet i swooped in and grabbed the cookie out of her hand saying that these were adult cookies. which caused niece to start freaking out. my sister followed in and i explained to her that these cookies had pot in them and assured her i was able to take the cookie away from niece before she had ate any.

she instantly blows up at me saying i shouldn't have pot cookies out when there are kids in the house, i explained how i had just finished baking them and they were setting, and the fact that i didn't expect ANY children to be around (i am a single man, no kids), she asked if i had any thing that wasn't ""laced"" and unfortunately i didn't, by this point niece has locked herself in the bathroom and is crying.

and my sister gave me a big ol' lecture about having drugs in reach of kids, while i stand on the premise of, there wouldn't be an issue *if i had even known they were planning on dropping by today.* she called me a huge irresponsible asshole, and i responded ""well maybe if you taught your daughter to not just grab shit, we wouldn't be in this mess!""

she left to try to get niece out of the bathroom and i'm sat here typing this, am i really the asshole here? like i can understand not having drugs out in the open with kids around, and i never would - *if i had known there were going to be kids around.*

AITA for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him “uncomfortable”?,"Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife’s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She’s 22, I’ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She’s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She’s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

But then my wife goes, “And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he’s 47.”

I’m 41, my wife is 42. I was like “You’re kidding, right?”

She wasn’t kidding. At first, I was like “Hell no.” But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I’m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.

1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it’s weird).

2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman’s history with her father? 

5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

I know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. 

After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. 

I told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.

So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?

EDIT: some info:

I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.

I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.

I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.

Edit 2: Some of you here asked what’s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They’re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. 

Talked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless.

AITA for telling everyone exactly why I'm getting divorced?,"My ex and I have one child together. We found out during my pregnancy that our child would be deaf, and wouldn't qualify for the surgery that some deaf people are able to get due to a combination of problems. While the external issue is a fluke, the internal issue is apparently something that I always had a 25% chance of passing down to a child. 

Not to toot my own horn, but once I learned this, I made an effort to start connecting with the Deaf community in my area and learn ASL. He did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. I own the house, and did before I met him, so it's not part of the divorce. He was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to GrubHub. 

He ended up telling everyone that I am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that I filed for divorce because I overreacted.  The truth is that I have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't ""deal"" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. While I did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that I couldn't get over. 

I have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce ""problems"" and that he couldn't handle raising a ""r******"" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). I don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. 

I was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so I took action.

AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?,"My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her.

AITA for telling a friend’s friend that he couldn’t keep the “jackpot” that he hit on my antique slot machine? (About $700),"I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I’m a “baby gangster” who has been running an “illegal gaming operation” (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I’m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I’ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the “winner” thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN’T be this dramatic in real life...I’m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I’m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don’t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don’t  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.


Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",Asshole
AITA for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?,"A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated ""No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you."" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

Yesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.

A few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

Was I in the wrong?

Edit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.

Edit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.

Edit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.",Not the A-hole
AITAH for giving guardianship of my son to my aunt over my mother after I die of my terminal cancer,"I (21m) have a son who just turned 1, his mum who was my girlfriend died in labour along with the other baby she was carrying. I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 months ago and I don't have very long left (two months at most) I have accepted that I'm going to die but now I have to think about what's best for my son.

I had to decide who my boy would go to and I thought my mother(55) naturally but then I started to think of her situation as my older(29) lives with her along with his 5 kids all aged under 5 and I decided not to as mum works and my brother tbh isn't really raising his kids, more dragging them up and can be neglectful. I wasn't going to put my son in that environment as I want someone to actually care for him. So I then thought of my aunt(33) on my dads side. she is a good mother and her husband a good father to their 3 girls and I know they could provide for my son. I asked them and they agreed.

My mother however found out that I wasn't leaving my son with her and she got angry with me, that she's loosing me and now loosing her grandson. I gave her my reasons and that she realistically can't raise him while she's basically raising a man-child and his kids. It all ended in an even bigger argument and now I'm cooling off at home. I understand that things are terrible for her right now as I won't be here soon but my aunt is a much better choice. It's not like my son won't know who she is as the walk between hers and my aunts is only 5 minutes.

AITA for not telling my ex I got pregnant,"I (28 F) was with my ex-husband for about 6 years. During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. 

About 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to ‘relieve’ it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. 

I was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  

It wasn’t. My ex’s family treated me like their own, but my ex’s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn’t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. 

People thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn’t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. 

Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn’t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. 

However, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn’t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex’s fault. He took a paternity test. 

The poor baby girl was NEVER my ex’s. The coworker apparently was dating this ‘terrible’ guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn’t know who the child’s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he’d be the best father for her child. 

Now my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He’s doing pretty bad now and I can’t help but feel guilty like I should’ve told him.

EDIT: I didn’t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. 

Okay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I’m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I’ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). 

I don’t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn’t after everything that happened between us. They’re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should’ve. 

EDIT: So here’s what’s been happening right now, I haven’t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex’s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing ‘people who were never really family’ over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn’t biologically his, she’s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex‘s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won’t contribute to that but he says that he’s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).",Not the A-hole
AITA for DEMANDING my SIL replace the expensive fabric she and her children DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?,"I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.

We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.

On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.

I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.

I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.

After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.

Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.

I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.

Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.

AITA?

**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.

**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.

**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",Not the A-hole
AITA? Suing my neighbor after she sprayed weedicide on my lawn,"Caught my neighbor spraying weedicide on my lawn (in my fenced in backyard) because she said “she was sick of all the weeds” and thought she was doing me a solid.

1. I like dandelions they are good for the bees

2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it’s literally poisoning my pets.

So anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.

Now 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I’ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) 

So I’m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.

I’m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. 

She’s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it’s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I’m not risking another animal’s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I’m being unnecessarily cruel because it “was an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is” and should just ask for her to pay my vet bills

Edit: info, she has asked me about the weeds before

I don’t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines of

Her: “hey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too” 

Me: “yup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn” 

Her: “Something about my new car.”

The end

Since she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she’d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn’t get to that week would be sprouting

Edit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.

Edit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said “it’s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick”

Edit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn’t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can’t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.

UPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. 

My 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He’ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready 

For those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.

Also I’ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven’t responded, probably won’t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. 

And for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn’t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.

I have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE.

"AITA for letting my brother call me ""dad"" and refusing to tell him the ugly truth?","I'm well aware that this story sounds extremely hard to believe and fake, and I'm aware that there will be many ""shitpost"" comments below. Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.

I was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.

Josh, now almost 13, has been calling me ""dad"" and my wife ""mum"" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.

Some of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me ""dad"" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.

I discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the ""father figure"" everyone deserves.

I feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?



**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying ""sooner than later"". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys.",Not the A-hole
AITA for cutting my kid’s day out short?,"I’ve been looking after my daughter (13) alone for the past few months because my wife is stranded abroad and can’t get back into the country due to COVID. It’s been pretty good mostly because I’ve been able to work from home.  Yesterday however I had a critical work meeting about a major contract so to avoid distractions I sorted out a play date with one of my daughter’s friends for the day, and I dropped her to the friends house about an hour away. 

I drive over, I drop her and drive back by about half 10. I’m about 20 mins into what should be a 2/3 contract negotiation when I get a text from my kid asking if we can get McDonald’s on the way back. Now, that was a ‘code’ message I’d said to her saying that if you’re feeling uncomfortable with the situation or what’s going on, text or call me or mum that, we’ll come and get you wherever you are and it wouldn’t be obvious to anyone listening that she’s trying to get away. I text her back “All okay?” and she texts back saying “I’m very hungry, please get McDonald’s on the way back”. 

At this I’m worried, so i make my excuses to my partners (who were annoyed by my dipping out) and I start to rush over there. When I get there, everything is fine. Turns out, it was just a ’prank’. She’d told her friend about the message and they both thought how cool it’d be if they made me drive back up again. 

I was incensed. I told her that was the end of the play date and how disappointed I was. I also said we were going back home that instant. I made my apologies to the friend’s mum and took my kid home. 

My daughter complained to her mum how I cut play date short and now she wasn’t allowed to go out with another friend the next week. My wife spoke to me and said she agrees with me that our daughter did wrong, but said it might be easier for everyone if we let her go out next week. I said no, and that not only had she made it hard to trust her again if she is in genuine danger (which is the worst thing) she also (unknowingly) lost my company six figures in lost business. I had to email my side of the presentation to a partner and bc it wasn’t their area of expertise and they didn’t impress the client. 

While I know that isn’t directly her fault I still believe that actions should have consequences, and it doesn’t make my particularly vindictive to see those followed through.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my grandma she looks like Ronald McDonald because she wouldn’t stop telling me I look like a bull with my nose ring in?,"Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I’d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.

Here’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she’s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I’m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn’t even make sense) does not “ruin” my face and even if it does it’s really not her place. I’m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

AITA for putting my dog's wee-wee pads on the bathroom floor b/c my BF has bad aim and keeps missing the toilet?,"My boyfriend (30/M) and I (28/F) have been together about a year and when our city implemented lockdown for the virus, he decided to quarantine with me at my apartment as I live alone and have a nicer apartment and he has several roommates.

Mostly it has been going well and thankfully we both still have jobs, except in the first few weeks I started noticing that the bathroom floor was suddenly always wet around the toilet. (The sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) At first I thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. I asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.

The floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later I confronted him about it again because I think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. If he misses the toilet, I think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a Clorox wipe. (The cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) He said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. 

Another week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, I've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. I thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because I don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.

Last night I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. I had HAD it and I didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so I got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of ""skirt"" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. 

BF saw this morning and is FURIOUS with me, saying that I'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. Honestly, I was not thinking that at all, I just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since I don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, I didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution.

AITA for reporting my teacher over a very uncomfortable joke?,"I (F20) have been in a bakery course since September and every Wednesday we have an 8 hour hands on class. The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. 

Last week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. 

It's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. 

So today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. 

Now he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first.

AITA for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?,"First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?,"I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a ""trip"" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. 

Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. 

I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.

I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.

Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.

So, AITA?

Edit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full complete custody of them.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for letting my 7 year old daughter call my husband ""daddy"", against the wishes of her biological father (my ex husband)?","My ex husband left me when I was 2 months pregnant. When my daughter turned 4 months old, he married his current wife. I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. 

My ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. 

We never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.

Now, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. 

Here's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. 

The other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying ""mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!""

When my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man ""daddy"" and that I needed to make her stop.

 I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife ""mommy"". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. 

The next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. 

My husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him ""daddy""?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids.",Not the A-hole
AITA for banning my father from my home because he banned me from his when I was younger?,"When I was 15, my father married a woman I just could not get along with. And there was a lot of friction with her daughter as well.

Eventually, the fighting got so bad that my father told me that he would exercise his custody at my grandparents house instead, effectively banning me from his own home.

I said thanks but no thanks and stopped seeing him as per the custody schedule.

He did make attempts to fix our relationship but I wasn't interested. We would see each other at family events and we were nice enough to each other but that's it.

It's now 13 years later and I'm married with a 1 year old.

His wife has passed away in an accident a few years ago and I'm assuming he's lonely now.

But I don't really want to be his backup plan.

He comes to see my son once a month and I only see him at the park and don't engage much with him myself.

Last December, he point blank asked me why I never invited him to my home for dinner or why I never accepted his invites to visit him.

I told him the the truth. He was very upset but it's the reality of the situation.

AITA for not letting my cousin experience motherhood?,"I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer. It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.

They started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.

I had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for ""a few weeks"". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.

It's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.

I'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.

I'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.

I said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I ""popped them out so close together"". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA

EDIT/UPDATE:

Yesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin).",Not the A-hole
AITA for catfishing my underaged sister on Tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?,"Last week, I was using my sister Ashley’s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger’s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a “fucking dick” and “cruel” to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who’s right and if I went too far?

EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would’ve had sex with Jim. That’s why I went the extent that I did.

Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I’m TA. But I’m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. 

And to the people who said she’ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",Asshole

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, I'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life.

"AITA for asking for pocket money because ""I am a kid too""","I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.

AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband camps in the bathroom for extended lengths of time.,"My husband and I are the parents of twins who are less than a year old. Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.

My husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )

I would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.

It's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. 

Yesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.

Today I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.

TLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.

Edit: to answer questions that people have been asking.

Yes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.

Yes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office.",Not the A-hole
AITA for changing the package pickup each time someone uses my email for orders?,"So pretty much, there’s this guy who keeps ordering things with my email. He isn’t using any other personal information of mine so i don’t think it’s a privacy concern. 

So back to the point, I will occasionally get emails from random websites about an order confirmation. I’ve never heard of most of those websites and I know for a fact none of my family members used my email to buy something.

With most emails, there’s a number, name and an address (I’m assuming it’s the persons address) attached. I’ve tried texting the number and even calling but I’ve never gotten an answer. 

I’d always get emails from ups to confirm the pickup/drop off area. Ever since I’ve gotten the emails, I always change the location for delivery. So instead of it being delivered at his doorstep, it gets shipped to a post office 20 miles away. He can’t change that since like I said, it’s all attached to my email.

I recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical. (Imagine mine is “abc” his is “acb”) so he always switches one letter therefore I get the emails. 

In his email, he calls me an asshole for making the pickup so far. When I asked him why can’t he just use his own email he said: It’s always a typo I do and I don’t feel like fixing it because it takes too much time.

I’m not even joking, that’s exactly what he said.

"AITA if I ""cancel"" Christmas because I can't afford it this year?","Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.


UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough ""things"" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on ""giving"" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a ""new tradition"" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.

To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",Asshole
AITA for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?,"Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn’t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn’t even have Candy Crush on her phone.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn’t do it).

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn’t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

AITA?

AITA for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?,"I'm 19f and live at home with my family. My younger brother 'Mike' is 14. He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

One of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
Now yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

My boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",Not the A-hole
AITA for propositioning a girl in the gym?,"Please hear me out before you judge because while I did say what you’re thinking I didn’t say it in the way you’re thinking.

The gym I go to is very small. Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don’t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend “Ugh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.”

I shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I’m not entirely sure if it’s an actual well known exercise) 

The same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf “Look there she goes again, and her forms terrible.” Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

At this point I call her out. I said “Oi, you.” She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically “You in the purple top.” 

She turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:

Me; Do you want to fuck me?
Her: What?!
Me: I said do you want to fuck me?
Her: What the fuck is wrong with you?
Me: Well you keep staring at me, so I’m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

She went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn’t see them again.

When I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

My defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn’t talk shit if she doesn’t want called out on it.

I’ll admit that I’m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my husband to check on me while playing video games?,"My husband is an avid computer gamer - mostly WoW-type games. Approximately five nights of the week, he'll play games online from the time that our son goes to bed at 8:00 or 8:30 to about 12:30, so at least four continuous hours. That in itself is not at all an issue for our relationship. He spends plenty of time with me and our son, and I have my own hobbies that he isn't interested in that I engage in when he's online.

A few nights ago I was doing laundry while he was playing online, and I stepped on a toy that my son had left on the basement stairs. I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine. The laundry basket clattered down the stairs, ricocheted off some basement furniture, shot laundry everywhere. It was a huge racket. It woke up my son. My husband, who had his headphones on, heard literally nothing.

It dawned on me that if something really bad happened to me, my husband wouldn't know about it for potentially four hours - like what if I broke my leg falling down the stairs? So I asked if he would be willing, for my peace of mind, to just pop out of his office at the mid-point each night just to check on me. Like literally, just say hi and go back to gaming. He thinks this is a huge overreaction and a waste of time. I know for a fact that he isn't actively playing the entire time and he sometimes takes breaks to go to the bathroom or get a snack or whatever, so how is this different? AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for rejecting the role of ""cool aunt"" because it was really more like unpaid babysitter?","My sister and I have always been very different. Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.

I always felt kind of ""different"" from the others because I'm not very ""geeky"" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.

Well, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is ""Harry Potter"" themed.

Due to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.

Except the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said ""It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.""

I was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.

I said ""I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.""

She was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of ""chasing popularity and doing my nails"" maybe I would have more in common with them.

I'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were ""too advanced"" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were ""dumb books for vapid little girls.""

**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? ",Not the A-hole
AITA For walking out of my father's funeral?,"Thowaway account for obvious reasons.

Important info:

- I'm a caucasian F, early 30's. Married to a lovely mixed M and we have a 2yr old.

- I've cut contact with my family about 5yrs ago, mostly due to my mother's narcissistic behaviour and her being pretty darn racist (she hated me dating my now husband), and the rest of my family condoning the crap she put us up with. 

- Most of my other relatives cut ties withwith my family before I was born or shortly after, I'm thinking it's once again because of my mother. The only one that kept in touch was one aunt, from my father's side.

This happened yesterday.


Last friday I got a call from my aunt that my dad got into an accident 2 days prior and didn't make it (he died on impact apparently). She asked me if I'd heard anything from my family, to which I replied 'no' (important to know that I've been using the same cellphone number and email since I was 18 or so). She figured they forgot and asked me if I wanted to come to the funeral. After a few minutes of thinking I told her I'd come if my family was okay with it and if SHE wanted me to, I explained to her that I wouldn't be going for myself or my father/family, just to support her. She said she'd want me there as she'd have no other support and called me later to tell me my family was okay with me coming.

So, yesterday was the day of the funeral. The past few days I did not hear a single thing from my family. When I got to the location my family members jumped right on top of me, telling me how happy they were that I came/that we should go to dinner/told me all kinds of stories about thing that happened the last 5yrs........they basically acted like those 5yrs didn't happed and we weren't there for a funeral. I know grieve does things to people, so I let it slide and played along, but it made me feel really uneasy and I made sure not to give any details about my own family or job, as they know nothing about that and I wanted to keep it that way as it was not the time and place for an argument about my husband.
During the ceremony they insisted I sat next to my mother. Everything started out okay, but when it was time for speeches, my family insisted I'd speak. I quietly told them no, that I had nothing prepared, but they didn't accept it. So I got up and quickly said 'he'll be missed' and sat down again. They visibly were not happy with me and my mother started shouting at me, telling me I was a worthless bitch, that I'd always treated them without any respect and that I was a bicth for not giving an actual speech about how amazing my father was in front of the +150 people that had shown up.

So, I looked at her for a few seconds, mostly trying to figure out wth just happened..........stood up, told her to enjoy the rest of her day and walked out.

My husband told me I did the right thing and he was proud of me for keeping my cool instead of starting a shouting match, so is my aunt........but I've been bombarded with messages from people that say I went too far. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto FB who died during the 9/11 attacks?,"I lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when TWC towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.",Asshole
AITA for forcing a confession out of my wife about spying on my kids therapy sessions,"So for those that don’t know, I have two children M20 and F19 and ever since the world went to hell, I got them therapy sessions at their requests because they said that this was taking a huge toll on them.

On Wednesday when my daughter went to attend the zoom session my wife had left to go take a nap. I didn't think much of it, but she came back exactly 3 hours later after both of them finished looking sad. Today the same thing happened and when I went to wake her up for dinner today I found her watching a recording of my daughter’s session. I lost it. That conversation was supposed I will be private we had promised our kids that we will respect their privacy and do our best to help them when they need it.

I made her confess to our kids and told her. They were heartbroken and they hate her. She claims that it’s my fault but she dug her own grave. 

Both of them feel betrayed and don't want anything to do with their mother. So Reddit am I the asshole for forcing a confession??

Minor update:

Hey so many of you wanted an update, but it’s too soon to tell what will actually happen.
As of now my soon to be ex-wife is staying at a friends house. I did receive some calls from her and her friends about how I’m an asshole but after I explained everything to her friends they apologised and sided with me.

My kids do want a divorce but I feel as tho she has already put that plan into motion. I’m not too worry as I am able to afford better lawyers than her. My kids are actually grateful that I did what I did because they now realised that their mom is a control freak. Funny enough a friend had found the post after a mutual friend told them and showed it to my wife.

AITA for telling my new neighbours that I've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?,"I've been away since Thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently Sunday afternoon where I live.  Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

My 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes ""Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it."" (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said ""I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox."" I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

She seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.

Just before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnapped

AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?,"Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.

Background: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.

We were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'

He replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.

We didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'

I was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.

He told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??

He screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.

I tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.

I'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. 

His mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.

AITA for not speaking to my parents again after they put my cat down,"For context: I'm 28, the vets office is literally 10 minutes away.

I had them take him because I have two herniated disks and can't carry the carrier and open the multiple doors and hold the carrier without fear of dropping it.  I thought he had a little cold with the only reasoning being that his ears felt a little warm, he wasn't eating as much as he normally does and he was due for his shots anyway. So I cooked dinner for all of us while they took him to the vet on my dime. I called them after an hour and asked how things were going and my father told me everything was good and he had a little fever. Fast forward another hour, they come back and let themselves in and I open the door to my mother sobbing and my father slinking in the corner. Turns out the vet found a large mass on his Kidney and suspected it was stage 3-4 cancer. So my parents, without calling me, had him put down to ""spare my feelings"".

I told them both to leave and that I never wanted to speak to them again. That it wasn't their decision to make and they should have called and told me the situation so I could at the very least say good bye and be with him. That by failing to tell me, they stole an opportunity for any closure I could have. I raised that cat from a feral kitten with his mother and his brother from the time he had his eye's open. He was only 10.

I'm equally heart broken and furious and they can't seem to understand why. They proceeded to berate and belittle me, going as far as to say I wasn't sad, just angry and that I was: ""ruining a beautiful and tragic moment"" and that it was my fault because I didn't go with them. Edit: As just to be clear the never wanting to see them again bit was after this attempt to make me feel bad for being angry.

Am I the asshole here?

AITA for letting my nephew to call me mom?,"Awhile back, my brother married a woman who had an 11 year old son named ""Billy"". A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.

I asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.

When he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said ""To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance."" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.

My SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?

Edited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. 

Also, I just want to thank everyone who left such sweet comments. I've been so choked up reading them all.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my stepdaughter she’s absolutely under no circumstances allowed to switch out my cats food for vegan food even though she’s losing weight because the sight of normal cat food makes her sick?,"Sorry for the appalling title. My stepdaughter is living with my husband and I for the next year. Shes an educated young professional who’s saving up to buy her own home. 

Since she’s moved in with us (past 3 months) she’s become increasingly snappy and unhappy with how her dad and I run our lives. We aren’t environmentally conscious enough because we don’t compost our waste, we are negligent because we leave lights on when we leave our home for security reasons, we should switch to electric cars, we are contributing to the inhumane treatment of cows by consuming dairy, the list is endless. 

My cat Mango is getting to be an old ass man and he has lived a full life of eating whatever the fuck he likes (obviously within what’s safe for a cat) and hes happy that way. My stepdaughter is now insisting she will purchase vegan cat food because seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick. 

We feed him in the kitchen and she will literally throw up / retch/ leave the kitchen if she sees him eat meat. She HAS lost a lot of weight since claiming that seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick, and we leave out dry biscuits for him to snack on which also makes her sick. It’s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that’s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. 

Her dad and I both told her if she’s unhappy with it she needs to find someplace else to live and although we are genuinely sorry she’s lost her appetite and has lost weight we aren’t going to change Mangos lifestyle- she has yelled, cursed at us, cried, begged, etc, but no, we are NOT happy with Mango eating a vegan diet. We don’t feed him cheap crap either, we feed him food quality cat food that isn’t processed or full of sugar or grain. It’s pretty much gourmet Gordon Ramsey worthy cat food. 

My MIL has waded in after my stepdaughter told her we were being unfair by refusing to let Mango go on her preferred diet for him, and is accusing us of being cruel and shortsighted. She says we are letting her get sick, and that Mango won’t hurt from a change in diet but stepdaughter is hurting.",Not the A-hole
AITA for pushing off a girl my lap and making her cry?,"I \[19M\] just started dating a girl I really, really like a couple months ago. I was hanging out with my friend (I'll call Joe\] who is also 19, and has a crush on this girl ""Sarah"" \[18F\]. Anyway, we were all hanging out and there were no more seats in the car, so I suggested she sit on Joe's lap, but she chose to sit on mine, so I put a jacket on my lap so she wasn't directly on me. I felt really uncomfortable because she's just sitting her bony ass on me and I have a girlfriend, who she knows I have.

Anyway, when we stopped to get gas I made her sit on my friend's lap instead and she started to full on cry because I didn't want her to sit on me and I had put a jacket. I felt awkward and bad for my friend who likes her and she was just crying on his lap and said I was a jerk.

She ended up texting me saying we have to talk about us and I said, ""what are you talking about 'us?'"" and she said that I was giving her mixed signals because she thought there was something between us. I said nope, I'm like this with all my friends, and she said I thought you were like that with Joe as a joke because he's just your friend but me it's because you liked me, and that it made her confused because she knows I have a girlfriend. I said ""nope, I'm like that with everyone"" and told her I'm happy with my girlfriend and I don't want to date her. She called me an asshole and I haven't seen her since. Her best friend texted me and said I was being an asshole. I told my girlfriend \[19F\] against my friends wishes (who are also her friends, not Sarah, but Joe is) and she laughed and said that boys are so oblivious and that she could tell Sarah had a crush on me but she trusted me to make the right choices. Basically, she didn't really care, just thought Sarah was kind of crappy for trying to go after a guy with a girlfriend.

So, AITA? I legit didn't really know she had a crush on me. It kind of dawned on me that night. I never pursued her. I slept over her house once because I was too drunk to drive but I slept on the floor and didn't let her near me, and I would mention my girlfriend a lot because I'm excited about dating her. Apparently she thought I liked her because she once asked me if I would join her art club and I said sure. I don't understand girls. I really don't.

&#x200B;

Update: Wow, THIS BLEW UP! Sarah and Joe ended up hanging out on their own, apparently, and she ended up trashing me, saying I was an asshole, how she liked me, etc. Joe told me privately that he knew she had a crush on me but wanted to see what I would do/enjoy the show because he thought the drama was funny. She ended up texting me again and saying how I was a jerk and basically the friendship imploded. The last thing she said was that she wasn't sorry and I said ""well I can be sorry for the both of us."" Joe still has a crush on her and I'm sure he's still trying to date her. But, that's pretty much it for that. My girlfriend loves all the comments calling her a keeper and has found the entire situation hilarious. She really is a keeper. Thanks, everyone! ",Not the A-hole
AITA for putting bacon on my lunch to keep my Muslim friend from stealing it,"I’m not a super healthy person. At school for lunch, I usually get cheese fries. I know, very unhealthy. But one of my friends sure likes to steal my fries, as well as food from our other friends at the table. He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot; it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger.

"AITA for telling my mother that my step dad will not be walking me down the aisle because I hate him, and in turn ripping my family apart?"," 

I (23) am getting married to my boyfriend of 6 years in June. We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.

My mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.

So, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.

He's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for giving my child a ""culturally inappropriate"" name?","I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. 

Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like ""What kinda name is Dimitri?"", or ""You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name."" 

It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of ""You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.""

So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?,"I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.

This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.

I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

So, AITA?

EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",Asshole
AITA for threatening to financially cut off my son over a baby name?,"I had my son fairly young and I recently had a change of life baby. When I was four months pregnant my son, who was in college at the time told me that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. I wasn't very happy but I've been supportive and I've given them a lot of financial assistance.

I had my daughter two months ago and named her Clara. My son's girlfriend went ballistic. She said they were going to name their daughter Clara and that I should have consulted with them (umm I got pregnant first, but whatever) I told her she needs to grow up and that she doesn't own the name. My son asked me if I would consider changing Clara's name. I said no and he stormed out of the house.

Well they told me the other day they are going to name their daughter Paxtyn. I guess I made a face and she started yelling at me that it is my fault, because I stole the only name she likes. I even asked her if she likes the name Paxtyn and she said she is going to like it when I have to tell my friends I have a granddaughter named Paxtyn. So she pretty much said she hates me more than she loves her daughter.

My son said I have two months to fix this (change Clara's name) and I told them that they are both idiots, and I feel bad for their future child. I also said if they name their daughter Paxtyn just to be spiteful I will not give them any further assistance. My son called me up and said I was being controlling, but when I asked him if he actually likes the name he hung up

Edit: They never mentioned the name Clara to me

"AITA for supporting my wife after my daughter publicly exposed her diary which had ""cruel"" comments?","I have been remarried for a year now to my wife. I have a 15 year old daughter and a 11 year old son from my first marriage. I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.

My wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.

And although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.

A few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.

My daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.

My wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.

She also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.

And the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.

I admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.

But this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.

My daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.

My wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.

I disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.

I'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house. My son is following her lead. My wife has already apologized several times.

My ex has said she will be starting the process to reduce my custody and sue for defamation. I know she won't win the defamation case but I feel like custody will indeed switch. I'm very stressed out.

My daughter refused to take down the diary pages and insists she's in the right.

AITA for cutting off my family over my mom's will?,"I always suspected my mom preferred my sister over me.  Growing up, she spoiled my sister with whatever she wanted and took her word over mine whenever we argued.  I was always in second place compared to her.  For example, when we turned sixteen, I was given my aunt's old clunker that ended up dying within six months.  When my sister turned sixteen, she got the brand new red Volkswagon of her dreams.  Mom said that I couldn't continue my piano lessons because they were getting so expensive while still supporting my sister's dance lessons, competions, etc.  

Things got really bad about a decade ago.  When we were in high school, I feel in love with this guy, Joey, and started dating him for a while.  Only to for him to dump me because he preferred my sister.  Yes, my sister seduced him.  This really broke me because he was my first love.  

Well, my sister and Joey ended up getting married after their college graduation.  And that is when things went from bad to worse.  Our mother had her will made and she was leaving everything to my sister.

For background information, our childhood home was a two story building, where my mother's flower shop was on the ground floor and the apartment we grew up in was the second floor.  While I didn't get along with my mom or sister, I loved that flower shop and had been working there for most of my life.  I dreamed of owning that shop one day.

But instead, my mother was going to leave the building, the shop and the apartment, to my sister.  While I could still work in the shop, my sister would be the owner and I would have to do what she says.  There was no use in trying to convince her to change her mind.  In her mind, my sister was the married one with a baby on the way.  She needed the business and house to raise her family.  Meanwhile, I was single and had nothing.

So, I cut them off.  If my mother didn't see me as a family member, then I wanted nothing to do with them anymore.  It was clear who she favored more.  So I moved out of my childhood home and was on my own.  Less than a year later, I joined the Peace Corps and have been living abroad since.

Now, to the present.  After not hearing from them for years, my sister found me on social media and reached out to me.  She wanted to talk to me, rekindle whatever relationship we had.  I told her no, that I never wanted to talk to her or have anything to do with her or our mother again.  She then starts to write this angry message about how I could do this to her and why would I turn my back on her.

But as far as I am concerned,  she is not my family.  She hasn't been family in a decade.  My partner and our baby is family.  I have a new, happier, more fulfilling life in South Africa than I ever did back in the States.  I don't want to ever see my old family again because of how they treated me.  I don't want them to meet my daughter.  If I let them back into my life, I am afraid they will ruin the new life I made for myself.

AITA for refusing to lie to my mother's husband about how I met my husband?,"My mother and I have never gotten along. She's very serious, overachiever, type A and I've always clashed with people like that. She is also pretty self righteous about things like pride, and work ethic, and she just isn't my type of person. I feel bad because I'm her only child and I really wish she had a daughter she could actually enjoy.

My mom wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, because that's what her friends kids were doing, but I rebelled pretty hard against school. I left home the day I turned 18 and got by through modeling, working at clubs with a fake ID, and dating rich men. She always said I would understand her disappointment when I had daughters, but I have two and I cant imagine being ashamed of something so petty.

I met my husband when I was working as a yacht girl. That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care. I met my husband. he scandalized his entire family by marrying one of *those* girls and we've been very happy for eighteen years. I do have an easy life and I'm not going to lie and say it has nothing to do with looks, but they were my looks to do whatever i want with.

My mom doesn't like my husband. She thinks we both partied too much and she was hoping I'd grow up and do something ""respectable"" one day. She hates that he enables me to have the life she didn't want me to have. Well i met her new husband the other day. He works in finance, nice enough guy, but very straitlaced. He asked how i met my husband and I told him, the true story.

AITA for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?,"My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn’t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn’t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn’t want to do it.

After the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn’t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying “I don’t want to,” but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.

Things got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.

The conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn’t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I’ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we’re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.

So I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can’t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife’s parents, her sister, and my mom.

A lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for refusing to give ""back"" a gift that my boyfriend's daughter (13) had already refused to accept?","My boyfriend (37M) has two daughters. A 10 year old and a 13 year old. We've been dating for about 3 years now. I get along well with the younger daughter and she and I'm kind of like a big sister/auntie to her. The older daughter does not like me and makes it clear that she would rather her father not date me (or anyone else from what I gather). 

Boyfriend and his ex share custody and this year, since my boyfriend had them for Christmas, I got them both presents (got them both necklaces). 10 year old was very excited and happy with her gift. 13 year old got huffy and said she didn't want anything from me and refused to ""accept"" the gift. 10 year old also opened 13 year old's gift after she refused to accept it and I could tell that she did like what I'd got her. I decided to keep it for myself. 


Fast forward to today, 13 year old calls and she wants the necklace. She didn't apologise for her rude behaviour from before or anything (which I honestly don't care too much about). She asked me to give it to her since it's ""hers"" and ""you already bought it"". I told her that it wasn't hers since she refused to accept the gift and that I'm not going to give it ""back"" to her. She got upset and complained to my boyfriend who told her it was up to me whether or not I wanted to give her the gift anymore. 

Am I being too harsh on her? My sister thinks I'm just making my own life more difficult by not just giving it to her. Is it petty of me? AITA for refusing to give a gift that I did buy for her?

**Edit: ok, I did not expect this post to get so much attention. Just to clarify a few things that are being asked, I'm 27. No, this is not the first time I've got them gifts. I didn't write down my thought process properly; I've got them gifts before but they were ""experiences"" based gifts (for an example passes to amusement parks etc). This year because I was actually spending the day with them, I wanted to give a ""proper"" gift that they can actually keep and immediately ""have"" if that makes sense. And yes I kept it for myself, what else am I supposed to do with a rejected gift?** 

**Anyway..I realise that I did not handle this in the best way. I'll be seeing her today and explaining to her how I felt and why  didn't want to give it to her again and explain that perhaps we both could learn to appreciate the sentiment behind gifts better.I think I will decide what to do with the actual gift after having a proper conversation with her and seeing how that goes (especially since I already exchanged the necklace for a different one and no longer have the original one I got for her). Thanks for all the ideas as to how to approach her and this conversation. And yes I understand that she is still dealing with her parents breaking up and I feel for her, I really do.**",Not the A-hole
"WIBTA if I quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? I would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. Ex wife as well.","So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she’s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. 

For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and “yeah yeahed” me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

I’ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I’m hired. I talked to my partner and he’d gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

Kids would be cut off. I wouldn’t be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they’d have to grow up and fast.

AITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?,"My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.

The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.

Was I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking girlfriend out after she deleted dead wife’s pictures from my phone?,"My (25m) wife died 19 months ago. It was real hard on my the first few months but finally started putting myself back out there. I met girlfriend (23F) 7 months ago. It was going pretty well and she moved into my apartment around 4ish months ago. In hindsight we probably rushed this.

My girlfriend is very overprotective and clingy and scared of me cheating as she’s been hurt in the past. I let her have my phone password so she could ease her mind. She saw a photo of me and wife and asked who she was and I explained. She seemed to take it well but was a little bit awkward about it.

Fast forward 3 days and I go to take a shower and leave my phone on charge in the bedroom. I come out to see my phone unlocked. Weird but I let it slide. Later in that day I go through my photos to upload a new profile picture to Facebook. All the photos of my wife and me and her together are gone without a trace. I check my Snapchat my eyes only because I had a few in there along with intimate photos of us together. I knew it was my girlfriend.

I confronted her about it and she started yelling. She said I need to get over it and get rid of all the reminders of my wife because she was here now. She also called me really creepy for “having nude pictures of a dead girl”. (Granted i probably should have deleted those a long time ago but I didn’t want to because they were special to me, might be AH on my part there). I was livid. I told her to get out. She stared at me in disbelief as I told her again. She packed some stuff and left. I went to my room and cried. I woke up to many missed calls and angry texts from her and her friends for calling me the AH. This might not have been a big deal but she permanently got rid of 95% of the pictures of my wife. I still have some printed like the wedding and some vacations, but I’m still missing a big chunk of them. I feel like she deleted a part of me as well. I’ve had to block multiple numbers (including my sisters, wtf). I do miss her though and want to talk but I’m confused. Reddit, am I in the wrong?

Edit: Spelling

Edit 2: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support. I’m taking your advice and kicking her out of my life for good. I’m also going to my local tech store later as they said there might be a way to recover my photos. I love you all !",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my inheritance?,"My grandpa passed away a few months ago and I inherited a little over $4 million from his estate. I had no idea he had that much money and was honestly not expecting to receive anything, as I assumed it would all go to my mom. 

After I got over the initial shock, I took the opportunity to finally quit my job (which I really hated), as I don’t have any outstanding debts and can easily live off of $40,000 a year. I’m pretty introverted and am more than happy to stay at home working on art/music/other interests and gaming.

Ever since I inherited the money, my boyfriend has been pressuring me to cover all of the rent and utilities (about $1200 a month) for our apartment and start putting money away into a joint savings fund. I would be happy to do this if we were married, but we’re not. We’ve only been dating for a year and a half, and I would prefer to keep our finances separate. Despite not working anymore, I still pay my half of the rent every month and have started paying for a housekeeper to come in and clean a few times a week, so our apartment is nearly always spotless and looks great. 

I told my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my money and he said I was being selfish for expecting him to still contribute to the rent when I could easily afford to pay for the whole thing. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not telling someone I can read lips,"This happened pre COVID btw.

I've had hearing loss for most of my life , but it was diagnosed when I was about 7 years old. So I learned to read lips at the same time I was learning to speak. I'm very proficient in reading lips.

Whenever I work with someone new, I make sure to let them know that I have hearing loss and to make sure that they are facing me and I'm aware they're talkin to me.

I've never actually mentioned to any co-workers that I could read lips & but I'm pretty sure most of them at least suspect it strongly.

A new co-worker started and I did my customary introduction and disclaimer about my hearing. 

I don't think she believed me because she got very offended when I ignored her. The problem being she was trying to get my attention from behind me and I genuinely did not hear her. Once someone got my attention I apologize to her and pointed out that I did have hearing loss and I wasn't aware that she was talking to me.

A few days later she was venting to a mutual coworker. The only problem was she was facing me and I could read her lips perfectly. 

After a few minutes I approached her and let her know that if she was going to s*** talk someone she needed to make sure they couldn't understand her and that I was reading her lips the entire time.

I told her I was upset that she wouldn't just come to me, and that I did tell her twice that I was partially deaf and couldn't hear her. She freaked out because apparently I was being rude by reading her lips when she was facing me",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I played “Another One Bites the Dust” at my brother’s wake?,"My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost one of my limbs. Maybe it’s stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn’t Catholic and wouldn’t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn’t know there. He’d think it’s way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while “It’s Raining Men” played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like “Highway to Hell” and “Another One Bites the Dust.” 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play “Another One Bites the Dust” at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren’t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I’ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

WIBTA?

Edit: I didn’t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don’t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn’t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother’ s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we’re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

AITA for not telling my fiancée about a secret room in our apartment?,"I recognize the title sounds a little ridiculous. The situation is less so.

I was very fortunate to be in a position to buy an apartment straight out of college. It's a weird unit on a high floor of a weird building, but I've gut-renovated it and made it really nice.

One aspect of my home was created just to fulfill a childhood fantasy. A secret room! It's simple— a flush mount bookcase put in the doorway. It leads to what would otherwise be a windowless very large closet or a very small room.

I made it into a cute secret lair / reading nook, but with no windows... it never got used. Ended up being more long-term storage.

I never told anyone about it... because it was a secret room!

I kind of figured at one point I'd tell my girlfriend, Emma, but I didn't want to tell her until I had a *reason* to. (I had finished it shortly before meeting her.)

I figured maybe one day if we had a kid, I could remove the bookcase and bam, we'd have plenty of space to put in a changing table setup. Or a craft-nook for her.

But I largely forgot about it, except when I needed to pull something out from back there... which is rare.

**Fast forward to yesterday.**

Emma, now my fiancée, has been living with me in my (now our!) apartment for eight months.

During this time, I've kept the secret room... *a secret.*

It's not like I was thinking about it all the time. I only consciously did something sneaky maybe three times since she's moved in, to get christmas lights, a spare coffee maker, and to put away a novelty item she probably thought I threw out.

And the reason I was sneaky at those times was because again, I didn't want to waste the surprise on christmas lights!

We've both been working from home lately, and we aren't really able to leave very often, due to circumstances... And she jokingly announced we needed a new room to shake things up from her normal commute. (Bedroom to Living Room.)

So ***of course*** I excitedly pulled open our ""built-in"" bookshelf and showed her our room!

***...And she flipped out.***

She is furious at me. She sees me keeping this secret as a major betrayal of trust, given that this is her home. She's acting like I cheated on her. I tried to explain I was waiting for a special moment, but... she thinks that makes it worse.

AITA for disowning my brother for abandoning a girl after getting her pregnant?,"Throw away because some of my friends know my reddit account and I want to keep this as private as possible. Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.

I am f25, my brother is m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant. I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed because he never asked if he could have people over (""Im an adult OP, I can do what I want""). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a ""bullet dodged"" party. 

He had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*. Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking birth control, because ""Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on the pill."" ….. right. 

I was livid. I was completely disgusted not only by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words ""pack your shit and get the fuck out"" Obviously more than this has happened in the past, but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, ""all of you get the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.""

Here's where I'm possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper. I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police. Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several* messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.

so reddit, am I the asshole?

EDIT: so I didn’t think this would get as much traction. I’ve already seen some comments about it, and gotten some PMs, so Im gonna address this now. I only posted this to find out if I was TA for *how I handled it*. If I am TA, fine. So be it. But I don’t care what your views on abortion are, or how you don’t think he’s responsible for her pregnancy. So please do not comment if you’re just going to tell me about how abortion is sinful.

I informed that that sex isn't actually harmful to the baby at all and actually provides some health benefits to the mother. And you drinking alcohol is far more harmful, she got angry at me and said that men don't know anything about pregnancy and said she's sick of know it all men who know nothing about women's bodies.

"AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?","My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.

She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my daughter [26F] that I [55M] will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad [50M].,"My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it.

AITA for not paying for the extra meal I accidentally ordered at a wedding?,"My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff.

Well soon after people started moving in to the houses I noticed people basically used my little road to access the main road nearby and kids used my field to play football, I was pretty much okay with it because it wasn't bothering me or inconveniencing me.

Untill a few months later that was, basically whenever people had a party or a gathering I noticed my road and the field which they drove over was full of cars and a few weeks later some people started straight up using it as a parking area. I had multiple talks with multiple people and the results ranged from apologetic people moving their cars to aggressive people who told me to go F myself.

I finally had enough and started getting cars towed which led to people yelling at my girlfriend in particular, as such I build a large stone fence around my entire property.

Well multiple neighbors including the aggressive ones were all apologetic and asked me to remove the fence and how sorry they were for using it as they basically had to add 15 to 20 minutes to their travel time to work without my shortcut, I told them to go F themselves and to get the F of my property and if I saw them there again I'd be letting my dogs loose.

However this is also impacting the nice neighbors so I am conflicted.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?,"Context: So a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called “Jan”. I am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. I’m a tall and lanky male at 6’1 and 155lbs. Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


Recently, we had a watch party at Jan’s apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said “I sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny.” 

Jan has a huge crush on Dylan and didn’t appreciate that I called him skinny. 

This caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying “what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you’re literally built of twigs?” “You would die playing football. Tbh I don’t think you could even lift a helmet!” 

At first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.

“Look at you, you’re like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials”  (I’m brown but not African)
“That’s why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you. You look malnourished”

She kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn’t even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.

Her: “Go lift some weights. It’s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.”

Me: “If you could tell me what your current diet is, I’m sure I’ll put on weight in no time.”

*silence*

Her: “What are you trying to say?”

Me: “I’m saying that if I’m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I’m pretty certain you wouldn’t win.”

Her: “No wonder [ex] didn’t want you. Go fuck yourself.”

Me: “And no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.”

At this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

Since this was at Jan’s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan’s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn’t feel that way and I don’t want to apologize.

AITA fot kicking out my daughter after she tried to send my cat to the shelter?,"Throw away for obvious reasons. TLDR at the end.

&#x200B;

the relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.

&#x200B;

so yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that ""Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.""

&#x200B;

I told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.

&#x200B;

So here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.

&#x200B;

My wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.

AITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?

TLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?

Edit to add:

As many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.

AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

AITA for leaving a repairman a bad review for flirting with my wife?,"The air conditioner broke last week while I was out of town and my wife had to call an emergency technician in the middle of the night. 

A company we’d used before without issues sent a guy over. He fixed the air conditioner no problem, but once he’d left I woke up to a million missed texts and calls from my wife, who was hysterical. 

Apparently within minutes of showing up he made comments about her body and other suggestive statements. She made it clear she wasn’t interested without being outright rude because she didn’t want him to get mad and leave without fixing the air conditioner. 

The tech kept trying to put moves on her, then after he’d fixed the A/C, he didn’t leave right away, trying to feed her some lines about how she seemed to be home alone and he could “spend the night to make sure she was safe.” 

Eventually he realized he was driving down a dead end and left, but the whole thing just really freaked her out, having some guy in the house who didn’t leave when asked and everything. 

I was pissed to hear about all this, and she was shaken up by the incident, so we left a review on their Google and Yelp pages saying what had happened. 

The company is pretty small so the owner called me to apologize a couple days later and said the tech had had a few drinks that night, not expecting to be called out to an emergency job, and that “his sense of humor had clearly been misinterpreted” by my wife. 

He asked me to take my review down because it called the tech out by first name and apparently a review saying he was coming onto a female customer could cause some personal problems for the guy. 

The owner also reasoned that the business was an air conditioner repair business, not a bedside manner business, and that they did fix the air conditioner, so deserved a higher rating. 

I told them our review stands, and they basically said we were assholes for threatening the reputation of their business and the personal reputation of the tech over a single misunderstanding. 

On the one hand, they did fix the air conditioner, and that’s what we called them to do. On the other hand, I feel like this is relevant information for people considering hiring them, even if it was a one time thing.

AITA for telling my family to stop celebrating?,"6 years ago I met the best person in the world. She was a sweet old lady that moved in next door, named Maggie. Maggie taught me how to knit, we watch Mamas family together, i helped her give her cat her medicine, I helped water her plants when she got to frail to do it herself. She knitted me a hat for every holiday., I helped her install WiFi. Maggie was a nurse in WWII.

Maggie passed away 3 months ago at the age of 94. She went peacefully in her sleep, and it is the heartbreak of my life. About two weeks after she died, I noticed a man walking into Maggie’s house. Maggie didn’t have any family except for a nephew, who lived across the country. I went up to him and asked who he was, and he said he was going to clean out his aunts things.

That was the end of that until yesterday. Maggie’s nephew had rung my doorbell, and had told me that Maggie left me most everything she had in her will. Maggie left me 1 million dollars in a account I can open when I turn 18, most of her personal effects, and her cat, blue. Who I rescued two days after she died and kept. She wrote me and her nephew letters. she said some stuff I would rather not share. It tore me up about Maggie even more. She was such a gentle soul and she deserved better. 

I started crying, and I told my parents. They started celebrating about  it immediately. I asked them to stop. And they did, until today they presented me with a cake, that said “hey, you get to go to college!”. To say that it made me upset is a understatement. I get that Maggie’s money is a life changing thing, but I would much rather have Maggie. 

I told them to stop celebrating then I went to my room to hold blue and cry. My brother knocked on my door and told me I was being a asshole because our parents are just happy for me.

"AITA - I missed my daughter’s award ceremony because of my son, she’s still not speaking to me","This might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

I’ve been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He’s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He’s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it’s helped somewhat.

Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son’s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. 

Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn’t leave, and he wasn’t calm for hours. I’d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn’t going to be able to make it. 

She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I’d missed every game and performance she’d had as a child and it clearly wasn’t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can’t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I’ve barely spoken with her since. She didn’t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn’t shown up for holidays and I’ve heard she’s engaged but didn’t call to tell me. She’s cut us out, and in the one of three times we’ve spoken since she said it’s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn’t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. 

AITA - I’ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn’t a perfect mom growing up - I didn’t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I’m heartbroken but I don’t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to give my parents money?,"I’m a 19 year old F with six older siblings. My parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn’t have on my siblings, so by the time I hit my teenage years, I realized I was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when I turn 18. I started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when I was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. 


By the time I was 16, I was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. When my parents told me they couldn’t pay for college, I’d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. I’ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. 


The issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29F) got married. My parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. To make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. They’d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn’t get out of. 


Two weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. She didn’t say hi, ask how I was, or make any small talk. She just said “Your dad and I need a favor. When can we call you?” 


I’d expected this. None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they’ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. I figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. 


I was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I’d made from the ages of 14-18. 


The exact statement my mom had made was “You made that money under our roof. We were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...We bought you food and clothes for 18 years. That money is only a fraction of what you owe us...” and so on.


I said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it’s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, I didn’t ask for any of it, etc. They responded by telling me that if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t have the life I have today. I said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. 


Since that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is “rightfully theirs.” My siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it’s my job as their kid to take care of them. I told them they wouldn’t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.


I’m torn. I feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. I feel I shouldn’t be responsible for fixing their mess. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for cutting off my hearing so I don’t have to listen to a family member.,"I (15F) am deaf in both ears after getting meningitis as a toddler. Luckily my parents really pushed intervention, so I can read lips, know sign language and have cochlear implants, so I’m basically like any other girl my age. I just can’t hear for shit.

My aunt (40) has been staying with my family-that’s me, my mom, my dad and my 13 year old sister- during quarantine. She is REALLY not someone I like. She critiques every little thing my sister and I do, tells us we need to eat more (or less, depending on the day, even though we’re skinny), butts in to our personal conversation and just is snoopy in general. She tries to instigate fights between us- like asking my sister if she’s mad I have something she doesn’t. It’s also important to know she’s done nothing to learn about communicating with me. I’d say about 90% of the rest of my extended family knows sign language. We’ve told our parents about it a million times, and they’ve talked to her. I don’t think they’ve given her an ultimatum, so my sister and I devised a plan. 

For the past few days whenever my aunt starts talking, I just detach my hearing aids and my sister puts in her airpods and turns up the volume. We can understand each other fine. My aunt didn’t get it the first couple of times but I think today she understood we were ignoring her and got really upset. She told my dad, and from what I understand, he basically told her she needs to lay off if she’s bothering us that bad or she can leave. I was happy to hear that, tbhz 

I heard (lol) her crying later though, and that made me feel like *shit*. I never meant to make someone cry and now I kinda regret the whole thing. Are my sister and I assholes for going to such extreme measures? We just wanted her to leave us alone, or at least be nice to us.

EDIT: Wow I went to sleep and look what I woke up too! Thanks for all the nice comments and stuff! Here’s a few things I wanted to point out.

I have good hearing with the implants in. Without them in,  I will only hear some thing VERY loud right next to my ear (like if someone claps into it). Doctors typically rate it on a scale- I am severely deaf. Cochlear implants have two parts- external and internal. The external connects to the internal with a magnet. It comes off like you would take off a magnet on your fridge. I CAN switch it off, but I thought the message would get across better if I yanked it off my head. 

I wish I could answer everyone who’s PM’d me or left comments about the implants. I think unfortunately that’s something for your doctor- everyone is different. 

I agree aunt doesn’t need to learn sign language. However- because I was in early intervention and then speech therapy for most of my childhood, I have a more “normal” speaking voice and so she says I should talk. It’s a bit nasally sounding to me and I prefer to sign. Aunt likes to move out of my line of sight and that forces me to speak and makes me feel bad. 

Also, yes my little sister is amazing. Thanks for all the nice comments about her. She’s my best friend and I love her so much. 

We decided to be nice to aunt today and see what happens.

AITA for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face,"My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?,"I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. 

Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

"WIBTA if I told my family that our ""secret family recipe"" came from the side of a can?","Growing up every year around the holidays my mom would make fudge. The story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. 

In my late teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never once needed to write the recipe down. 

It came out that I had the recipe early and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. 

Tonight I was reading an article about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe. 

After not much googling at all I found ""our"" exact recipe on the website for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on cans over the years. 

This leads me to believe that either my grandma or her mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin. 

I think this is hilarious and want to share the information. We've been so secretive about a recipe that's in public domain!  There's really no reason to hoard it anymore.

AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?,"My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’

AITA for telling a friend's bf her intentions of getting pregnant?,"A couple years ago, a close friend, Ashley, started a long-distance relationship with a guy, Chris. He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.

&#x200B;

The issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.

For context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.

&#x200B;

To me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, ""one way or another"", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.

&#x200B;

Before her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.

&#x200B;

A few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.

&#x200B;

As you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.

&#x200B;

At that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out. Now, Ashley hates me because she was kicked out after a huge move and didn't have a job or money to make it back. She said I'm a terrible person for putting her and her kids out on the street.

AITA for disinviting my brother to my wedding after he told me “being gay is wrong”?,"Little backstory: I’ve been out of the closet since I was 17, in 2007. When I came out, people in my family said some pretty hurtful things, which I totally expected, being from a southern Baptist family in... god, it hurts to admit this but.. Florida😫. But my older brother at the time seemed very receptive, surprisingly. He told me that if my Dad ever gave me any trouble, to call him and he’d talk to him. That was really the last time we talked about it. 

Flash forward 13 years (I’m 30) and I’m getting married to my fiancé Scott next year in April (if covid so graciously allows). I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I’s childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he’s wanted to “talk to me about this for a long time”

He went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn’t “what god wants”. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn’t think it’s right that we’re getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won’t be coming to the wedding because he didn’t “want to have to explain to her what was going on here”.

Notice he only said that SHE wasn’t coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad’s side of the family feels the same way they do, but I’ve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. 

I think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they’re close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn’t be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they’ve never been anything less than loving and supportive. 

I told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we’re doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren’t born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.

Edit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between “youre the asshole, he’s family. Invite him” and “he’s the asshole, fuck him. Don’t invite him”. I’m a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn’t sure I could see where that could fit here on my own.

AITA for being cold to my ex-fiancé and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?,"So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.

I knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

These past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.

Suffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.

I've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to ""Reconcile"" i've shut it down,

My friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my to be granddaughter in law some lewd advice after my family asked for some ‘grandmotherly wisdom’?,"My good friend Gracie made me aware a few weeks ago of a phrase that made both of us laugh til we were sore, a dirty phrase which is ‘the key to a successful marriage is to keep a mans stomach full and balls empty’. 

Both of us are in our 70’s and jovial and sprightly if I may say so. I liked the phrase – it was funny, and it stuck around in my mind. My family are aware I have a filthy sense of humor and I do like to laugh. 

My eldest grandson is in his 30’s and recently proposed to his fiancée, they made us aware over it via a family FaceTime session. It was very sweet and everyone was in good spirits, drinking, etc. 

My granddaughter and daughter pushed me to say a few words in the way of advice, but frankly I wouldn’t know, and I’m not one to give advice anyway. my grandsons fiancée said no no, give us some wisdom! So I said the phrase and the only people who burst out laughing were my grandson and his fiancée. 

Everyone else looked mortified and my granddaughter immediately started berating me. I told my friends this and they think it wasn’t a big deal but my granddaughter and daughter have texted to say I was inappropriate and ruined a moment.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?,"Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

That was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200B;

Now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200B;

He thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.

&#x200B;

Edit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",Not the A-hole
AITA for shutting down talk about having kids with “purposely controversial statements?”,"   
Our region has done well handling COVID, so my husband and I had a small group of family over for a backyard BBQ a month ago.

We’re the only ones in the family “left” who don’t have kids. We’re not going to. We prefer our lives as mountaineers. His family thinks we'll change our minds. Mind you, husband had the snip.

MIL jokingly mentioned that maybe with all the “alone time” we’d be giving the family a little bundle of joy. We shut the idea down with good humor. She kept pressing, and SIL chimed in with “Come on, this is the perfect time to get started!”

Husband: We’ve talked about this already. Let’s drop it.

MIL: Well, I don’t care. 

Husband: Again, drop it.

MIL: I hope it happens!

Husband: Thankfully we’re very careful.

MIL: Accidents happen. It isn’t always up to you.

Husband: Yes, it is. I had a vasectomy. Like I said, discussion over. Can we move on?

We do, but MIL and SIL are whispering with each other and shooting glances, looking at their phones, etc. BIL and I are laughing about something dumb on TV, seems like everything is fine.

Until SIL says, “Vasectomies can fail, you know! It’s not a 100% thing.”

It gets quiet, MIL & SIL look smug.

MIL: So there’s still a chance you can get pregnant, you can NEVER be sure!

Husband & I lock eyes. Party’s over.

Me: That is exactly what abortions are for.

Cue screaming and yelling, I’m an evil, cruel bitch, what kind of monster, etc. His family are all supposedly pro-choice.

Husband yells at them to GTFO, don’t talk to me like that. MIL gets up in his face and yells that I said I would kill her grandbabies, how could he stand to hear it.

Husband: And I would hold her fucking hand the entire time because it’s what BOTH of us would want.

Party’s over. Cue FB shitstorm. MIL’s post tags us, says: “We were having a nice family get together and OP and Husband had bait us with purposely controversial statements. Every mom lives to see her babies have babies. Yesterday I was told that my cruel DIL would murder my grandbabies if she got pregnant and my son would hold her hand while she did it.”

I do not feel like we’re assholes, even for how we handled the situation. There was no getting through to them without being direct and final. This isn’t the first time we tried to get them to drop the subject. However, other family members really think we are in the wrong and that I went over the line.

AITA for burning bridges with my in-laws at my husband's funeral?,"I married ""Jake"" when we both were 19 - I know in hindsight that that was dumb, but it was common in the area. We're from an area with little in the way of opportunities, and while I did well enough to get scholarships and attend college, Jake decided to join the military. We talked extensively about this, and he was vocal in his intention to only join for one term to get the GI Bill and then get out and go to college.

When I married him, Jake was a sweet, funny guy who enjoyed cooking and the only things he'd willingly hurt were deer. 

But after he joined, Jake changed. He got a lot angrier, in general. I'd never known him to have a temper, but he went from never raising his voice to yelling at his family and me when he didn't get his way, to less pleasant behavior when he was drunk. And oh how he drank. I have nothing against a beer with friends now and then, but after joining the military Jake was drinking constantly. His sense of humor got a lot cruder, too, ""Dirty little sheet heads!"" became his favorite punchline.

The final straw was when we discussed his plans to get out and go to college since he was looking at whether to stay in or get out. He wanted to stay in. I reminded him he'd promised to get out. He'd been drinking, and things got ugly.

The wives' club at the base was no help, so I started quietly looking into how to divorce Jake. Then, earlier this year, he died in a car accident. My only feeling was, honestly, relief. I went to his funeral and didn't say anything at the service, but at dinner Jake's little sister approached me and said she'd started dating a soldier and wanted to know if I had any advice. My advice? ""Don't. The military ruined Jake and turned the man I loved into a drunk, abusive asshole.""

Jake's family predictably erupted in a firestorm, but more alarmingly to me, my own parents have taken their side.

AITA for making a fake diary entry to catch my stepmom?,"I (17F) have been quarantined with my dad and step mom. My mom is a doctor so she was super paranoid about my family living with her during the pandemic, but as things where I live are settling down she let us come stay with her again. 

My stepmom has known me for two years and our relationship has always been weird. She’s a nice person but she can be pretty mean and childish if we do something she doesn’t like. She also has a tendency to run to our dad if she hears something bad about us. 

Long story short, I have a diary and I keep a lot of private stuff in it. Dad called me a few days ago (we were visiting with our mom) saying he has to talk to me when I come back. Apparently I was in trouble because of something I apparently said to stepmom. 

When he told me what she said I said, I immediately recognized it because I wrote it in my diary. I realized a lot of the stuff I wrote down was stuff she was telling him, so I decided to come up with a plan to see if I was write. I wrote a fake entry basically saying stuff I would never do in a million years and set the trap.

Dad calls me while out visiting with friends, and when I come back he grounds me for what I “did”. Stepmom comes in later, apologized and said it sounded “concerning” and she had to tell. 

I told her it was fake, knew she read my diary and refused to speak to her. My dad came in and tried to talk to me and I told him that stepmom was reading my diary and he didn’t believe me. 

Now I’m with my mom, and I don’t know if what I did was fair. I felt it was the only way to prove my point and I didn’t know what else to do.

"AITA for refusing to sell the place I bought with ""stripper money""?","For several years I was a stripper. I have no shame about what I did, and only quit when I got a better job offer. In the time I worked as a stripper, I intentionally lived as cheaply as possible (shitty little studio flat, living off ramen, wearing old clothes) because my coworkers all told me that they were able to buy their own places on their income, so long as they saved like crazy. Before I ""retired"", I managed to outright buy myself a 3 bedroom flat. I rented out the other rooms for a while but I got sick of having roommates, so now I have them up online for shorter stays, but not to rent.

I met this guy about 18 months ago, and we've been together since. He knows about my employment history, and he said that he has no issue with it, though he did ask me to tell his family the white lie I occasionally use (on my CV and stuff), which is that I was a waitress (which I kind of was tbf).

A month ago we found out that I'm 2 months pregnant. He says this is great news, and we should move in together. I assumed he'd be moving into my place because he rents his (far smaller 1 bedroom) flat while I own mine, and I have room for a baby's room while he doesn't. Also, I really don't want to leave my flat. It's my flat, I love it, I could see myself living here for the rest of my life, and I don't want to lose the security of owning a flat and have to go back to paying rent or a mortgage each month.

However, he then said that he didn't want to move into my place, and said I should sell it and we buy a place together. I said that I like my place, it means a lot to me that I was able to buy it, and it represents years of working my arse off scrimping and saving. He then said that he understands all of that, but we should be living together by the time the baby comes and he didn't want to live in my flat. I asked him why not - it's a great flat, it's central to everything, it's spacious, it's got room for all his stuff, there's a daycare in the building (run/owned by another tenant) and a school 5 minute walk away, the list goes on - and he said that he didn't want to live in a flat that was bought with ""stripper money"".

That really pissed me off, and I told him no fucking way am I selling my flat and that he never had an issue with my ""stripper money"" paying for this flat before now. I said I wasn't giving up the security of owning a home for someone who tries to make me feel ashamed about something I don't feel ashamed of. He said that his point is if I sold the flat then we could get a new place with the money from the sale. I said ""wouldn't that still be stripper money?"" and he said ""that's different"", and I asked how. He then said he was going back to his place because ""I can't talk to you when you're in this state"".

He's gone back to his flat now and he's texted me saying I'm overreacting/irrational and I need to think of this realistically rather than emotionally. He says he wouldn't feel right raising a child in my flat knowing how I purchased it and selling/moving is the best idea of all of us, not to mention the fact he isn't on the deed because it's my place and it ""would never feel like our place"" because of this.

I feel I might be the arse because I get why he might feel like it's just my place and I feel I'm being too rigid in a time we need to work together, plus I spoke to my sister and she sided with him so 2 out of 3 people think I'm in the wrong here.

AITA?

Update on the off chance anyone sees this: I dumped him. There was a whole conversation and during the conversation he said he didn't want to be a parent if I wasn't willing to do everything he wanted, including sharing a house/deed (plus staying together). Also, at the start of the conversation I said what a few people suggested, which was that I'd be willing to sell and split the house with him, provided he paid 50%, and he got very very angry, very very quickly. He also said a few other things, so IDK how it's all going to pan out just yet, but it looks like I'm going to be a single mother.",Not the A-hole
"AITA For ""Ruining"" my kid's life after she ruined a dress?","Ex(31) and I(m32) had C, (F16) way too young. We're friendly co-parents. One big rule we share is if our daughter breaks something, she pays for it.

Now, sis (27) and I are the only grandkids. Aunt never married. Instead, she worked with Gma and Gpa at their seamstry store, and took it over when they retired.

Sis's girlfriend (29) proposed last year. Gpa offered to make FSIL a custom suit, which she was over the moon about. Gma had me ask Sis what her dream dress was and record the convo. Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper. 

Well, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fot perfectly and everyone cried. 

Sadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding. 

The issue comes in with C. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then C asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. C made a face, but dropped it. 

Later, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but C decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.

We got back, and the dress was destroyed. C had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.

Sis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded C, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. 

C has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college. 

I took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax. 

I explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt. 

C told my ex, and while she agreed C was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have ""ruined her future"" for a ""free"" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong. 

So, am I the asshole here?

Edit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. 

I pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up C's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and C is much larger then Sis. I love C as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit. 

The character count is very limiting.

Edit 2 - to clarify, the money was C's ""have fun at college"" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was askong what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.

Edit 3 - So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was ""unfair"" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got ""nothing,"" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. 

Honestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes. 

As for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. 

I have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital. 

As for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfit for her medical bills, since it was C's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make ammends. 

We'll see what the next few monthd bring.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my friend for a “boob-voyage” party?,"A while ago, my doctor found a cancerous lump in my breast. Thankfully it was stage 1, but I did end up having a mastectomy. It was a stressful time, and when my friend was over a few days before my surgery, we got on the topic of the “boob-voyage” party from Jane the virgin. I asked her if she would throw me one of those parties to help me get my mind off it. 

I thought she would put together just a small girls night, but she went all out. She invited all of my friends and my boyfriend and had an array of boob paraphernalia. It was funny and lighthearted and meant a lot to me to get all that support from my friends.

During my recovery, my boyfriend confronted me and said that he hated the boob party, he thought it was tacky, and he was offended that I hadn’t asked him to put something together instead. He said that we were supposed to be going through it together and I should have thought about his feelings and the fact that he doesn’t like parties and wouldn’t want to spend one of the nights leading up to my surgery like that. I told him that I’m sorry he felt that way, but it was really helpful for me and I was the one getting surgery and treatment. I told him I wanted to support him but my feelings had to take priority under those particular circumstances and the party helped me.

AITA for ruining jeans for women?,"I work at an office where I’m allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the “no jeans policy.” She frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

Problem is, for the past few months that I’ve been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago. 

I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

I said “Well, the girls get to wear jeans.”

“No they don’t.”

Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn’t allowed to wear jeans. 

In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn’t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

AITA?

EDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can’t say I’m surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn’t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. Thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",Asshole
"AITA for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?","Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.

She's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

If you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

That's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

Our anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again."" We ended up going out instead.

It kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

She also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse.

I just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

TL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?

Edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

Edit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

Edit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

Also, yes, I wash the dishes

#Final Edit:

Okay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess.

I really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

So her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.

She said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

I'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

So, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

AITA For telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?,"Heya. 

So this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. 

I take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background: 

 I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). 

Ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. 

Now onto the story: 

I'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. 

I look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. 

The man was stuttering and saying things like ""I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" 

I told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. 

I was then at my stop and ran home.

I felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. 

Should I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?

Edit to clear up some things: 

-I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation
-I'm a female :) 
-I live in Canada
-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse 
-If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.

AITA for not wanting my parents to adopt another teenage girl,"I (15F) live with my parents (mid-40s) and my brother (9M). It’s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with ‘Jess’ who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.

She was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my ‘sister.’ I said I didn’t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don’t I know how much she’s been through. She’s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she’s very brave - but I don’t want to live with her.

My parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn’t even here yet.

We live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don’t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’

Good to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is ‘too much effort.’

My parents are offended that I’m ‘not being welcoming’ towards my ‘sister’, and I’m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I’m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?

Update: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.

AITA for telling my girlfriend that her phobia is ridiculous and she needs treatment?,"My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.

It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.

She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. 

Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?,"I was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. At a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

As I was near, I rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

When she saw me coming near her she said “ don’t touch me I’m fine “, in a really agressive angry voice. 

I said ok, I just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied “ I dont need your help”, again super angry. 

I wasn’t the only one that got up and got closer to her, but I was the first one, cause I was sitting right by the restroom

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn’t help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said “ I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I’m good”.

I kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

They all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

Am I the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

AITA For Telling My Wife That If She Quits Her Job I Expect Her To Cover All The Housework?,"My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. 


My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?


Edit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",Not the A-hole
AITA for only going out to eat with my uncle after the rest of my family disagreed with my restaurant choice?,"I (F21) am currently living with my uncle and his family while I attend university. In my family it's tradition for everyone to invite out their family for their birthday. The person celebrating their birthday pays.

My birthday was yesterday and luckily restaurants here have already opened up. About a week in advance I chose a Moroccan couscous restaurant and made a reservation. I briefly mentioned it to the rest of the family at dinner but I don't think most of them were listening.

Two days ago I reminded everybody where we were going. Everybody except for my uncle started to complain about the choice. My extremely picky cousin (17) apparently hates Moroccan food, even though I don't think he's ever tried it. My aunt is uncomfortable with going to ""that kind"" of restaurant (?). My other cousin (26) is a vegan and didn't think he would be able to eat a lot of things, and his girlfriend didn't want to eat there because she's on a raw food diet. My other cousin is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.

It didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. They asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that I don't really like. I refused and said they just didn't have to come.

Only my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which I'm happy about because I know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. It was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. 

Now the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually include the whole family, and they think it's inconsiderate of us to have eaten without them. I think it's their fault for not even wanting to try it. AITA?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your judgements. I saw a lot of people confused about paying when it's your birthday. Where I'm from it's the custom, not just in my family but everywhere. I think it's a nice custom. That way no guest worries about not being able to pay, and it's nice to be able to pay for family and friends to have a nice meal.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my brother in law that paternity tests aren't automatic,"UPDATE: wow this got a lot of comments!!!

So I have done a LOT of snooping. And it is way more soap opera than I thought.

1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers

2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way

3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.

4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.

5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.


ORIGINAL POST

A while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.

The wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.

Well, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says ""I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!""

I thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.

The first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.

Finally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like ""you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about"" and he said it was ""the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital"" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said ""you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.""

The confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.

He got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said ""maybe it's because I have different insurance"" because that's all I could think of.

Well he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. 

Everyone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for emasculating my BF?,"I (30F) met this guy (28M) in January and he became my BF in February. Comes March, the world goes down the drain and we decided to move in together for the time of the pandemic. Everything is great.


In the morning, we have this routine where he browses Reddit and gives me the highlights. A few weeks ago, he shows me a post where this guy is challenged to an arm wrestling competition by his GF. The guy didn't seem to have any sort of training/work out whereas his GF did.


I commented he might have a surprise. My BF started educating me on biology and how men are stronger than women. I told him there were way too many factors to take into consideration to make such a broad comment. I have been doing weightlifting for 2 years and my BF has never seen a gym in his life, so I used us as an example. That was a BIG mistake.


He got really defensive and condescending, and made comments like ""That's cute."" I just let it go.


Fast forward to yesterday. He's playing some game with his friend (online) and I can clearly hear him talk about me. Well curiosity killed the cat. 


At first it's all pretty and my ego is bursting, but then he says I'm delusional because I think I'm stronger than him. Pause. ""Seriously? I know I'm weak but not weaker than a girl."" So later, I decide to call him on his BS. I asked him if he wanted to come workout with me the next day (this morning) so he can show me how strong he is. He accepted and I was happy because I had been dying to bring him and initiate him to something I'm passionate about. 


So, this morning, we went to my friend's (27M) garage (my region allows groups of 10 or less and we wipe everything). I told him we're gonna do deadlifts. It's my favorite exercise and I was already planning to test my personal best so it was perfect.


My friend was there cause he corrects my form and it's been our Sunday ritual since Covid-19. We started light and slowly worked our way up, doing the same number of reps as the other. Comes 185, his form starts to crumble so we made him go lighter. But 185 really isn't that much for me so I kept stacking the plates. He looked very supportive and impressed the whole time. I ended up beating my personal best at 265. I was ecstatic and so were they.


When we got in the car, he was very silent. I assumed he was just tired. We got home and that's when he exploded and asked me if I was proud of myself. Apparently, I humiliated him in front of my friend. I apologized. I didnt realize he was feeling that way. He got angry and said it really changed the way he saw me, like I'm less of a woman now. He stormed to the basement. 


I started collecting my things, but now I'm wondering if I should have been reading between the lines and stopped at 190 or something. Or just dropped it and never suggested we workout together? I knew very well I was stronger than him but I just had to prove it to him. AITA?


Update: I still didnt get a word of him but since some of you asked, I will make sure to update you when he does. Thank you for the overwhelming response. That was a bit of a rollercoaster day but it made it easier to know I'm not completely in the wrong.",Not the A-hole
AITA for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend’s aunt in front of everyone?,"I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
I’m a native French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced “Acadian/Chiac” accent. For those who don’t know, it’s pretty much a mix of French and English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes, where I still live. I’m perfectly bilingual in both languages.

I started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they’ve all been really great, except for one of his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn’t want to be rude to his family but it’s getting super weird. I don’t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I’m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said “a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche” which roughly translates to “to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth” when she meant “this pumpkin pie tastes delicious”) 
She constantly criticizes my “accent”.  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to “pick a language” when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper “français standard” is actually getting harder for me since I’ve been only studying/working in English). 

So last night during dinner she started going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like I didn’t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn’t trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
Turns out she was super pissed and told everyone I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might’ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?


EDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it’s hard for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain Acadian culture (she wasn’t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",Not the A-hole
AITA for buying my wife a Roomba for Christmas?,"This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.

Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.

Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.

As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family’s responsibility to clean up the house'.

Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. 

Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.

So, AITA in this situation?

EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.

EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",Asshole
WIBTA if I report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to HR for basically slut shaming me?,"I've \[F21\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. 


I went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


It came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


As I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""Dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". I looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

I was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don’t want to go after anybody’s job, but I don’t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

Will I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?

Edit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said “I appreciate your openness and honesty tho” (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said “thanks” and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn’t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. 

Also, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. 

And for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I’m having more fun than u 😘


UPDATE

Before I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you’re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so “closing my legs” or “quit being easy” doesn’t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single “whore” had one thing in common and that’s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody’s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

Now to the update: 
I called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn’t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

First and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

I explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she’s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

I then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn’t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. 

The lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she’d “call the doctor (her supervisor)” right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn’t be back in the office until next Monday. 

With all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You’ve truly been so helpful. 

And for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn’t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mom she’s a whore?,"Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I’m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

This has put a strain on my mothers and I’s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
She didn’t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I’d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn’t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. 

People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this “family friend”. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

I’ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. 

My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it’s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she’s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it’s been years, why else would you want to catch up?

My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn’t agree with it, it’s been years, he wasn’t in her life yet.

She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; 

“To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy’s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn’t ruin this one, but why don’t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?”

She cried, said she couldn’t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven’t spoken for a few days.

Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy’s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she’s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I’m not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them.,"So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200B;

Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to ""think of them"". I told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200B;

Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to Disneyland"". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200B;

I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200B;

I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",Asshole
AITA for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?,"So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.

My boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

For an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

A few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

So last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

He doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

I've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.


Edit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  I certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.

Though I haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, I'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  Whether you think I'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and I appreciate that.",Not the A-hole
AITA for charging my sister £2500 for one of my paintings after her kid ruined it?,"Backstory, I’m 26 and a fairly successful artist. My sister, “Lucy” (24) and her child “Ethan” (9) were at my house during a late New Years celebration. I had a sign posted on my art studio saying “DO NOT ENTER” and specifically made it clear to all guests that nobody was to enter that room. 
I’d also like to note that all my guests were asked to leave their kids at home as this was for ADULTS but ‘Lucy’ couldn’t do that because she couldn’t find a sitter. Anyway. 

Note : I also set up my boyfriends PS4 for him to play on so he wouldn’t be bored. 

It’s 10pm, and I hear a loud crash from my studio, I run up and see paint all over my recently work that so far had taken 15 hours to do. Ethan was sat there laughing, rubbing paint into my work, it’s now unsalvageable and I have to restart the work, as it was a specific request from a client. Which also puts me behind for the rest of my work now!! 

I immediately asked Ethan and Lucy to leave, and the next day I sent her a bill for the work. £2500 (which is LOWER than I would’ve gotten for the work anyway). 

She’s absolutely screaming about it, the whole family is divided. My mom hates me, my dad completely agrees with me. Surprise, my dad is an artist, my mum is more ‘smart smart’.  My sisters husband agrees with me. 
 
I will admittedly say, I don’t enjoy kids. Or their company. But I’ve always been a great auntie, presents at Christmas, gifts from vacation, everything he’s wanted.

AITA for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?,"BACKSTORY:

I failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. I barely passed my second one last month.I noticed I scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn’t quite what I expected it to be. (That’s ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high B)

Side Note: The class is about 60 people. Unbeknownst to me, It fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is ‘easy’. I didn’t know this. The class just fit my schedule and I certainly didn’t think it was ‘easy’ after those 2 exams.

Here’s the catch: Our professor is old and I noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. I heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score A’s and B’s. (We can’t really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). Our tests are LONG -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. 

EXAM DAY:

I was EXTREMELY irritated when I heard this. This rage really fueled me and I over-prepared for Test 3. I studied like crazy  for it because I felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. I was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. I didn’t know everything, but I felt pretty great about what I turned in.  I was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as I wrapped it up. 

Once I finished and began walking out, I looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. I was so angry and so distraught, that I used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. Of course they had. I had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  I answered ALL of them incorrectly, though I made the process look somewhat legitimate. I realized that if I answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn’t answer them in the given time (I was right). 

PRESENT DAY:

I scored a high B, and the curve put my grade at an A. 

I had the fourth-highest score on the exam.

Most students failed, even though I found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. I looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. We always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. I saw that a LOT of them (I’d estimate about 13-15 students based on what I saw ) used the ”fake” methods I had used on those incorrect answers.  More students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that I’d screwed some of the cheating students. 

I honestly can’t say I feel bad about what I did. I worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my GPA and my future. 

EDIT: 
A common argument I see here is “See you studied and did better! Just keep doing that!” 
I studied like a maniac. I didn’t go out, didn’t attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. It’s a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because I didn’t have much going on in my other classes.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?,"My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I’m mild-mannered, and they’re taking advantage - that since I’m not a tough guy or something (I’m a young woman), they don’t care. 

I’m in Australia, and I’m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

AITA for not inviting family members to my wedding?,"This goes back 3 years when my mom and her girlfriend got engaged. My mom put in so much time and energy into organizing this wedding and was so excited. She sent out invites to all our family members 4 months in advance, & almost everyone confirmed they would be going. 

Barely a week before the wedding, she received several messages from aunts and uncles who said they wont be going because they had “other commitments” despite confirming they’d be there months prior. 
One of my aunts (my grandma’s sister) confronted my mom and said many weren’t going because they still didn’t agree with the fact that she was marrying a woman, including herself because it went against her “Christian views”, meanwhile my hardcore Christian grandma was more than happy to walk my mom down the isle. 

This upset my mom but she tried not to let it ruin her wedding. I however, was furious. Only my grandma, my mom’s sister, a few cousins, and another aunt attended the wedding; while my stepmom’s entire family came.

 What really pissed me off was that 2 wks later, my cousin who lives in a totally different state celebrated her sweet 16 and everyone who made excuses about not going to my moms wedding made the journey all the way over there and posted pictures all over Facebook. It really broke my mom’s heart and just felt like salt in the wound. I swore then that when I got married, everyone who did not show up to my mom’s wedding would not be invited to mine. 

Fast forward to now , me and my girlfriend of two years got married first week of March and I kept my word. The only ones we invited to our wedding was the family that did go to my mom’s, and one other aunt who did have a good reason for not being there at the time because she was recovering from surgery. 

We even invited my stepmom’s family too. 

Obviously my other family members found out and expressed their hurt over not being invited. I called them all out and said if they had a problem with my mom for being who she is, then they had a problem with me and I wouldn’t let toxic people be apart of a special day for me and my wife.
 My wife stood behind my decision, as did my mom.  
That still doesn’t seem to stop them from thinking it was a dick move and are turning it into a whole family drama because they think it was unfair to “punish” them for simply believing in something different. AITA?

AITA for not giving my daughter a letter my deceased husband wrote for her before he died?,"In January of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was in a completely inoperable part of the brain, and was told me had six months to live. He stuck it out and died in October, three months longer than he was expected to. He was always positive, and decided a few weeks after his diagnosis that he would write letters for our daughters for significant events in their lives. My husband was my soulmate, and the past few months have been difficult knowing I’ve lost him 

We have two daughters, Mia who is 21 and Imogen (Immy) who is 19. All three of us have become a lot closer since their dads death, and we’ve all really struggled. My husband and I were together since we were children, got married when we were 18 and we were approaching our 20th wedding anniversary when he passed. 

In February of this year, Mia got married to a boy she’s been with for about 6 years. I absolutely love her husband and he’s been incredibly supportive during all of our grief. My husband wrote a letter for Mia to open on her wedding day. It’s worth noting that my daughters were unaware of these letters, it was my job to give them to our daughters. 

Her wedding day comes around and I just can’t bring myself to give her the letter. I read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. I had his handwriting and his words and it felt like he was there, and I couldn’t bare the thought of giving that up yet. I was fully intending on giving her all the other letters as the events happened. 

Last week Mia and her husband bought their first home together. They’d been living at our home since they got married, and so had a lot of stuff to pack and move to their new house. Mia asked me where her important documents were, passport, birth certificate etc, so I told her they were in my top drawer of my dresser in my bedroom. The only letter that was in there was the one I was meant to give her on her wedding day, the rest were hidden away. 

She immediately recognised his handwriting and of course it was addressed to her, so she read it and broke down. She came and found me and started screaming at me asking how I could be so selfish. I didn’t really know what to say apart from the fact that I wanted to keep it and she could take a picture of it. Both my daughters called me an asshole and are convinced I’m keeping them from a load of their dads stuff. AITA?

WIBTA for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?,"My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.

The theft: 

On Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband’s aunt & uncle’s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.

Due to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

I’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. 

I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

I mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don’t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

Also - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?,"My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.

Since then, she hasn’t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?

Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn’t she have asked??

Edit 2: and no she still hasn’t responded to me

Edit: I’m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I’m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn’t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it’s early in my time zone

Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

Also, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",Asshole
AITA for telling someone she’s the common denominator in her failed friendships?,"I’ve been with my parter for a year now and have met most of his friends. He’s very close to his friend group from high school which I think is very sweet. His best friend is getting married next year, and my bf is one of his groomsmen so we’ve been spending more time with his friend group lately. 

I’m admittedly not super keen on one of his friends (S) but I’ve always just chalked it up to personality differences. She’s quite loud and dominates conversation a lot, but it’s not like I don’t like her, I just find her a bit much. 

We were in a zoom with bfs friends, shooting shit and the wedding came up. At one point we were talking about outfits etc and S said how much she hates shopping and was dreading going shopping. She made a weird comment about how she’s so not girly and ‘one of the guys’ which I found immature, she’s a grown woman after all, but I didn’t say anything. 

S asked if I knew what I was wearing and I said no, but I had planned to go shopping with a friend of mine who also had an event coming up. I was going to ask S if she’d like to come with us, but she interrupted saying ‘Oh, that’s so cute! I just don’t like stuff like that, I don’t hang out with other girls, I just prefer being with the guys.’ Which I found really patronising to be honest. It was clear I was annoyed, and the conversation kind of took a turn.

Me: So you have never had a friendship with another woman before?

S: No I have, I just find a lot of girls petty and catty, don’t you?

Me: No I don’t. I’m friends with lots of women, we compliment each other, go shopping together and occasionally share pastries sometimes.

S: Oh I could never, girls always talk behind my back!

Me: You know, if every single relationship you’ve ever had with another woman has gone sour, there’s a common denominator there, and it’s not the fact that they’re other women, it’s probably you. 

A couple others laughed, and tried to move onto a different topic of conversation, but it was clear S was angry. She logged off early and later texted my boyfriend and said I was way out of line. He replied and told her he didn’t think so, and if she was one of the guys she should be used to a bit of gentle ribbing every now and then. 

I feel a bit bad because all though I felt hurt by her comments, she seems quite insecure to me, plus it’s not really my friendship group so I may have been a bit over bearing. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for firing my babysitter for getting drunk on the job,"This is my throwaway account. 

My (37F) babysitter (16F) has been babysitting for me for about 2 months. She’s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we’ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she’d like me to keep at the house as she’s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer’s for me and my husband, and didn’t think anything of it. 
A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn’t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. 
She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer’s. I told her to leave and she walked home. 
She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer’s were alcohol, and she hadn’t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn’t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn’t my fault she got drunk. 
My husband says I’m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn’t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go.

AITA for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a Japanese downpour?,"My friends and I went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

We’re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.

One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

AITA for refusing to let my sister and her kids move into the house that I bought?,"I'm a 32 year old woman and I just bought my first house. It has 3 bedrooms, a yard and is just what I need right now. I'm single and have 2 dogs.  My sister is 34, has 3 children and lives in a 2 bedroom apartment. Lately, she's been talking about how  such a tiny living space is not enough for the four of them.

&#x200B;

 When she got to know about the house I had bought, she became very upset and told me I was being ""wasteful"" as I'm single and don't have kids and  therefor don't need such a big space. I reminded her that what I do with my hard earned money is none  of her business. She went on to complain to our mother about how ""selfish"" I was being. Yesterday evening, I got a call from my mom telling me I should let my sister and her kids move into the house. MY house.

&#x200B;

I told her that no one was going to live in the house that I paid for but me, and that extra space would be great for my dogs to play in. My mom also got very upset with me and told me I was being unreasonable.  That my sister's kids are growing and need the space more than my dogs.  I offered to help my sister out financially  so she could rent a bigger place. My mom got my sister on the phone who shot down the idea, telling me I *needed* to let her and her kids live in my house. When I refused again, she very generously suggested a ""compromise"". I could live in the house with her and her kids and would not have to find somewhere else to live. She said this as if she was doing me a favor.

"AITA for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? My family is derisively calling me ""Scott's Tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.","Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of TV ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. 

So how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. 

My cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

I basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

That's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of ""Scott's Tots"" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

No amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

There is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. 

I have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. 

Would I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

Edit: just for my own notes since I’m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.

AITA for taking crappy holiday photos because my MIL didn't want me in the photos?,"
I married my wife Lia two months ago. I'm also a woman for the record. Lia's mom seems to have a problem with me, or my sexuality or something, Lia is bi and her mom seems to wish she'd stayed with one of her male exes.

So anyway at Christmas, we were taking photos and her mom was like ""OP, we want the photos to be family only.."" Lia started to protest, like ""we're married, mom"" but I didn't want an argument so I said ""it's ok, I'll take the pictures."" 

It was kind of cringy because lia's sister's husband, and cousin and his wife and son were there so there were definitely spouses and children included

 I was kind of annoyed and decided to not take the best ones... Just on purpose, focused the camera on the furniture rather than people, snapped pictures zoomed in awkwardly close, used unflattering flash, didn't hold my hands steady so they were blurry, took pictures on purpose when someone was looking away or coughing or something.

Anyway I took like 30 pictures and they ranged from bad to horrible. And I gave the camera back and said that I hope they find a nice one to frame in there.

After everything, Lia was angry on my behalf, said her mom had no right to treat me like that and I didn't have to say ""it's ok"" when it was totally rude. And I just started laughing and told her what I'd done. We snuck down to the dining room later that night and she lost it laughing at the pictures I'd taken. She even deleted some of the more decent ones.

We're still waiting for her mom to plug her camera into the computer and see the pictures. We're planning on saying I tried my best but didn't know how to use a dslr camera if anyone says something

"AITA lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging","Asking for blunt honesty here because I can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if I've been an asshole and if so I'll go and apologise. 

I'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

This women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

Anyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

So for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

So a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)

""Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.""

I did not say it calmly. I yelled it and was definitely angry because I'm busy organising my mother's funeral. She has gone off crying and I'm left wondering if I went too far.

AITA - for not allowing someone to propose during my wedding reception and for planning on not going to their wedding?,"Longtime lurker, first time account/posting - I’ve debated posting this for a while now, but since I’ve been so vocal the last few days on this subreddit I figured it was time to find out if I was TA instead of just commenting on others.

My wedding was September 21st, 2019. We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I’ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We’re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. 

The next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an “announcement” to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, “Nope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It’s my day. Thank you for understanding.” and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn’t happen. 

Flash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fiancé announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! 

I’m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It’s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary. Either way, regardless of the real reason, I’m still upset. Of course, my nana is super excited.

AITA for telling my boyfriend's mother she raised a fucking sociopath who needs to be in a facility.,"So I (f26) have a boyfriend (m24) and recently he got into a dispute with the neighbour's kids. They accidentally kicked their football into our yard and they came into the garden to get it back. Tbh, I didnt care but my boyfriend started screaming at these like 11 year ds about how they are poorly raised and their parents should be ashamed. I. Was. Fucking. Mortified. I sent the kids some chocolates and sweets and apologised profusely for his behaviour. 

I was seeing red flags and told him this behaviour was NOT normal. He kind of brushed me off and I told him if he pulled anything like that again he was gone. 

The next week the ball came into our garden and I was about to throw it back to the kids when my boyfriend stormed outside and took the ball inside. I told the kids that I would bring it back in a minute. He went into the bathroom and emerged like 10 minutes later wearing gloves and a football covered in shit. HIS OWN SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK.

I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind but he stormed past me and threw it over the fence screaming ""TAKE THAT YOU BITCHES"". I screamed and girl I mean screamed at him about how he was a fucking douche and I wanted him out of my house and he is a disgusting fucking monster and that they were just kids. I screamed and screamed and eventually he left.

I deleted all his games off of his ps4 and gave it to the kids as an apology. I was so embarrassed.

My ex-bf's mom messaged me asking what happened and I responded with

AITA for refusing to support my niece's lifestyle?,"My sister and her husband were sent to prison at the start of this year, and sadly won't be released for a few years. That left me to look after their 15 year old daughter Amy. I was perfectly happy to do this, but as most of their wealth was seized for being ""ill gotten"", it's meant that I've been having to care for her out of my own pocket. Once again this doesn't bother me, but it's meant massive life changes for the kid. 

Firstly, they sent her to a private school. I can't afford anywhere near those fees, so I had to transfer her to a local school. She was upset at this at first, but she quickly made friends and is excelling academically so this isn't a huge problem. She's been off school for the last few months anyway due to the situation.

A bigger problem is clothing. Like my sister Amy loves fashion and designer stuff. She's still got a lot of stuff that her parents got her, but she's always on the lookout for new clothes. Unfortunately, I can't afford anywhere near the sort of stuff she likes, and I also have two children of my own whose clothing I have to pay for. I have told my sister this, but she insists I should ""make allowances"" because her daughter is going through a tough time. 

Amy also really doesn't get along with my daughter Hannah, who is 11. She bullies her, calls her stupid and ugly, tells her none of her friends really like her etc. She has made her cry on many occasions and and often continues to taunt Hannah while she cries. 

Yesterday I caught Amy trying to buy a dress costing over a thousand with my card. I was fuming and had a long conversation with her. She cried, and sobbed that she just wanted one nice thing. 

My sister called from the prison, and Amy cried over the phone that she hates here and I treat her unfairly. I spoke to my sister afterwards and she begged me to go easy on her daughter because she's ""still adjusting"". 

I put food on this kid's plate. I buy her whatever clothes I can afford, even if they aren't to her taste. I take her to visit her parents as much as possible (they're held in different facilities) and I do all of that on top of working and looking after my own children. 

I told my sister that I was willing to look after her daughter for as long as she needs, but if anything like the card incident happens again, or if she continues to pick on my daughter, there will be serious consequences for her. My sister wanted to argue but they get limited time on the prison phone. 

I think what I'm doing is right. I get that the kid is going through a tough time, and I'm doing everything I can to be there for her. But I can't just tolerate bad behaviour or bullying, and I can't afford to pay for her expensive clothing.

AITA for treating my two daughters' pregnancies differently?,"When my oldest told me she was pregnant, she was still in college, unemployed and the baby's father was refusing to be involved.

I love my grandchild but the birth didn't exactly happen in the happiest of circumstances.

My oldest daughter ended up back in a relationship with the baby's father and they are happy and stable now. 

My younger daughter announced her pregnancy a few months ago and the situation cannot be more different. She's married to her husband who she's been with for several years, they're both financially stable and the baby is clearly planned.

I have had zero stress dealing with my daughter's pregnancy this time and I've been generally happier about it. I was unknowingly proving I was more excited this time around which I have since corrected. I also planned a baby shower for my youngest which I didn't do for my oldest.

My oldest is furious. I can imagine why but I feel she should understand how different the circumstances were.

She's said some really hurtful things to me and has prevented me from seeing my grandchild, even on the phone. I have already apologized a few times but it hasn't made a difference.

My youngest is now having some pregnancy related health issues and we're feeling very scared. I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.

AITA for refusing to split my inheritance with my siblings?,"I’ll try to summarize as much as possible. 

I (f19) have an estranged grandpa more or less. He’s my dad’s father, but my dad hardly had a relationship with him. I have two other siblings (one younger, (13) and one older (26). My grandma divorced my grandpa when my dad was only 10, so he lived with my grandma his whole life in a different state and didn’t see him. 

When he got older he saw him a little more and my grandpa started coming around a little bit more as well. He’d stay for a week at a time and then go home. He was an old, bitter man to be honest. He never got remarried and lived his whole life in his coastal town with the same friends he’d had his whole life. 

He wasn’t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone I’ve ever met. But regardless of this, he was filthy rich. He owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. He retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. So it sold for well over $3m. 

I was never close with my grandpa, but I took after his sister who is an RN and he adores her. He always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. 

He died a few months ago. Since then, my family has been torn apart. He left everything to me. He essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. I was shocked. I didn’t and still don’t know what to do with the money, but I’m going to save it. 

My dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. I just can’t do it. 

My dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. Despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. My dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. 

As far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he’s very wasteful and ungrateful. He never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. 

My little sister is the only person I’ve actually considered. She’s very young and that’s really the only thing stopping me. Her mom is money oriented and would take the money from her. So I’m waiting until she turns 18 and i offered to pay for her college. 

But now my family is telling me I’m unfair and the money doesn’t belong to me and I’m not deserving of it. That I’m too young and I’ll waste it on cars and clothes.

When I was 5, my parents brought my dad’s friend’s daughter X (about 3) to live with me and sister Y (7). X’s family was poor and couldn’t support their children (they had 6) so they sent X here because they really trusted my parents. 

X, Y, and I grew up together, and my parents were awesome to all three of us. I had a lot of fun growing up and I am extremely close to my family.  

I’m now 29. Three years back, I went abroad for my masters and then went back to my country. There, I met a girl P and we fell in love. I’d like to propose soon and felt like this would be a good time to introduce P to my family (Y already knew of her and P just graduated). 

This weekend I told my family that I would like for them to meet someone special and set-up a video call. No idea who they were expecting, but when they realized P was my girlfriend, everything just blew up.  

Apparently, they had already “discussed and arranged” my marriage with X years back, and she was the one I would have to marry. X was aware, her father had told her. Cue lots of screaming and yelling, including some choice words from X to P about how she’s a “modern girl” (euphemism in my culture for slut) and how she must be after me for my money (she comes from a richer family). I was just too shocked to react initially. 

The next day I told my parents that I look at X as family. They started saying ridiculous things like they’ve never let her into my room (while apparently Y was allowed) and drawing all sorts of other parallels between X and Y trying to demonstrate why X wasn’t like my sister. They also said stuff like no one can understand me better than X and that she will “keep the family together” while P will “alienate” me from them. They also told me I’m ruining the family.

X also cried nonstop and then shut herself in the room, accusing me of not wanting her only because she was poor amongst other things. She also said no one from her village would marry her now because her family has told everyone back home that she’s going to be marrying me. 

My sister was not aware of any of this either. 

Now – I told X I don’t care that no one will marry her from her village (it is a likely possibility) or that her life is “ruined”. I also told my parents I won’t ruin my life for them to be able to “keep their word”. X’s father is coming to our house once he’s able to (transport restrictions still in place), but he had a long phone call with parents. I’m sure a LOT of emotional blackmail is to follow, and I already feel rather guilty about X because she’s a nice girl. 

My sister is on my side. But even if my parents cut me off and at the risk of X ruining her life, I am not going to go ahead with this at all. AITA?

Edit: A lot of people asking me where I'm from - It's a SE Asian country, just don't want to say if it's the exact place you guys are asking about. 

X was apparently aware I didn't know. But she was told by my parents and hers that I'm a ""Family man"" and will do the ""right thing"" so there's no need to worry. She's basically accused me of wrecking the family too. 

My sister is really upset on my behalf, and also that she wasn't told any of this. My sister's family (her husband and his parents) have said if there's any sort of confrontation, they'll be there to back me up.

Not sure if this detail counts, but P is also from my country but also came abroad to study. So that's not a reason as to why my parents are unaccepting of P. They just want me to marry X.",Not the A-hole
AITA for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? They’ve just found out and are acting like I’ve betrayed them.,"My children are 17 and 14 respectively, and I’m hoping the fact that they’re teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

My husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in Canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

I had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. 

I have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I’m keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I’ve had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

We had two children- two sons. We’d never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it’s a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
He has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

My mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was ‘time for them to know’. She didn’t consult us before telling them, and certainly didn’t do it in our presence. 

Since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they’ve been prodding their dad asking why we’d never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they’re acting like we’ve kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

My 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I’d ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

He told me that it made ‘so much sense’ why we were abnormal, why we don’t drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children’s lives as a result of us staying quiet. I am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and I don’t know how to proceed. I have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",Not the A-hole
AITA for rejecting a disabled girl's prom asking?,"Alright so today was quite traumatic for me. I'm a high school senior (18M) and promposal season is currently in full swing. 

I was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, ""aww that's sweet of her."" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. 

One of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. 

So I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people. At this point, one of her aids came out to check on us since she could hear the crying and the girl told her aid what happened and she straight up glared at me and said, ""That's not okay."" 

Now I feel like absolute shit. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?,"So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

AITA for telling my parents to stop hooking me up with single girls from their church? AITA for not wanting to get married?,"The last year and a half has been hard for me, to say the least.

Last March, my brilliant and hilarious and beautiful girlfriend Natalie suddenly passed away.  Everyone always gave shit about us because of politics.  We met in college when were were poly sci majors: she is very liberal (think AOC) and I'm pretty conservative.  We actually met because we were serving as treasurers for our school's College Democrats and Young Republicans clubs, respectively, and our groups would get together for drinks or bowling or laser tag once a month.  

Well, Natalie and I bonded over a lot of shared interests and we hit it off.  Even if we didn't see eye to eye on many issues, debating her was stimulating and formed the cornerstone of our relationship.  We've had debates that went on until dawn.  We just bounced off each other.  She liked to joke that we were ""drift compatible"".  

I wanted to marry this woman, but she passed away before we got a chance to talk about marriage.  I'm in therapy and I'm working through working through not having her in my life anymore, but it's been rough.  Then 'Rona happened and I got laid off, so I had to move back in with my parents and figure out what I am supposed to do now.

My parents mean well, but they got married really young and are more conservative and religious than me.  They've been trying to set me up on dates with single girls from their church since I moved back home.  But I don't want to date these girls.

No offense to them, but it's a small town in the American Breadbasket.  They don't share the same interests as me and it feels like their only goal in life is to be a good Christian wife and produce a lot of babies.  Trying to talk to them about current events is excruciating for me.  The girls my parents tried to set me up with take everything they read on Facebook or hear from Fox News for face value.  It makes me miss Natalie and our debates more. 

My parents mean well.  I know they want me to find a nice girl and settle down with her, but not like this.  They are nothing like Natalie and never will be.  I miss her, even if my folks didn't like her ideas.  

But when I told them the other night that I wanted them to stop setting me up on dates with these girls, they freaked out and told me that I needed to consider settling down since I just turned thirty.  They're good girls from great families, I know that, and my parents like them more than they liked Natalie, but she was my one and only.  I don't think it's fair for anyone when I still love her.  

They are even more angry at me because I told them that I just don't see myself getting married anytime soon.  But like I said, Natalie was my soulmate and I just can't see myself being with anyone else but her.  Yet, they are insisting that I need to find a woman and settle down and give them grandchildren.

Edit:  We were seriously close to talking about marriage.  But around the time she died, it was more like how funny it would be if the bridal party wore blue and the groomsmen wore red because the bride is a Democrat and the groom is a Republican/Romeo and Juliet deal.

Fuck, I wish we got to do that.  Natalie thought it was hilarious.

AITA For cancelling my daughters therapy because she has bad grades?,"My daughter (14) had anxiety problems ever since she was little but it was not severe. 3 months ago, my daughter changed drastically. She stopped eating, talking to us or her friends and her marks dropped. We were really concerned and her teachers strongly suggested we take her to therapy which we did and she was diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety which was expected.

The therapy sessions look like they helped her well, in the first month she already began making progress and started talking to us and her friends again and is eating whatever her mother is cooking. We were really happy to see this and every day she would get better and better. The thing is, her marks did not. They are terrible and she ended up barely passing the year. This is what infuriated me and made me cancel her therapy sessions. I know to some it might sound terrible, but paying $120 per session and seeing no progress in her marks makes me feel like I am seriously wasting my money (now that she returned back to normal). Not only that but since she really enjoys going to therapy I think telling her that she needs to get higher marks to continue her therapy sessions will motivate her to study harder and thus score better marks.

My wife disagrees with my logic and we had a massive argument because of it which ended up with her saying that she is going to pay from ‘her money’ which hurt me since I see my and her money as ours. My daughter is also really upset on me and was begging me to keep her therapy sessions but I think I am going to stick to this plan. AITA here?

EDIT: I deeply apologize for my ignorant replies and for hurting so many people. Please know that I had no intention in offending anyone and it was so upsetting to see how mental illness has affected many of you. I hope you guys can overcome this one day. I have talked to my wife and her therapy sessions will continue.",Asshole
AITA for telling my cousin I won’t make an exception for her son at my wedding?,"I (26F) am getting married in about two months. I sent out my wedding invitations recently and at the bottom it says “ADULTS ONLY. NO EXCEPTIONS.” First let me say that I love kids. But my fiancé and I made the decision to not allow kids/babies to our ceremony because they get bored, cry, won’t sit still, have tantrums... and I just don’t want that to happen during our wedding. We’re also going to have an open bar, and I don’t particularly want a bunch of drunk adults around my little cousins or my friend’s children. 

I have a cousin, we’ll call her Sam, that text me last night saying “so you’re dead honest seriously telling me I cannot bring (her son) to your wedding”- to which I said yes. Sam responds “then I can’t come and that f****** kills me. I just want you to know how badly I want to be there and I have dreamt my entire life of standing next to you at your wedding. But I just can’t want to be somewhere with someone who doesn’t want the other half of my heart there.” 

She’s trying guilt trip me into letting her bring her son. Saying “and I’ve confided in my best friends and they say it’s your wedding it’s your right to have it the way you want, but yeah. I just want you to know it’s not vengeance when I don’t come. I’ll probably cry like a b**** the entire day.” I suggested that she take her son (he’s seven) to his friends house for a few hours, so that she can attend. She says “I can’t just tell him no and leave him somewhere. I’m not strong enough to do that to his sensitive little heart. I could, if he wasn’t so aware and sensitive. It would hurt him too much. He’s too smart to manipulate.”

I’m not asking her to manipulate her son. I’m asking that she be an adult, and tell him he can’t come and that children aren’t allowed to attend, so she’ll take him to his friends while she’s gone.

Not to mention, that she’s angry that I didn’t choose her to be my Maid of Honor. I chose my step-sister. While on the phone, Sam said “I don’t mean any offense by this, but FUCK HER.” She’s literally only mad because my dad cheated on my mom 10 years ago and married the woman he cheated with. She hates my sister, because she hates my step mom. 

I ended up being on the phone with her for half an hour talking to her about this. With her constantly telling me “I’m trying to get sober, so I just wanted to talk to you and tell you how I feel.” Which to me, sounds like she’s going to blame me if I still tell her no, and she decides to drink/so drugs again. 

We ended the phone call with her saying “will you just promise me one thing, even if it’s a lie? Will you just promise me that you’ll consider it, and that you’ll talk to your fiancé about it?” So I told her yes, that I promised I’d consider it/talk to him about it. And I did, I considered it, I talked (angry cried) to him, and I’m not changing my mind. 

Am I the Asshole?

***************************************

UPDATE: I texted her two days ago, and used the wording suggested by u/sunny_sally. 

“There’s nothing I want more than for you to be at my wedding. I love (her son), but after speaking to (fiancé), we came to the conclusion that we still do not feel comfortable having kids at our wedding. This is a decision we made before we started the planning, knowing that some people might disagree with it. If you aren’t able to get a baby sitter, I would completely understand why you wouldn’t come. And I also spoke with (her step dad), he said he will be attending.”

She responded in less than a minute and said “ok.”

AITA for being angry at my family for lying about my birth parents race,"I’m 23M. I’ve known I was adopted all along. For whatever reason I became obsessed with learning more about my birth parents at age 13. I was told all my life that my parents met both of my birth parents before I was officially adopted. My mom was white from South America and my dad was white from Italy. They specified these two locations to explain why I had tan skin.

As I was growing up certain things about my physical makeup made me more curious about my birth parents. My hair was kept short as a kid but as a teen I wanted to experiment. I grew it out and it grew out curly. Big curls but still curly. This upset my parents so they asked that I not grow it out. When I moved away for college I began to let it grow again. I met my girlfriend in school. She is Black American so she also helped me care for it. She once braided my hair before I FaceTimed my parents who lost it on me for wearing it that way. 

Throughout my time in school I still searched for my birth mom but would always come up empty. My girlfriend hinted that there must’ve been a mistake with the information, even down to the name my parents claimed I had before they adopted me. She gifted me a DNA kit on my birthday that I didn’t get around to until the lockdown hit. I didn’t think anything would come of it because my parents weren’t American so I didn’t know if it would work that way. So I sent it out of boredom and got my results weeks later which have changed everything.

I’m Black and Middle Eastern. I have light skin and my curl pattern is so loose that I hadn’t considered it a sign before. I have ancestral ties to Iran which can explain a more “European” facial structure. I’m sorry for my wording, I’m still learning. I sent my gf a screenshot and she called me right away. We were both stunned though she long suspected. I tried to believe that my parents were innocently misinformed but my girlfriend kept pointing out the inconsistencies. My parents claimed to have met my birth parents therefore they couldn’t have mistaken them for white. 

I confronted my parents who became enraged at me for doing a DNA kit. I was very angry, yelling, swearing. They robbed me of my identity and hindered my search with their lies. My mom told me through tears that my racial background comes with a stigma. That I passed so she wanted me to have an easier life fitting in. My dad yelled at me that I had to abandon what I just learned. I rage broke my phone and left. My siblings have been hitting me up on social media reprimanding me for being upset because our parents reasoning is sound. I do pass, I did have an easy life. I’m not asking to be part of a struggle all of a sudden. I just don’t think I should’ve been lied to and I think they’re reasoning is bullshit and racist. I’m just supposed to act like 10 years of me searching with the wrong info isn’t that big of a deal?

Edit: 

There’s no way I can respond to all of you. Some answers:

DNA kits can be wrong/Parents can be White South Africans:

My parents admit that my mom was black. My oldest sister also recalls seeing my mom at some point. Both verify that she was black. Yes they could be lying again. I have plans to continue to look into my background.

YTA for having a temper/breaking your phone:

Okay, that’s fair. Someone was shocked that I could break my phone. I threw it. I didn’t break it with my bare hands. I walked out and threw it out of anger and it shattered. 

How do your parents treat your girlfriend:

They tried to treat her poorly. They were okay at first but eventually some comments were made that caused me to put some distance between us. My girlfriend was very hurt by their statements so I chose to keep us both away from them. 

Claims that I’m race baiting: 

I don’t understand how. I’m angry about being lied to and how that lie has made my effort into finding my birth parents completely void while also rewriting my heritage. 

You likely didn’t pass to other POC: 

That’s my girlfriends stance as well. I’m tan enough that going to an all white school still got me called slurs. Whatever issues my parents were trying to shield me from it didn’t work. Maybe this is a lie that I bought into alone.

The current state of my relationship with my family:

It’s chaos. Two of my siblings are trying to be supportive. I deactivated my Facebook and unfollowed some people on Instagram. I can’t entertain the argument that I should forgive my parents and move on. I’m not there yet. I get that it makes me ungrateful for feeling this way.

For those who asked about my hair lol. They are big curls? My girlfriend says they are 2c/3a. My hair texture is not unique to any race group but drastically different from my family’s. 

For those of you who are pming me slurs and telling me to go back to my shit hole country, thanks a lot. 

I appreciate your support. I appreciate those of you who shared your personal experiences with adoption and race with me, for giving me resources, books, and documentary suggestions, for welcoming me into your groups and giving me some kind words. I’m overwhelmed by your support. I’ve written down a lot of those recommendations. I’m still reading everything you guys have written as well. I appreciate the kind comments about my parents as well. I don’t hate them, I’m just really upset and disappointed in their decisions.",Not the A-hole
AITA for “tattling” on my boyfriend to his mother,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

Since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He’ll sit on the couch and play video games and he’ll only tend to her while she’s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I’m in the middle of doing something right then, he’ll ask me why I can’t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he’s watching tv and she’s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won’t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We’ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I’ve told him I can’t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

I’m honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn’t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what’s going on.

She called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he’s upset with me for involving his mother and for “taking a video out of context.” I’m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?

"AITA for recreating a ""secret"" cookie recipe the person does not give out?","My boyfriend's mom makes theses amazing cookie bars. She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was ""hers"" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.

I started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).

I then decided to make it ""my own"" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.

He was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said ""One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better."" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making ""her"" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.

She started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.

While I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I ""made it even better"" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?

\*\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:

I used the recipe below for the ""base"" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.

AITA for donating my daughters college fund instead of giving it to my step daughter to help buy a house,"So I have a 16 year old daughter that passed away in a car accident October 19th. I’ve been collecting a college fund for her since she was young, my ex husband and I both put money into it as well as she put some of her paychecks from work into it, and it’s about $25,000 full. I recently got remarried to a man who has a 30 year old daughter. My step daughter doesn’t like me, because I’m only 3 years older than her, my husband is significantly older than I am. 


My daughter was very passionate about the environment, and my ex husband and I discussed what we would do with the college fund. My husband says it was my daughter and I can do what I feel is right to honor her. 

We decided to divide it and we would each donate to charities we felt would make our daughter proud. 

My step daughter however thinks we should split it evenly and she should get some cushion for buying a house, since I’m married to her father and that makes my contribution his money too. 

She thinks donating *essentially* $13000 wouldn’t mean anything to a big charity and I could help someone I know in real life.


My husband has since joined her side and thinks $13000 would help her buy a house and we can honor my daughter in another way.


AITA for not wanting to change my plans?


Edit: there seems to be some confusion and I’m so sorry for  wording it poorly


My ex husband and I, and a little bit my daughter are the sole people putting money into the fund. My current husband has not put any money into the fund from his personal finances. 

My step daughter and my biological daughter did not have a relationship, as my step daughter is almost twice her age.

AITA for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?,"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I’ve never objected to people crossing our land as I’m an avid hiker and don’t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It’s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she’ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it’s a multi day hike). 

It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It “feels like” 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren’t connected to an endless supply of water.

They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I’ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. 

They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl’s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way. My wife says I should have filled them up, but IMO so long as the little girl is okay I don’t think they deserved anything given their attitude.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for talking frankly about my abortion, when my coworker was making some wild generalizations about what abortions are like?","
I was in the break room at work and my coworker Arthur who tends to talk a lot about politics... Got to talking about politics. 

It was me, my coworker John who I'm good friends with, Adam who I don't know too well, and Arthur in the room. I was kinda sitting back from the discussion because I wanted to chill and eat lunch.

But it kind of annoyed me that Arthur was making comments about women getting abortions without knowing what they're getting into, making impulse decisions because they're scared of Parenthood. As if this is a big thing that happens often.

I spoke up and said I didn't think it was like that; our state has mandatory counseling and meetings to make sure the person is giving informed consent. And I didn't think anyone was going about it willy nilly without knowing what they were doing.

He got kind of blustery, saying ""how do you know that they don't just rush you through that, tick a few boxes?""

I said that when I'd had mine, I had a very practical and informative counseling session that gave me a lot of information on my options, what I'd expect from the procedure, what my specific risks of continuing with a pregnancy would be, due to a medical condition of mine. And I didn't feel at all like I was doing something I didn't understand.

It was really awkwardly silent for a bit. Arthur told me that wasn't appropriate for me to have said at work, and it's something I ought to keep quieter. I bit back the childish urge to comment that he started it. 

Later, John, my friend from work said he thought it was funny, how I threw Arthur's assumptions in his face, but he thinks I ought to be a little more careful because Arthur is probably gonna think differently of me now. 

I don't feel ashamed to talk about it, but I do see how it was a lot to say at work...

AITA for getting 3 co-workers fired for making a hot list?,"A bunch of people from my department at work went for drinks on Friday after work. Everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there (from about 30 people in our department). I go to the bathroom, and as I am about to exit the hall to the bathroom I hear my co-worker say my name from around the corner of the wall. Perhaps I shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and I did.

I overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a ""hot list"" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. I was upset and disturbed. I was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. Yesterday morning I tell HR and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. All three men were fired first thing this morning, and now I feel terrible.

I hated the way they were talking about women, but I didn't think they should be fired. With that said, we work for a large company that I know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down I suppose I knew it was a possibility when I complained. Nobody knows that I am the person who reported them, and I've overheard people say that the person is a ""snitch"". I'm wondering if I should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how it made me feel instead, but at the time I didn't feel comfortable doing that. I especially feel bad because I had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.

AITA?

INFO 1: It was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going out for drinks

INFO 2: A lot of people are insisting that I am upset because I was low on the list. I tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments I feel like I have to address it. I was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement; I was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. I hate that I even have to write this

I came here for judgment on whether I am an asshole in this situation, and I have gotten numerous personal messages calling me ugly, a bitch, fat, a nazi, psycho, etc. I really think something needs to be done about this sub, although admittedly I'm not sure what, because I can't believe this is the response for somebody using this sub for its intended purpose**

AITA for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?,"Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",Asshole
AITA for using home security cameras to expose my girlfriend’s gaslighting?,"My GF Anne (25F) and I (25M) have been dating the past 5 years, since college. After graduation, we were semi-long distance, living close enough that we alternately visited almost every weekend. In 2018, Anne got a job in my city, and we found a place and moved in together.

Now’s a good time to mention the security cameras in our house: break-ins are unfortunately common where we live. We thus got some motion activated cameras, one of which has a view of our kitchen (to monitor the back door). The cameras only record when there’s motion so they can retain footage for a very long time. Anne of course knows this.

About a year ago, Anne started complaining I wasn’t contributing equally to chores. I’ve been obsessive about chores my whole life; growing up, not doing the dishes meant no videogames for a week. When I lived with roommates, I was always the chore Nazi, making damn sure we all stuck to our chore wheel. Anne is just as fastidious about chores, so we just naturally alternated who did what.

I’d just been brushing her remarks off, but over the last few months they’ve become much more aggressive, e.g. I was vacuuming and Anne said “look at you finally cleaning up around here!” I replied that we alternated vacuuming, to which she retorted “no, you’ve vacuumed maybe twice since I moved in.” Exchanges like this have been happening so frequently that I began to doubt my own recollection; am I not as clean as I thought?

Finally, she exploded at me last week. She said that having to stay home constantly over the past weeks exposed how little I do around the house, and that she didn’t move in just to be my maid. Questioning my own sanity, I spent a few hours going through the entire 1.5 year archive of security camera footage, and tallied the exact number of times the kitchen cam caught each of us doing dishes. Our cleaning supplies (vacuum/mop/etc.) are in the kitchen pantry, so I also tallied up how many times we grabbed cleaning stuff.

To my vindication, the tally showed that we indeed split chores equally. She vacuumed/mopped \~5 more times than I did; I did dishes \~20 more times than she did. Given that we vacuum/mop at least once a week and do dishes at least every day, these are insignificant differences over the year and a half we’ve lived together.

When I confronted Anne, she shrugged off her behavior as “remembering things differently,” but the real sin here was what *I* did, which she called an “unforgivable violation of *her* privacy,” akin to abusive stalking. She has broken up with me and is trying to move out, although obviously this is difficult due to current circumstances.

I’m totally heartbroken - Anne was the love of my life and I can’t believe she destroyed our relationship like this. To make matters worse, she told many of our friends, who are mostly siding with her! They’ve been texting me that what I did was creepy, abusive, controlling, invasive, etc. I’m at a loss; I’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s off base here.

Edit: some people thought I vacuumed ""5x more"" and she did dishes ""20x more,"" I clarified the wording that it was literally 5 _more times_/20 _more times_, total, over 1.5 years.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister that her husband was bullshitting her?,"**Edit**: I got overwhelmed trying to respond to comments, but thanks a ton to everyone who commented!

To people asking whether my in-laws are really named Jake and Leah — no, it comes from a bible story, and I thought I’d be clever with the aliases. 

To people asking why I haven’t intervened before in my sister’s relationship — I’ve tried to gently bring it up, but I was worried about hurting her or being wrong. My partner and I are currently stuck in my home state due to COVID, but I actually have a job in another country that I’ll be returning to once the pandemic ends. I haven’t been around my sister too much in the past year, but I did try to call her a few times a week before I moved back. 

Finally, to the people calling my sister stupid — she is not. Please have a little empathy, the idea that your husband might be cheating can be hard to face.

This is a wild situation. To give some background, I (32F) have a sister “Leah” (26F). She’s been married to “Jake” for five years, and they have two kids. We all grew up very Christian, I ended up leaving the church, but my sis and BIL are still on fire Christians.

Anyway, Leah has mentioned things to me that seem very sketchy. I think Jake is cheating, but she won’t accept the thought. He leaves their bed at night and doesn’t come back til after work the next day, he hides money, and he’s trying not to conceive another kid with my sister. I’ve gently tried to give her a reality check, but it hasn’t worked.

Well, on Friday after work they 
came over to swim (totally fine in our state). Jake was swimming with the kids, and my sister and I were sitting in the grass keeping an extra eye on them. Jake had lots of red scratches on his back, to me they looked like fingernails. I made a joke to my sister about their dry spell being over, and she said they still hadn’t had sex in a year. 

I gently told her that they looked like finger marks, and that it was sketchy as hell. She said casually that Jake had gone on a “prayer walk” with his men’s group and had been spiritually attacked by a demon. Now, we grew up with these kinds of beliefs, but I told her that was crazy and just an excuse. 

She got really flustered and pulled her kids out of the pool. She told Jake she had a headache, and they left.

AITA for booking up an entire row of seats just for myself?,"For reference this, all happened before the lockdown and orders to shelter in place. 

I (32f) broke my leg in two places a couple of months ago and was placed in a full leg cast. I took convalescent leave and decided to fly to my home state. I'm originally from CA but stationed in NC this is relevant so everyone understands the time frame for the flight in question. 

To avoid any added pain and to be able to prop my leg up I paid for the entire row of seats. Thank God for miles points. Flying can cause swelling so I wanted to alleviate it for myself as much as possible. When I got onto my flight I sat in the window seat and stretched my leg out across the seats. 

When everyone else started boarding a couple approached me asking if anyone was sitting next to me. I said no, no one is sitting next to me because I bought out the entire row of seats. So the husband (an older man maybe mid-40s?) asked if they could use the vacant seats because she wanted to sit next to his wife. I POLITELY told him I'm sorry sir but no I need them that's why I paid for all three. He kept at it but I stood firm that these were my seats. 

The called the flight attendant came over because we were starting to make a scene and asked me to put my leg down and not occupy the other seats. I again explained I paid for all three seats and showed her the tickets. She told me while I did pay for the seats I was being rather selfish as it was a booked up flight and said couldn't I just be more accommodating to others. 

I was extremely pissed off at this point I mean it was blatant I had a broken leg. I told her no I'm not going up my seats not sitting together is the risk you take if you book late. I pointed down at my cast and said shouldn't you be more accomodating to me actually considering I'm the one with an obvious medical issue? 

They left calling me a selfish bitch. But I don't think I was I paid for all three seats so I wouldn't inconvenience anyone else. I've talked it over with some friends and most are on my side while others have said I was a bit of an AH I should have just given up the seats and sucked it up. But it was a 5+ hour flight for fuck's sake.

Edit: so I don't have to keep repeating myself here. 


* I'm female lol.


* The flight was United. 


* No sitting at the bulkhead or exit wouldn't have helped because I needed to prop my leg up. Also being that I was physically compromised sitting at the exit with limited capacity I would have been unable perform the tasks required in the unlikely event of there being an emergency.


* Business class offered extra leg room but again doesn't help with needing to prop my leg up. 


* All of first class was booked.

AITA for naming my daughter the name I chose years ago?,"I had my daughter a week ago. I had chosen her name a long while ago because it had a very personal meaning for me. Before I was pregnant my sister and I had been talking about what we'd like to name our kids and I told her the girl name I really wanted to use. She complimented me on it and then we didn't talk about it again. She gave birth to my niece five months ago and guess what name she used? That's right. THE name I had chosen so long ago. I didn't care. Was a little annoyed by it but I wasn't going to let it stop me from using the name.

Now she's annoyed I used the name too. She told me it was weird that I would use it and that the cousins have the same first, middle and last name. I told her I wasn't going to change the name I had wanted for a long time, that had a deep meaning for me, just because she decided to use it after I told her the name. She said as the first one to have a baby she got dibs. I told her to get over it and it was a name anyone could use.

AITA?

I don't think she's an asshole fyi. I think she's entitled to use the name. But she's kinda being assholeish when she knows how I felt about the name.

Editing to add details I provided below so I it doesn't keep getting asked.

My husband took my name when we got married and my sister is a single mom, hence the same name.

We live 2 hours from each other.

The first name was my best friends name. She died when we were 14 and I always planned to name a daughter after her to honor her. So it is very special. The middle name holds important significance due to a trauma I suffered and the healing it brought in a situation (it's a weird story I will admit and I shared more detail in reply to someone but I'm not in the mental state to write it out again).

The discussion was 3ish years ago. It was the full name I mentioned.

She is spelling the middle name slightly different.",Not the A-hole
AITA for yelling at my sister in law?,"Context here: I'm an ex heroin addict. The why and how isn't important, but I got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. I'm 26 now and completely clean. I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.

Now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.

She's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. I mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

I went away recently with some friends. On the first day of my trip, I dropped and broke my phone. Because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced I had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. When I got home, I found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. It was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and I sort of flipped at my sister in law. I yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that I'm incapable of staying clean. She got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but I said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. At that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. I'm being told left and right that I'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and I need to apologise, but I'm still upset that she evidently believes I'm incapable of doing this.

I told her that if he was looking at me that is his problem and that I wasn't trying to cause anything.  She was PISSED at me, like I haven't seen her this mad at me since we were kids and had to share a room.  She full on told me ""not to dress like a whore when her BF is over"".

AITA for making fun of my boyfriend's penis,"Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

So the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and I write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! Ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

After we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what.

She had 3 kids from a previous marriage, an 18yo girl 17yo boy and 15yo girl, I am 18 so I'm the same age as the oldest, but I'm older by a couple months. At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm ""not one of them"" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo. My dad and step mom tried to make us all one blended family but it just didn't work, I was open to it but they were intent on just blocking me out. Around 12 I just stopped trying and did my own thing, I have absolutely 0 relationship or attachment with any of them.  

Main problem:  I was away at a friends house and I forgot to lock the door to my room.  My step siblings have had a problem with going into my room cause I keep my stuff organized and I’m the only one with a tv in my room (I paid for it).

It’s not much but I like it, I guess all 3 were watching tv and somehow my urn got knocked over.........a lot of the ash is now in my carpet and now it’s basically just an empty thing.  When I got home I flipped my shit, it got bad enough that my dad came into my room and sent them out.  When I told him what happened he said that he’s sorry and that he will talk to him.  (This is where I may be the AH) my dad said something about never being too mad at “family”.  I had enough and told him exactly this “they aren’t my family, they have made home life shit for years and now knocked over the ashes of my mom.  I fucking HATE them.”  He went quiet and didn’t say anything and just left my room. 

My step siblings haven’t apologized (not that I’d accept anything they say). I feel bad what I said to my dad but I don’t regret a word of what I said.  AITA?

Edit: thanks for the awards!!! 

Edit 2: when I was 7 I did something really stupid and put the plastic bag out and poured the ashes straight into the urn.  I regretted once I did it but I was a dumb 7yo.  And the urn has a chip in the ring so it never screwed on right and was wobbly",Not the A-hole
AITA for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip,"Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

Me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn’t want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
We also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn’t want to go through that again in this one.

The fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.

Anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

First I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be “discovering herself” on this trip, and when I asked why hadn’t she told me she said because I wouldn’t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)

Well an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

Gf: “why can’t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest”

Me: “you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out”

I believe it was the right thing to do as she didn’t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn’t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

That night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?

TLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house.

So I find him crying and holding an incredibly swollen, red arm sitting on the ground and refuses to let anyone touch it. My wife is sitting on the couch crying and saying how his arm looks so bad. I pick him up to go to the emergency room. I try to dress him since he can’t open his arms and ask her to get the car seat ready. She doesn’t move and keeps crying. I give up and do the best I can and call for my wife to get in...she just sobs and shakes her head saying “I can’t I can’t.” So I drive off without her.

I got really annoyed at my wife at this point. We get to the hospital and they want to run him through some X-rays and he’s screaming bloody murder. Around 3pm I get a call from my daughter’s school saying that no one’s picked her up (my wife’s job) so I call my wife. No one picks up. I call 3-4 more times before I rush out to the school. My son was inconsolable at me leaving him. Even the doctors were confused why I had to leave so soon. 

I get home with my daughter and rush in to find my wife STILL CRYING on the phone to her sister. I absolutely let loose and yelled “where the FUCK were you??? Why didn’t you answer my calls?” She’s shocked and just screams at me back that she’s overwhelmed and can’t handle all this right now. I get our daughter out and tell my wife to look after her. My daughter is crying because mom’s crying and hangs on to my legs wanting to go with me. My wife makes no move to help me so I just ended up bringing our daughter with me to the hospital.

The next day while our kids were both sleeping I couldn’t hold back and yelled at my wife for being absolutely zero help. She got equally mad and told me I humiliated her in front of her sister (when I yelled when she was on the phone) and that I should’ve been more considerate of the fact that she is really bad in emergencies. While I know she’s not great in emergencies, this was something else and I felt like I didn’t have a partner at all. 

Now she wants an emergency couples counseling session to “address my rage” but I am honestly conflicted. I’ve never yelled at her before and I do feel guilty but I also feel like these circumstances were extreme. However I did apologize for yelling and wonder if I made things worse.

AITA For siding with my brother and SIL over my parents?,"My brother and my SIL have been married for 6 years. I love them both dearly. They adopted a little girl about a year ago. My parents were happy about this too, at first. They got really angry when my brother and SIL announced recently that their daughter would be their only child and they do not want biological kids.

&#x200B;

My mom and dad lost their shit. They told my brother he *had* to get my SIL pregnant. He was the family's male heir and he would have to have a biological son to carry forward the family name. This makes no sense to me, nor my bro and SIL. It's not as if we're a family of European royalty. Who gives a fuck about the family name in this day and age? Well, my parents do apparently. They've been berating my brother and guilt tripping my sister in law, making her feel like she's taking something away from our family. On one occasion they actually suggested that my brother leave my SIL if she didn't want to get pregnant and have a son with another woman.

&#x200B;

What's even worse is that they've stopped paying attention to my niece. Earlier, they would call and talk to her almost everyday. But ever since they were told about my bro and SIL's decision, they've stopped calling her. This pisses me off and has deeply saddened my bro and SIL. The child is  3 years old and doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, when I called my brother, he seemed very upset. He told me that mom and dad had called him and they had talked about something unrelated. When he asked if they wanted to talk to their granddaughter, they said they'd talk to their *real* grandchild when my brother came to his senses and decided to give them one.

&#x200B;

I was angrier than I've been in a long time. I called my parents and unloaded on them. I told them how selfish and cruel they were being  and how dare they take out their anger on my niece, along with a lot of other things I can't even remember. My mom started crying as she's not used to being yelled at. I understand that yelling at them may have been a bit much, but I just can't believe how awful they are being towards a kid. So am I the asshole? Or are they?

EDIT  : Some people have been wondering how my parents would act when I have kids. No need to worry about that since I won't be having any. I made this clear to my parents years ago and yes they threw a fit over this. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though I’m not religious?,"I’m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don’t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn’t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

Even though I’m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She’d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. 

For the last six months I’ve been having my 30 mins ‘meditating’ out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have ‘meditative time’ and it’s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and ‘ruining it’ for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I’m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",Not the A-hole
AITA for laughing at my son's girlfriend when she asked me to pay her compensation for the money I spend on my other grandchild?,"I have two grandchildren. One is seven and the other is five. The seven year old is the child of my daughter and I do have more access to her, but despite what my son's girlfriend accuses me of, i do not have a favorite. The seven year old does beauty pageants. They are completely her choice, but she saw pictures from her mother and I doing them and begged to be in them. She also rides horses. Combined this is very expensive and I pay for it all. I've offered and I am happy to do so.

My son's girlfriend is morally opposed to pageants and afraid of horses. Her daughter has asked to do what her cousin does but isn't allowed to. She does tee ball and music lessons, which I also pay for but they are significantly cheaper than what the seven year old does. The other day my son's girlfriend brought up this ""favoritism"" I said it isn't favoritism, because I pay for two activities for both of them. She said it is going to give her daughter a ""complex"" so I need to even the money off and put the rest in a savings account. My husband and I laughed because that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and she stormed out of the house. My son actually said I should post this because he is conflicted (afraid of her).

AITA for discriminating my grandchildren,"My daughter (L) got pregnant in her twenties and gave up a child for adoption. Though my husband and I were upset, we fully supported her and thought she was strong for making a tough decision. 

She’s doing well now and is married with kids. Her husband knows about the child she gave away for adoption. 

A while ago, we heard from her daughter (S) that she gave away. Our granddaughter contacted us sobbing that her adoptive family had given her away as a baby and she was in the foster system with an abusive family. She’s 12 years old. 

My husband and I agreed that even though L didn’t want her, she’s still our grandchild and we have the resources to help her. We adopted S and she now lives with us. 

We got S a new wardrobe and redid our guest room to be her room. We also made a college fund and put about $60k in it. Basically we treat her like how we treated L, S is now our daughter by law and in our hearts. 

L was indifferent to us adopting S. However, L went ballistic when we told her about S college fund. We didn’t think L would mind since we paid $80k a year for her college education and S is now our daughter too. L is mad because her other kids don’t get a college fund from us even though L and her husband have already gotten it taken care of. But, L says that we are spending more on S and aren’t treating the grandkids equally. She says that her kids will resent us and L for not being treated like S. 

However, S is our daughter now and L’s kids are our grandchildren. S has no support system besides us and we treat her just like L. We don’t discriminate among our grandchildren and if L had taken in S, she would’ve been treated like the other kids, aka no college fund. 

AITA?

Edit: Thank you for the kind words! I’m so happy about all the well wishes that my S has gotten. I’ve been getting a lot of messages about this, but we weren’t the first people S contacted. S contacted L first (not sure exactly how she got the contact info but I remember it being an open adoption). S wanted to know more about her family and L thought that we were the best people that S could find answers from. L did tell her why she gave S up, but told her that it was a hard decision she made a long time ago and that she’s not sure if she’d be able to take S again. I’m not sure if S has her birth fathers information or called him. She knows about him and the circumstances though.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I back out of donating my kidney to my ex-fiancee’s brother after my ex-fiancee and I broke up?,"For five years I dated a girl I’ll call Mia. We got engaged last March and were supposed to get married next year, but two weeks ago I learned that our entire relationship was a lie. Someone showed me a dashcam recording of her saying that she still loves her ex and she was only with me because I’m the better choice. I confronted her, she admitted it was true, I called off the wedding and broke up with her.

I’m determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that I should have achieved had Mia not wasted five years of my life. But there’s an issue that has me on the fence: I was supposed to donate my kidney to Mia’s brother Tom, and now I don’t know if I should do it.

Tom has ESRD and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. I’m not that close to him and I was only going to do it because I wanted to help Mia’s family in any way I could because I though they were going to be m family. But now that I know that she was just playing me the whole time, I’m having second thoughts. Organ donation is a big deal, I will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point I don’t want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

AITA for helping my girlfriend’s maid clean?,"I’m visiting my girlfriend’s family for the first time and they’re kind of rich.

They have a maid who comes and tidies up for a bit every day. 

My family isn’t broke, but we’ve never had people working for us, and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can’t imagine if my mom were witnessing that. She’d flip. 

So I got up and started to help her tidy up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn’t have to worry about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn’t, we were just sitting watching TV.) 

Later that night my girlfriend’s parents asked me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she’s paid well and has been with them a long time. 

The next day it happened again and it made me so uncomfortable I said “hey let’s go outside” to my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn’t help it, I had to jump up and help her out. 

Her parents walked in and looked pissed and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside. 

I’m still so confused by the situation. I’m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping her clean or if I’m in the wrong now for not helping her. 

My instinct is to help, but when I do people get pissed, so, if you understand the dynamic better than me, please clear this up.

AITA for taking my birth control in public?,"I’ve been taking oral contraceptives for about 6 years now. When I first started, I was worried about what other people would think (I was raised in a pretty “sex-is-taboo” household) and hid that I was taking them very well. Now, however, I’m in my mid twenties and I’m comfortable enough in my skin that I don’t really mind if people know I’m on the pill. 

Anyway, I was out on a double date with a couple we know last night and the alarm on my watch started going off (vibration). It was time for me to take my pill. While we’re all chatting, I reach down into my purse that’s beside me in the booth and get my pill, put it in my mouth, and take a drink of water. Whole thing probably took 30 seconds. 

My friend didn’t comment, but her boyfriend made a face and said “did you just take something?”

I said “yeah, my birth control.”

He made another face and said, “that’s inappropriate don’t you think?”

I just kind of exchanged a look with my boyfriend who seemed as lost as I was. I mumbled an “uh, ok” cause I hate confrontation. 

He went on, “you should probably go to the bathroom to do that. It’s really not polite to take that kind of pill in front of a group of people. We get it, you have sex.”

I really had no idea what to say, so my boyfriend changed the subject to the game that was on over our heads at the bar and the night carried on. 

I was pretty much floored. Wtf? I had been doing this for a while now, any time I’m out and my alarm goes off, I’ll just take my pill and go about my day. Wouldn’t it be like taking any other medication? Or Advil? I don’t really see the problem. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?,"I found out I was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

During my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that I was making dumb decisions"". When I spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

Which brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated ""as an independent adult"". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

I pick her up from school or dance practice sometimes when her parents are working.

She said “I smell?” And I said “Yah, just a little. No big deal. Just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some.” 

Her parents called and were furious saying she’s going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare I make her insecure about her natural bodily functions. 

I said “Sorry, I thought if roles were reversed I’d want someone to tell me. Are you really saying you didn’t notice her smelling like BO all the time?” 

They said she had to come to them and ask for it because someone pushing the issue would make her insecure. And by circumventing her psychological timeline I’ve given her a complex for the rest of her adolescence, maybe beyond.

"AITA for not wanting my flat to be ""kink-friendly"" and potentially getting my flatmates evicted.","So i'm 20(M) and have just moved in with three people at uni. Sarah, Joey and Michelle. Fake names obviously.

Sarah and Joey are dating and part of a fairly sizeable fetish community locally and they go to a lot of gatherings and are generally fairly openly kinky. Grand, you do you, go nuts.

We moved in together for the upcoming year and all was going pretty well until two days ago when I came home and Michelle immediately pulled me into her room to explain that Sarah and Joey had put up a ton of LGBT and Fetish related flags all over the living room (side note TIL about fetish pride flags, there are a lot of them). They are only those little hand sized flags but they're in a big chain thing across one wall of the living room. 

Then there's some ""art"". It's just close up pictures of genitals that I am 100% certain include the two of them and the other people from their little club.

Then there's a shelf that used to have a couple of tiny cactii on it that now has a leather mask, riding crop, and condom bowl. 

I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we were both obviously beyond uncomfortable with the entire situation. 

We sat Joey and Sarah down and told them we were uncomfortable and it all had to go. They said it was unfair because it was their lifestyle and they wanted people who came over to the flat to know it was ""a kink friendly place to be yourself"" for any guests or additional partners that might come over and that the living room shouldn't be a place of oppression (unless it's consensual).

I said it absolutely fucking wasn't and the only ""kink friendly place to be yourself"" was your private spaces, and that the living room wasn't a place for sex when it's shared. 

They feel like they'd made their lifestyle clear before we moved in and that the living room is shared and therefore they can do what they like in it. 

Michelle and I explained the situation to the housing company we're living in and asked if we could break the lease and move into a two bed together. The manager we spoke to went *nuts* and screamed at Joey and Sarah that he wanted them out and was going to contact his lawyer. I think he's under the impression that they're going to have loads of people over for sex parties all the time and we can only have a limited number of guests. Also that it's disgusting.

We end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I’m basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They’re still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

At this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn’t seen this guy in ages. I tell her that’s cool but I’m just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn’t have a ride and it’s far from home. 

So I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I’m going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I’m going and she holds up a finger like “wait a minute” and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend.

AITA for telling my best friend that I'm not happy for her,"I dated my ex-boyfriend for a few years and we broke it off a few months before covid. We were both madly in love and I'm still not over him. My best friend knows this.

A few months ago, she started getting distant from me and it's super unusual for me because she needs me for EVERYTHING. Like just a few things that I helped her do: find colleges, apply to colleges, help donate money for her college fund, help her build her resumé, find her therapy, find her a job, and countless other things. I even paid for a lot of stuff for her, like going on trips and such. She didn't really do much for me and was somewhat of an emotional support because we'd always talk about her, but then I really didn't mind and didn't care what I did for her. She was my BFF and you love ur best friends. They're sisters.

Last month, she broke and told me that the reason that she's so distant is because she's quarantining with my ex and they're a thing. Whatever hopes I had of getting back to my ex are squashed because I don't think I can get over him hooking up with my best friend.

I'm super heartbroken and I know that you don't own people, but that doesn't mean that you can't be upset about their betrayal. Yes, dating your best friend's ex that she still loves is a betrayal.

She asked me if I was happy for her (wtf??) because she finally got a good job and a nice boyfriend. That job she has is solely because of me because I asked an old acquaintance to return a favor by hiring my best friend. He wanted to hire someone else, but I begged him to hire her.

I know how people are sometimes hurt but then they say ""..but I'm truly happy for you"". I honest to god don't think they mean it and when I say I'm happy for someone, I want to mean it. I'm not happy for my friend. I just am not. I can't make myself be. I told her as such and told her to stop contacting me. She's now blowing up my emails and DMs because she's so ""hurt"" by what I said to her.

My dad said that I should've just kept this to myself since I know my best friend is a sensitive person and is hurt. But what about me? Am I given a sensitivity pass because I've looked after my friend for so long. Do my feelings just stop mattering at some point?

EDIT: My conversation with my best friend went as followed: She called me with the news and said that she didn't know how to tell me (didn't apologize FYI) and then she followed it up with how she's finally doing well and doesn't have to rely on my for money since she has a nice job and also a nice boyfriend. I told her I was not happy for her. I reminded her that I got her the job (she knew and was fine with it) and that I've done so much for her over the years and she thanks me by backstabbing me and getting with my ex. She knew that it would hurt me and if she'd done it when I was well-over him or with my permission, I'd feel differently.

AITA for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?,"First of all, I know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

My girlfriend and I were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.

It's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

Honestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""What did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

This living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be.

AITA for buying my 5th property rather than help out my siblings?,"For context, even when I (44M) was a child I was incredibly into owning property and designing houses. I work as an architect and am doing quite well for myself. Bought my first duplex here in Germany along time ago where I rent out both part. Then I own two houses in Italy and one in Spain. Two of them are get rented out as Holiday homes while the last one I use for vacations and rent out a room to a friend of mine. So I have a lot of passive income at the moment, but only after a lot of time and money investments and refurbishing of these houses. (I rent in NYC at the moment as my job has moved made me move here temporarily).

My brother (48M) does an apartment. He has a family with two kids while my wife and I are childless. They are currently looking to purchase a house that fits all of them nicely. While they have found their dream house, its out of budget for them. Meanwhile, my wife and I are about to buy our 5th house, this time in France. It's going to be one of our largest purchases yet, significantly larger than anything else we have done. Its a great deal on the property however, and ideally what my wife and I want to retire in.

When having a family facetime with my siblings and parents, I brought it up. Initially very happy for me, my brother mentioned how he needs a larger home for his family and how I should give up on this opportunity to give him money for his house and spend the rest on refurbishing their new home. I just laughed and said flat out no. (Edit: Thought this was a joke)

This was apparently the wrong move, my entire family turns against me and starts berating me. After 10 minutes of them taking turns telling me to buy my brother a house, I said I'd think about it and left.

I am a bit of a pushover so after talking to my wife we agreed we could wait and buy their house and rent it out to them at no profit. Apparently this was insulting to him, having his younger brother be his landlord and my parents said I should just outright give him the money we have been saving.

I told em to piss off, and started moving forward with the paperwork on our house in France. After talking to my friends, they said I should put family first and its not like we are struggling for money.

Now I am confused, AITA?

EDIT: This edit is super late but I want to clarify my brother DOES have money for a 4 bedroom house. He isn't broke. Just not enough money for his dream house. The dream house is approximately double as expensive.

AITAH For kicking my friend out because of breastfeeding?,"I had some friends over, one (m) with his wife, the other 3 (f). One of the (f) we'll call Jane had a baby 2 months ago and this is the first time that we have seen her. She was away at family's when she had her baby so this was a small unplanned baby shower for her. 

After an hour or so her baby got fussy and she started breast feeding her baby. One of the friend we'll call her rb (rude bich) started looking up set and asked ""Don't you think you should cover up especally since there is a man here?"" 

We all just kind of looked at her. My male friend said it's ok his wife breastfeeds. And his wife nods her head. Well this upset rb and looked towards me and said to get a blanket. So I got her one and she said no it's to cover up with."" So I did as she asked and opened up the blanket all the while all the other people were giving me a strang look and I covered rb head and sat back down.

Rb got mad and took it off and said not that Jane needs to cover I said what for. Rb get's up and tries to put the blank on Jane I finally had enough and said if she didn't like seeing some one breast feed then she can either look away or leave. Yeah she got mad saying how I am chosing Jane over her and that she known me longer. I told her that you should known by now that I don't belive in covering up regardless of where you are at and that it's my house. I also told her that she knows what a pain it is trying cover pop a breast in a screaming wiggle babys mouth so have a nice day. 

so yeah she is mad at me but the rest of us had a good time visiting.

So witah maybe for putting the blanket on rb head lol",Not the A-hole
AITA for saying ‘what did she expect’ when my girlfriend told me her best friend’s affair partner has vanished into thin air when she told him she was pregnant?,"I’ve been with my girlfriend coming up to 1 year now. Her best friend has been having a 3 month affair with a married man. She knows he is married. 

She found out she was pregnant a month back and he has completely disappeared into thin air. He has blocked or deleted her from tinder and she never got his real name (they both went by aliases) and now she is desperately searching for him on Facebook but nothing even in the ballpark has come up. 

The guy offered her abortion money and offered to go with her. She refused because she has a 3 y/o and she wants a sibling for her baby. 

I can’t say I didn’t see him disappearing. He’s a piece of shit coward for having an affair in the first place and so of course he’s gonna abscond from a pregnancy from his side chick too. From my perspective it’s fairly obvious he was using my girlfriends friend and she should have either known that or have been prepared to deal with the consequences. 

My girlfriend is very worried about her friend and keeps talking to me about it and asking what I think even though I’ve made it clear I don’t approve of either of their trashy behavior. I told her ‘well what did she expect?’ She keeps asking me if I think ‘as a man’ is it possible he will come back. I said hell no. Sometimes especially within the context of a couple talking let’s be frank we won’t always be politically correct. 

She flipped her shit and said that my attitude towards her pregnant friend is misogynistic and I’m being heartless. I don’t think I am and I feel I’m allowed to have an obvious opinion such as that.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. 

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't ""get my act together"". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

WIBTA if I tell my girlfriend she needs to bring her own food to my house and pay for the food she has eaten?,"I want to start off by saying I love my girlfriend and I’m scared that if I give her this rule or expectation it will make her feel unwelcome at my home. We have been dating for awhile now and she’s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn’t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn’t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn’t eat much since she’s smaller but I didn’t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can’t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me’s so often though since she’s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don’t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she’s always making sure I’m taken care of and comfortable. I don’t know if I should just suck it up because she’s not taking much from me and if I’d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?

Edit: wow. I think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought “haha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!”, saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. All within 20 minutes of making this post! She thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel’s back.

Edit2: to answer some repeated questions: I made this as a throwaway account. The account name is based off a pretty popular band (Joyce Manor) I like so, I didn’t think she would realize it was me. I’m 26 and she’s 20. Her name is not Joyce. I don’t think she’ll come on here to give her side of the story.

AITA for not wanting to lie about having a baby with a lesbian?,"I (30m) had a son with my ex when we were teenagers (we were 15 and 16) my son is about to turn 15 in May. We did not intend on having a child that young, but we decided to make it work. It was a wonderful decision & I love my son so much. Our relationship did not last, as my ex realized she was gay a couple years after our son was born. We ended on good terms, and currently split custody of my son. My son stays with me and my girlfriend (29f) during the week, and his mother and her wife on the weekends. 

   My girlfriend and I just moved in together recently, and I have just began to get close with her family recently as well. My girlfriend and son get along very well, but my girlfriend wants me to lie about the situation I have with my son. 

For context, my girlfriend's family is very religious (jehovah's witness) and while she is not as religious as they are, she fears they will judge me or ""not like me"" when they find out that I had a child with a lesbian who is very involved in my son's life.  She also told me they would be uncomfortable with the fact that I had a child outside of wedlock. 

   My girlfriend's suggestion was to lie, and tell her parents (if it ever came up) that I was previously married to my son's mother, and that she left me, or PASSED AWAY, and to absolutely not mention the lesbian part. I don't feel comfortable lying about my son for several reasons: 

\- I love this woman, and I want any love her family has for me to be based on authenticity. 

\- I do not want to set the precedent for my son that lying is acceptable to make people like you.

\-I do not believe it is wrong to be gay, and I won't tip-toe around it in order to spare feelings. 

\- My son is a valid & legitimate person whose story matters, and I won't erase that because it is a little different than most people.

My girlfriend is really upset with me, and says that it isn't a big deal, and that my son doesn't even need to know. She is hesitant to let me spend time with her parents now & after this stay-at-home order is over.

"AITA for child locking my aunt, and then leaving her at a gas station?","My (16f) aunt (33f) lives with my family. She has me drive her around, and refuses to sit in the front passenger seat because she wants to act like it’s a taxi/chauffeur situation, which is shitty of her, but I haven’t said anything.

The other day we were driving through a restaurant drive through, and it was packed. The parking lot was full. My aunt got out of the car while we were in the drive through, and I asked what the fuck she was doing. She told me she was “getting claustrophobic”, and I told her to stay in the car so she doesn’t get hit by another car. (My reasoning for saying this is she wanted to walk close to the actual road to smoke, where traffic’s busy. y’know; normal road.)

She ignored me and got out anyway, so when I pulled up to the drive through window, I got out and put child lock on the back doors. I did this because my aunt has done this several times before, has almost gotten hit when she does it, and once had her foot run over by a car because she does it. (Which, btw, she blamed on me even though another car ran over her foot...)

I got our food, my aunt gets back in, we get on the main road, it’s a traffic jam. My aunt tries getting out of the car again, and finds that she’s child locked. She starts screaming and cussing at me, calling me a little mother fucker and screaming at me to let her out. So when we could pull over again, I pulled over, let her out, and told her she could call someone else for a ride home. (I left her at a gas station)

I got home and my parents asked where my aunt was. I explained what happened, my mom told me I was in the right, and my dad flipped his shit. He told me to go out and pick her back up, and I told him to pick her up himself, because I’m done driving her around because she acts like a toddler. He decided it was appropriate to call me a spoiled bitch before leaving to pick her up.

AITA for child locking my aunt, and then leaving her at a gas station?

Info: The “traffic jam” I mentioned: One lane stopped, while the one right next to it kept moving. People were actively moving and getting into the lane that wasn’t stopped. 

Also: no, my aunt doesn’t have a mental disability. She’s just been spoiled by her parents and my dad. And yes, she is my dad’s sister.

Also also: My dad made a deal with me to get the car. I saved up $2,000 as a “down payment” for the car, and he’d make monthly payments of $200 to the guy we bought the car from. Or so he tells me. At this point in time, I have paid more for the car than he has, as I’ve only had it for four months. And yes, I work (or rather worked... I got laid off back when everything shut down)

Second edit for info: I didn’t leave her stranded. She had her phone, and if she chose not to call someone, that’s on her.

Also: You know how some people go really fast in a residential neighborhood? Apply that to the restaurant’s parking lot. People get really mad/fast in chick-fil-a parking lots for some reason.

Also also (again): I’m in America. We get our licenses at 16, and I’m almost 17.

And yes, I pay for my own gas to drive dear auntie around. My dad, the one who called me a spoiled bitch, raised me not to expect anything to just be handed to me. If I were out of gas on a back road, he would leave me there and tell me to figure it out. (This is from experience.)",Not the A-hole
AITA for not helping my husband babysit?,"I never wanted kids. The idea of family is very suffocating to me and I was never willing to date a man with children. When i met my husband he said he didn't have any and didn't want any. A year later when he was drinking he admitted that he had gotten his high school girlfriend pregnant when they were both 18 and begged her to abort but she hadn't wanted to so he had a son who he had never met and he had signed away his parental rights. I was annoyed that he lied but I 100% believe that men have the right to walk away.

When my stepson was sixteen his mother passed away and he found my husband's contact information from an old friend. I completely supported my husband taking him and stepping up, and I actually really liked him. We have a good friendship, but obviously he doesn't view me as a parent. He married the most annoying woman ever and they have three children.

He recently asked if we would be able to babysit overnight so they could go to a wedding. My husband agreed and I reminded everyone I don't babysit. My husband said it would be fine and I didn't need to help. Well that lasted about ten minutes, because my husband does not know what to do with children and was begging for me to help. His DIL gave him a list of rules and things they aren't allowed to eat, so he was in a pissy mood over that and once the kids actually started running around and making noise he couldn't handle it and expected me to step in.

Well I didn't. I'm actually a terrible person and let them have water guns, so my husband ended up throwing a tantrum and locking himself in the bedroom. I did make sure the children didn't die, but like I stated to everyone involved, I do not babysit. They got into food they weren't supposed to have (no allergies) and didn't sleep at all, but they are alive. DIL is furious with me, because I'm the woman and I am apparently responsible, and my husband is off sulking.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not making my son share is gaming PC?,"I am 45F and my Husband 50M has a 16-year-old son. He is a good kid, good grades, respectful, does his chores, etc. Last Summer my son said that he wanted a new computer. To his credit, he got a part-time job and saved up for it, and built a pretty nice gaming PC. We are really proud of him, as he saved for it nearly all summer.

My sister and her husband have recently moved in with us. They have a 9-year-old son. My sister has a history of IDK how to put it, being entitled. She thinks her kid can do no wrong and spoils her kid.

Well when they came over, my nephew noticed my son's PC. He asked if he can play on it, my son said not now. That was the end of it for a couple of days. Again, my nephew wanted to play on it. I asked my son if he minded sharing, he said he would rather not since its expensive and doesn't want it to break. This has caused a big argument. My sister says its extremely unfair to my nephew because he doesn't have a system to play on, just his iPad, so my son should have to share. I told her it's his PC not mine, he paid for it so it's up to him. She then accused me of being a 'spineless parent'. I said I'm not, but I'm not going to force my son to share his own computer. My nephew ended up having a huge fit, which she then blamed me for his fit, but gave him 3 more hours of iPad time to quiet him down.

Its been 4 days and my sister hasn't brought it up directly again, just being passive-aggressive. While on one hand, I don't want to make my kid share, because it's his computer, he saved up for it and I don't feel it would be the right thing to do, to force my kid to share. On the other hand, I do feel kinda bad for my nephew, AITA?

AITA for not telling a bunch of random women I’m gay?,"So I (23M, turning 24 soon) am gay. I’ve been out since I was 18 and I’ve never hidden it, but I don’t like actively mention it or broadcast it cos it’s literally nobody’s business. The first person I came out to was my dad (40) and he has always been supportive of me. He was 16 when I was born and practically raised me as a single dad so we have an exceptionally close relationship. Anyway onto the story.

My dad recently turned 40, only earlier this month. He had a huge party and drank a bit too much and was severely hungover the following morning. He’s a freelance photographer and had accepted a contract with a local business and was meant to hand in some photography work he’d done to them the morning after his birthday. He was too hungover to do so, so he asked if I’d do it, he called their office to tell them he was sending his son with the work and I went in.

Everything was fine and I ended up meeting a bunch of people he’s currently working with. They knew I was my dad’s son as he talks about me with them. I got some conversation with them to be nice and a few of the younger women started I guess flirting with me? A few of them called me attractive and stuff like that and I kinda just stood there awkwardly. It was just wild that straight women were hitting on me. I didn’t encourage it or anything but I didn’t say anything as I was too embarrassed and I eventually said I had to run and off I went.

My dad went in the day after and he was questioned about if I was single. He said no, I wasn’t and that I had a boyfriend and that was all he said. Well, turns out these women then started blatantly calling me for an AH as I apparently let them embarrass themselves by openly hitting on me when there was no chance I’d ever be interested. My dad did fight my corner and said that I was literally there to just drop off his work and that I had no obligation to disclose I was gay.

I’m thankful my dad’s on my side but these women calling me an AH kinda makes me feel bad for not saying anything.

AITA for letting my date pay for dinner?,"I [19M] asked a girl [18F] out to dinner. When it was time to pay, she said ""I got it"" and went into her purse. At that point I literally had the receipt thing in my hand. I thanked her and handed it to her. She hesitated a bit, but she paid and we went home happy (or so I thought).

So from my perspective I really can't see what I did wrong here. From asking her out until receiving the check, I intended to pay. After she offered to pay, I thanked her and allowed her to pay.

The next day I woke up to angry texts. She said I put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. I asked what she wanted me to do differently. Apparently I should have argued/insisted that I would pay. My friends agree with her. Now I'm wondering if I should just apologize and pay her back.

AITA for inviting my atheist friends only for the wedding party and not the ceremony?,"Edit: didnt expect this to be a reason to be called a ""child molestator cultist"" but I suppose that's reddit for you?

I am getting married in a few months. We have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so I thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. My future wife and both of our families are Roman Catholic. Catholic ceremonies are *long*. I'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble.

Anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time. 

Was it an asshole move?


Edit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between us. 

- those who I decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",Asshole
AITA for telling my mom she's the reason I don't want any kids?,"I (23F) am the oldest of 4 siblings. My dad passed away when I was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

There's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an hour or so on chores. 

Now I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

I'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

When she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking) i told her ""Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" I didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

She cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. 

AITA?

Edit: When I said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" I wasn't trying to be malicious. 
A) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why I had to. 
B) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

I wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why I said it that way.

Edit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. I'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and I don't want kids because of that.

Edit 3: For the people PMing and commenting about how it's my fault I didn't have friends and not my mom's: I wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

Last edit: For everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

Actually the last edit: My mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean I only watched the kids till 06:30. I usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",Not the A-hole
AITA for terrorising my roommates into cleaning up their crap?,"So I live with two roommates (28m & 21f) who are less than helpful when it comes to cleaning the house. 

Wet clothes are left in the washer for days on end, food is left rotting in the fridge and in the sink for several weeks if I do not clean it, they also just casually throw garbage into the yard. If asked nicely multiple times for them to clean their mess and even not so nicely a few times. 

I am far from the most hygienic person in the world myself, I’ll leave dishes until the next day and just general untidiness but they take it to a different level. 

All this filth (since my refusal to clean it anymore) has brought some new roommates for us, mainly giant ass rats! Which seem to have moved into our yard. 

The kicker is, they are both ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of rats. 

A plan soon hatched in my mind and with a bit of creativity, some invisible thread and an old bristle broom, I now had a “faux rat” (I named him Ronald)

Every few days or so for the past 2weeks ish I have been placing it in the corner of the kitchen, waiting for one of them to walk in. Then I yank Ronald as hard as I can at an angle so he shoots towards them. Each time they’ve ran from the kitchen screaming in fear. 
I won’t lie I very much enjoyed doing it at first but kinda felt guilty at having made a grown man bawl his eyes out and thought the lesson has probably been learned. 

So I decided  we had to have a house meeting about the infestation and how they don’t feel safe in the home anymore (personally I didn’t feel safe with a pan of veggie rice rotting on the countertop for 12days but hey ho!).

I simply stated that if they’re just cleaned up their junk the rats would most likely disappear. 

Lo and behold the place was spotless within an hour and since then there has been a lot less mess. 

Ronald has been put into retirement and is resting in my bedroom ready to pounce if ever needed again.

AITA for not accommodating a vegan guest?,"Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we’ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it’s become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn’t push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don’t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don’t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don’t believe it’s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for splitting off my knitting club and joining a second one to escape mommy talk?,"About 2 years ago, I (36F) started a club through a meetup site. It was for women to get together and do stuff like knit/crochet/sew/embroider/bead. It started slow but ramped up and became a bi-weekly thing. I became fairly close with a number of people and considered them friends. 

As time went on and new people joined, others moved away, things shifted in the club. A lot of new or expecting mothers joined the group. Conversations in the meetups would eventually turn back to being about kids, no matter what other conversations were going on. Someone would be talking about their job, and one of the moms would find a way to steer the conversation to her daughter's grades. 

Me and a few others would try to redirect conversation, encourage quiet folks to speak up, etc. At one point, a very cool new person joined, Amy, and during the last 2/3 of the meetup, she said something like ""I didn't realize this was a Mom group.""

They all laughed about it, but Amy didn't comeback. I sent her a message through the meetup app and asked her about it, because I thought she was a great addition, and she said she just wasn't into ""Mommy group stuff."" 

Explaining the whole story to her, she offered me a solution: Just let them have their Mommy group, and split off and make a new one. I felt bad because some of those women were really nice, but just... I don't care *that much* about your kids! I'm sorry! A lighthearted anecdote here or there, sure! But I started to dread going to the meetups because it would always, always end up about their kids. 

So Amy started a new club, and advertised it, and I told a few other members of my group that I knew were tired of being bulldozed. We scheduled it differently and I continued to attend my old group a few more times until I said I was handing it off to another woman, and stepping away. I didn't give any reason, didn't lie, etc. 

Well about three months later, they found out. Probably saw it on the meetup app. Boy, it didn't go over well. I got confronted by one of the Moms and told I was ""unfeminist"" and ""not family friendly"" and judgmental and a kid-hater. 

I ended up saying ""Look, I get that this hurt your feelings, and I'm sorry. But the old group just became something different than I intended, and despite trying to shift it, I felt like splitting off and forging a new group was the best choice for everyone. Now you guys can talk about your kids, and we can talk about other things.""

She ended up slamming me on Instagram & FB, trying to make it into a big crusade, but it kind of flopped.

I still grapple with feeling bad about it. I think I was right, and I tried to be polite about it, but it obviously hurt someone's feelings badly enough to be this angry at me for this long.

"AITA for being a ""Karen"" about my car being ""fixed""?","My car was shaking when I braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and I believed him but the deal I got the car from has free diagnostic so I took it there. 

So my dad was right, it was the rotors. My friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. So the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). I said ok. 

He calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

He calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like ""I was just tryna to help you out""


I'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. It's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). I pay and leave. My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. We get into and he's like I'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. I tell him I'll get a lawyer cause I'm not giving him literally another penny, I paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


I ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. Pick the car up the next day and it's good. 


I told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said I was a ""karen""

AITA for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?,"I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

However, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

Recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

This really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

Also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

On the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my parents that they shouldn’t have had three kids?,"I’m (23F) the youngest in my family with two older sisters, A (27F) and M (26F). In general, I’ve always felt my sisters were raised differently than me. They’re only a year and ten months apart, so they were only one grade apart in school and much closer than they were with me growing up. They got to do all the same activities together, hung out with the same friend groups, and got to travel together once they were both in college. However, I was just the ‘little sister’ that they didn’t want around growing up. For instance, I was literally kicked out of the house during M’s 16th birthday because I was still in middle school and they thought it’d be weird if I was there at the party (still had to clean up their mess when the party was over!). 

Anyway, my sisters got to do a lot of cool activities that I didn’t get to do when I was growing up. They got to do ice skating, horseback riding lessons, all these cool summer camps, etc. Growing up, all I did was sit at their lessons and wait for them to be over. The only activity I had was tennis for a year and a half before my parents canceled it. When my sisters left for college, my parents kind of checked out and didn’t really care I was still in high school. I was pretty much just doing everything on my own. When they got older, my dad bought A three cars (over the course of 5 years) and my mom bought M a car. When I was old enough to drive, my parents said they didn’t have enough money to buy me a car, so I had to finance my first car. My parents even helped them out with rent during college, car insurance, and any other expense. However, I have been pretty much supporting myself since I was 17. 

Today, my sisters are both married with kids. A has two kids and M has one. My mom looks after all the kids while my sisters are working. Meanwhile, I’m in grad school very far away from my family. Anyway, my mom has been complaining how she can’t handle watching 3 kids under the age of 2 at the same time, and has been bugging me to quit school to come help out watching the kids, which pissed me off because it feels like it’s just me revolving my life around my sisters again. She was also pointing out how A has saved up enough money to buy a house which they don’t see me doing at  her age cause I haven’t been saving as much as her (A was living at home until 3 months ago and didn’t pay for anything).That’s when I pretty much snapped and told her that maybe if they treated me equally as them financially, then perhaps I’d be buying a house at 27 as well. She started going on about how it was difficult raising 3 kids, and I told her that she shouldn’t have 3 kids if she couldn’t handle it and treat all 3 equally. My mom got really upset and hung up the phone and hasn’t really reached out to me since. I do feel kind of bad now though because they did provide me food and shelter growing up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for singling someone out at a comedy show?,"I do stand up. I also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

I mentioned at work that I couldn’t do any shifts after 4:00 on Saturday because I had a show. My coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

I had no problem helping him out and I knew this club wouldn’t care if I slid a couple people in. But I’ve been trying to get more bookings at this place and it’s kind of a level up from the sort of places I usually get to perform at so I told them, you know, “please make a point to laugh.”

I’m up there doing my show and I see them and they’re the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren’t laughing. It bugs me a little but I didn’t want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. Then I see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

So I start telling a joke about a time I gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as I’m doing it I’m slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes I’m talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn’t notice or look up until I’m literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

It killed, so that was the good part. But when I showed up to work I was expecting an apology from him. Instead HE was expecting an apology from me for (I’m quoting here) “inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke” “making him look like a fool in front of his girl” and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

He basically summarized it as “you’re supposed to be a professional and if you couldn’t handle me texting you shouldn’t be in show business.”

I think, without question, that he’s the asshole. But he doesn’t believe me and the only people I could tell this story to and ask to confirm I’m not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. 

Who’s the asshole?

AITA for not letting my classmate use my artwork for her GoFundMe?,"I’m a senior in HS. In December one of my classmates got into a bad car accident that did a lot of damage. She had several surgeries, and is in need of more for her face. Her insurance won’t cover it, hence the GoFundMe. 

I was never friendly with this girl. She spread nasty rumors about a friend of mine, and I always had a tainted view of her. Outside of that incident I never talked to her, and didn’t know she knew that I existed. 

So my classmates are sending around a GoFundMe and a link to T-shirts for sale and I see that my artwork has been used! 

My artwork has nothing to do with her cause, it was a Picasso style self portrait that was an assignment for class. I posted it to twitter. They were using it on T-shirts and in promotions without my permission.

I got into contact with the girl and her friend who is running everything and asked them to take my artwork off of their GoFundMe. At first they said that they didn’t know it was mine, and would credit me (they cropped my siggy out though...) I told them that I didn’t want it credited and preferred it to be taken down. 

The told me they already had T-shirts, people recognized it for her GoFundMe. I honestly didn’t care. Then they started guilt tripping me about it, and I told them I would go through other means to get it taken down. 

Then the girl posts screenshots of our DMs on her twitter, directing people at me, and telling them how heartless I am. I am getting tons of hate messages, and people telling me to just “let her use my shitty artwork.” I can’t even open up any social media without fear of getting shitty messages from my classmates.

I talked to my mom about it and she thinks I should have just kept quiet about it as it’s hard not to look like an asshole for refusing to let her use the image. I’m feeling pretty confused, because I think I have the right to say where my artwork goes. AITA for not letting her use my art?",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking for the gift receipt to return offensive baby clothes?,"Yesterday we had a baby shower. Long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. For example: 

* ""All daddy wanted was a blow job"" 
* ""I'm with the milf"" 
* ""To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties"" 

There were like 2 more but I don't remember what they said. When I opened the gift I was humiliated, I thought it was really inappropriate. Before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. The person basically called me oversensitive and said I needed to take a joke. I handed the gift bag back to them and said ""Alright, well then you can keep these."" They were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for being upset my MIL won't make a ""family quilt"" for me and my husband because we have no kids?","My MIL has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",Asshole
AITA for “period shaming” my daughter?,"I’m a 41M single dad with a 13 year old daughter Lacey. My wife died in childbirth and it’s just been me and Lacey all her life. My sister has been a big help in raising Lacey, and we do keep in contact with her maternal grandparents. 

The issue started a couple of months ago when Lacey started her period. I knew this day would come so I spoke to my sister, my female best friend and my mother in law to be well prepared. I gave her the talk with her grandmother and aunt there, I buy her pads and tampons, I even have midol and heating pads ready for Lacey when she needs them. 

The problem began when I began to notice a smell coming from Lacey’s room. I went in to investigate and found pads and tampons openly disposed of in her wastebasket. I checked her bathroom and it was worse. She had her bloodstained undergarments in the tub.

I took out her trash and did my best to get rid of the smell, but I didn’t know what to do with the underwear in the tub. Later, I noticed bloodstains on the couch. It took a while of cleaning but I got them out. I figured that was the end of that.

It happened again last month, when I noticed Lacey’s room was stinking again. And I saw she didn’t even wash the underwear from before. The bathroom was unbearable at this point. Then earlier this week, I saw bloodstains on the couch again.

I sat Lacey down and told her that she had to learn to properly dispose of her feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. And to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. I also noticed her sheets had a lot of bloodstains and brought this up too. I also let her know that it was okay to get blood on things as long as she washed them, and I wouldn’t be upset if I saw her bloodstained items being washed.

Lacey immediately blew up at me saying that periods aren’t gross and that I was period shaming and that I needed to educate myself on menstruation. I then got texts from my sister and MIL scolding me for making Lacey feel ashamed of her bodily functions. 

But I honestly wasn’t trying to convey that periods are gross. I was trying to convey that her hygiene needed to be addressed and that the smell was becoming unbearable. I just wanted to make sure that Lacey knew how to properly dispose of pads and tampons without it smelling, and that I wouldn’t be annoyed if she washed her bloodstained items 

AITA here? Was I period shaming my daughter?

EDIT:  so I’ve mentioned it in a few comments. I talked to my sister and mil and explained my side. They apologized for misunderstanding and like you guys, have given some good cleaning tips and they’ll talk to Lacey and help her out with the pads and tampons too

EDIT2: so many people here have suggested it and I’ve asked Lacey if her period pain is unbearable or just normal cramps, and left the choice to her as to whether or not she wants to see a specialist but the option is there for her!

EDIT3: We have washed the sheets with hydrogen peroxide and purchased some oxyclean for future instances should we need it. Many of you have also suggested period underwear, which again, I have asked her aunt and grandmother about and they’ll be able to give her more info about those as well as different hygiene products she can use.",Not the A-hole
AITA for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?,"My ex (24f) and I (24m) dated 5 years ago. We were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. She and I shared the same circle of friends so I continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and I distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. I'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. I'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but I no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.

This past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. I have a new girlfriend (23f) that I have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. I never thought I could feel this way about someone). I invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.

At the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. She came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. I was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. She then says to my girlfriend, ""Hey did you know me and Ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""Yes, I'm aware"". Ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""Yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. My gf said ""Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex ""I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

She went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf. I told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me I could have been a little bit less harsh. Ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not paying for my siblings to go to uni?,"I'm 29f, my siblings are 19f, 19f(twins) and 17m. 

About a year ago I won a rather large amount of money. Since then I paid off my mortgage, bought a rental home, paid for my parents to spent 2 months on holiday, paid off their mortgage and bought each of my younger siblings either a car or(in the case of my brother) a motorbike. 

I have recently started planning my wedding to my partner of 4 years. Originally we were going to have a very low budget wedding because neither of us were particularly wealthy and have little financial support from our parents(hers are homophobic and mine are just not well off enough to spend money on a wedding), but now we plan on having a slightly bigger wedding. However during these discussions my mother has been getting increasingly upset at the amount im spending(wedding will be around 40-50k all up including honeymoon and partner is contributing 12k, so its not like we're spending an astronomical amount), and has repeatedly suggested that we stick to our low budget plans and give money to her for my siblings college funds instead. 

These comments have been confusing me because she has told me in the past that she got 20k when I was born to put towards my college fund from her parents and then 10k for each of my siblings. I got though college on scholarships and my part time job so presumably she has 50k already for my siblings college fund.

This came to a head about a week ago when she came with me to go to my fitting for my wedding dress and she saw the price tag($3k), she had a complete meltdown in the store about me wasting money and how she needed it and I confronted her about the college fund. She admitted that she and my dad had spent the money on trips away, alcohol and gambling a d now there was almost nothing left. I said if she wasted 50k meant for her children's college funds then why should I give her any more? At this point she stormed out after throwing her glass of wine on my dress(that cost $300 to clean) and has since said that she's not coming to my wedding and will stop my dad/siblings from coming.

WIBTA for eloping when the wedding is this weekend?,"My girlfriend and I had planned to get married on Saturday. We wrapped up all our planning around Halloween, all that was left was to ring some time this week and make sure everything was running smoothly.

She called the venue and the person she spoke to asked her to confirm some changes she'd apparently made. My girlfriend had no clue what he was talking about, and he reminded her of all the changes that had been put in recently. We had not approved any of these changes. We were able to get some of it put back the way it was but there are some things that we couldn't change back at such short notice.

The venue forwarded us the emails asking for the changes so we could look over them. Our communication was being done via an email account we created solely for wedding stuff, and the email address which asked for the changes is the exact same address, except 2 letters are switched round. The venue is very apologetic for not calling us directly but can only fix so much of it at this stage.

We think we know what happened. The whole time we were planning the wedding we got pushback from both sets of parents, and the stuff they had the biggest issues with have all been changed. I'm willing to bet that all of this was related to at least one of our respective parents. We don't know anyone who would want to fuck with us or the wedding this badly except our parents, who got pissy when we told them they couldn't financially contribute to the wedding because they were trying to trade their money for whatever wedding stuff they wanted.

Right now the stuff that we wanted that is still in this wedding is my suit, the venue and the DJ. My girlfriend has gone to pick up her dress and she's not heard from the shop so we're assuming that hasn't changed. I'm calling round everyone and it looks like the menu has been changed, as has the guest list and the cake. We paid for the wedding we'd planned and it looks like any additional costs from the changes (such as the extra people) were paid for by someone else, but they wouldn't give me any of the card info for legal reasons.

We probably won't be speaking to our parents again after this, unless one of them owns up in which case we'll just stop speaking to that one, but this feels like a joint effort as it's dealt with both sets of parent's complaints.

Before my girlfriend left to get the dress she gave me permission to post this as we are seriously considering eloping. We have the marriage certificate here, the honeymoon is unaltered and exactly what we wanted, and there's a few appointments we could make between now and Saturday at the town hall to get the certificate legally signed/filed.

However, we now have around 200 people attending this wedding in 3 days (our original guest list was about 100 including families and plus ones). People have booked hotels, planes, trains, and are coming from other countries to be here. None of these people have done anything to us and would be getting caught in the crossfire if we were to elope instead.

Would we be the arseholes?

Update: I posted in the group chat I have with all 4 parents that someone has been screwing with the wedding, we've found the email they used and we'd be tracking the IP address to a device and location (this was all absolute bullshit, we don't even know how to find an IP address). As soon as I said we'd be tracking the email they all started pointing fingers and accusing each other. It looks like all 4 of them were in on it together. Still not sure what we're doing about the wedding but all 4 parents are uninvited.

We're thinking that we might elope for the ceremony and then have the reception as planned (it's all the same party/venue and we won't get money back) because of the number of people who are coming from all over the place.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 2: My mother made up the email and her mother helped re-plan the wedding. We knew they'd been meeting for lunch but we didn't realise what they were doing in that time. Caterer and baker can fix the menu and cake, and the clothing is all safe. Venue think they might be able to fix the decorations and the parents have paid for the changes.

The ceremony itself is the same (we were worried it had been changed from a non religious ceremony to a religious one but it hadn't) so we'll probably just go through with the day as it currently stands, with a couple changes.

We've decided that we will meet up before the ceremony with some close friends (no parents) to sign the certificate so we're not doing it surrounded by strangers, then have the ceremony and rings as planned with everyone invited, go to the reception with everyone who has been invited because innocent people have paid out money to be here, and then afterwards we will go for drinks with the people who were at the signing earlier in the day.

The venue offered us security, but we're not going to uninvite the additional people or turn them away, and as for our parents, we're not sure. The options are either invite them and let them deal with their invitees so we don't have to, then cut them out of speeches and just don't acknowledge them all day and after the reception cut contact, or just don't let them come, in which case we will need the security the venue offered because I can't see them just not going.

Venue have also said to pretty much just leave it with them, they'll put what they can back to what we'd planned and they're prepared to offer a partial refund based on what they can't fix (so if they fix 50% of it, they're prepared to refund 25% for the 50% they can't fix)

&#x200B;

**FINAL UPDATE:**

**We had a small private thing where we signed the certificate with our closest friends, then we went to the planned ceremony and had a short service where we exchanged rings, followed by a reception.**

**We told the parents that they were not invited, told the venue they weren't invited, the venue put what was essentially a bouncer at the door, and they still got in. They don't seem to understand what they did wrong as they boasted to their guests that ""they planned this, but we changed it to what you're currently seeing"" and their own guests ended up being the ones to tell them how fucked up that was. They were pretty much shamed by their guests into leaving about an hour after they arrived. Also, half their guests didn't show, it was probably about 60-70% our guests in the end, and we definitely had the majority. Food (including cake) was sorted out but not decor, and venue are refunding us 50%, which was going to be 30%, but then they let the parents in.**

**We only spoke to them once to tell them that because after completely fucking up our wedding plans they then couldn't honour one simple request to not come, they would not be hearing from us, potentially ever again, and if they contacted us that would change to definitely never hearing from us again.**

**We are currently in the cab on our way to get drinks with the same friends who were at the signing earlier and then off on our honeymoon.**",Not the A-hole
AITA for not taking my girlfriend's side over a sexist tradition at a restaurant?,"I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year.

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter.

I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable. 

My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money.

We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that.

We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French.

I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US.

She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this.

She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way.

We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons.

AITA for climbing in the window of my dad's house? He changed the locks to keep my mom (divorced) out but I was supposed to be at his house for the weekend.,"My parents are divorced, and because of the custody agreement I am supposed to be at my dad's for every other week. My mom dropped me off outside his house and I went to the door and the key didn't work. I banged on the door and rang the doorbell and nobody came to the door, the house seemed empty. My phone had died and my mom had left because she was dropping me off in her rush to work. 

The locks on the doors were new but it was hot as hell out and my dad was supposed to have custody so I thought it would be fine to come in the window. Like I was supposed to be there.

I climbed in the bathroom window that he always leaves open, i slid the screen up carefully and came in without breaking anything. This is my childhood home, I've climbed in that window plenty of times, hell when I was little and playing outside I'd come through the window as a fun shortcut to use the bathroom.

I went towards my bedroom and there was some random lady in the hallway who freaked out, she was scared by me being there and I was like ""I live here, I'm Mitch's daughter, who the hell are you"" and she left the house without saying. I went around the house and my dad was not there. 

(EDIT - A few people asked why I was so rude to say ""who the hell are you"" - it's because my dad has remarried, he has a wife who is away this month caring for her elderly parents... And I come home to see a random lady looking like she'd slept over the house coming out of my dad's room, wearing my dad's pajamas. It didn't look good, and that's why I was so angrily asking questions)

So he got home and he was mad as hell at me for ""breaking in"" and scaring a lady he was friends with. Apparently my mom and him had miscommunicated about drop-off time, he was supposed to meet us in the afternoon and give me a copy of the new keys. It was supposed to be after his ""lady friend"" had left. 

And I was like ""ok so it was your mistake and my moms mistake, why are you mad at me for coming in rather than sitting out in 95 degree heat for who knows how long. And he was just so mad that I acted ""threatining"" to his ""friend"", that she was scared by me banging on the door and screaming then suddenly showing up inside the house when she had no idea who I was. I said that if he's having ladies over, and they're over a father's house, they better damn well expect a kid around it they're pretty dumb.

AITA for ordering jalapeños on my pizza intentionally to stop my wife eating it?,"First up, I love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. I’m a big dude, I’m 6’4 and I’m always goddamned hungry. I’m a firefighter so I’m always on my feet and simply put, I just love foooooood. My wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will ALWAYS help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it’s just the right amount of food that I want to eat but she’ll go ahead and take some. 

I’ve asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she’ll get really defensive and say ‘it’s just a little babe, you’ll be fine!’ Except I’m not fine, I’m hungry. And then when I’m hungry I get hangry and I snap at everyone cuz I’m goddamned hungry!

Things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. Wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so I gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst I held the goddamn plate and then when I went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

Lately my MIL gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can’t stand spicy food.  I tried that yesterday, I ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. She said no. I went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn’t eat it.

I told her I had to take drastic measures because I’m fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole.

AITA for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?,"I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My \[26M\] gf \[24F\] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.

**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.

He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.

**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",Asshole
AITA - Mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage,"I’m really upset with my wife after what she’s done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. So I’m posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

I’ve been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my “high school sweetheart” for well over a decade.

My late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn’t start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

I’ve always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

When I met my current wife she wasn’t comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it’s an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.

Over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she’d bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can’t she accept it’s very important to me?

Long story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife.

 I don’t know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. AITA?

AITA for telling my British neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?,I saw s similar post which inspire me this. I’m Albanian and I live in Guangzhou China. I live in an apartment building that’s filled wit mostly Chinese people and one British couple. They’ve been here 3 years longer than I have and can’t say anything other than NIHAO and XIEXIE. They constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which I told them to stop and start learning chinese. I taught myself to be half fluent in Chinese before I got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months I’ve been here. They managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic English but they left. I told them that they’ve been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. Yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. I told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying I’m an asshole and I’m making their lives difficult.

AITA for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?,"I'm 26M, my sister is 28F. We're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. I'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.

To make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

It took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

I'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school. I couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own child down. I don't know what's going to happen.

Was I the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, I wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. Never mind I don't even have a car. I'll admit I could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

Child services is what its name implies, here where I live it's called FACS. They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

I didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. I don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

And I can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It's been 8 days and no word on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return, I might as well not return.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my fiancee there's no take-backs?,"Here's the thing: I 27M proposed to my 26F fiancee(yay!). The proposal time was a surprise but the actual proposal was not, she knew it was coming for a while but this is where it starts to get a little weird. I got her advice and opinions on the *PERFECT* ring for her. We both make decent money but I wanted it to be special so I saved up about $9000 of my spending money over the years(we live together) so I can afford to have the perfect ring for her. She was pointing out this ring and that ring and these rings how perfect they were, what her ring size was, what kind of cut she wanted, what setting, what band, etc...


Anyways I landed on the perfect ring for her, she approved of it, and we were all set just waiting for it to be fitted properly. The ring came in about 3 weeks before the proposal and I made it special and she said yes, excitedly. I'm talking dinner, wine, roses, backrubs, movie in bed, THE WHOLE SHEBANG. There was not a detail I missed, I can assure you I went full perfect boyfriend(fiance now) lmao


Cue to now, which is now 5 weeks after the proposal, and suddenly the whole style of cut and setting that she wanted for her ring is awful. Apparently she made a HUGE mistake with what she wanted and now suddenly she doesn't like it. I asked her ""Maybe just wait a few weeks and see if your mind changes? You never know, maybe this is just proposal jitters or something"" and no she's adamantly against it. I told her in no uncertain terms that this ring cost me a lot of money and we did research for months(almost a full year) together and I thought her mind was made up. I can't return the ring so now I'm kind of fucked and she's crying and telling me to leave her alone all night tonight. I personally think she's being childish but I called my mom and she tells me that I should have gotten her something she wanted. I told her that I DID get her something she wanted but now she doesn't want it, now my mom is telling me to just sell it for a loss and get one she does want. I said fuck all that, not trying to be mean but I'm not going to return a ring that cost me almost 5 figures just because she changed her mind TWO MONTHS after I bought it and had proposed. I think she's talking to her friends now but idk what to think anymore. Am I being an asshole by not returning it? I could *technically* afford it but this will put a huge dent in my savings and our overall account in general not to mention how stressful all this has been for me.

AITA for banning my parents from my wedding if they don’t attend a tea ceremony?,"I’m (29f) going to get married this September (if a certain unnamed virus let us). For important context, I am white but my fiancée (31m) is Chinese-American. I’m going to admit that I’m one of those girls who has been planning her dream wedding since I was a girl. 
My husband doesn’t care as much and told me that I could plan the entire thing to my heart’s content with one caveat - there’s an important Chinese tea ceremony wherein the bride and groom make tea for both sets of parents and then the parents give them gifts. It’s incredibly important to him and the only thing he wants on our wedding day (Okay, he also consulted on the food and he wants to marry me lol).

He’s been planning that which will happen shortly before the wedding and will be a smaller ceremony with only family and very close friends. Today, while zooming with my parents, my parents said they found the whole ritual absurd and stupid and that she was going to skip it. Well, considering they’re an integral part of it, that doesn’t work for me. They couldn’t even explain why they thought the ritual was stupid, just that it was. I basically told them that if they skipped the tea ceremony, they should skip the wedding as well.

That led to a lot of crying and arguments and now my parents aren’t talking to me and my sisters have sent me texts about how irrational I’m being, how I’m being cruel, and how I’m being a bridezilla. But...this is important to my future husband so it’s important to me. It’s the only thing he really insisted upon for this wedding. But they are my parents and I want them to beat my wedding.

AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I don't have a breast?,"I am honestly heartbroken right now.

I (24F) am a breast cancer survivor. I have had my left breast removed and there's just a scar there now. 

When I go out I wear a silicon padding on my left breast otherwise it looks very odd and makes me self conscious.

I decided to move in with him about a month ago and we tried to have sex. 

I said tried because the moment he laid eyes on my breast his face went white and he refused to touch me further. He said I had cheated him and that I should have told him earlier about my breast.

I told him that I didn't think it was important since he said he loves all of me and that he thought I was beautiful. I am honestly so conflicted right now and I feel like a horrible person.

AITA for not defending my cousin after he stole my baby name?,"I’m currently 31 weeks pregnant with my first child- a little girl!  I’ve known for years what I want to name my child.  The first name has sentimental meaning for me, and my husband and I chose the second name together.  We’ve planned the name for years- when we were dating and talking about the future, one of the things we always said was that our firstborn would have this name.  It’s gender neutral, so it didn’t matter if it was a girl or a boy.  

As soon as we found out I was pregnant, we started referring to the baby by name.  Because we’ve had this name in mind for so many years, our whole family knows the name and the meaning behind it.  We’ve already started decorating the nursery with little items that have the name or initials on them. There’s basically been no question that this would be our child’s name.

My cousin’s wife gave birth two weeks ago.  They had refused to tell anyone what name(s) they were thinking about during the pregnancy, which is fine.  But the name that they ended up choosing is pretty much exactly the same as the name my husband and I chose for our baby.  It’s exactly the same first name and then an almost identical second name.  It would be like if our baby’s name was Mary Elizabeth, then the name they chose is Mary Eliza. The actual name isn’t as traditional/common as that, so it really does stand out as being the same name.

I was pretty upset when I found out, because they definitely knew the name we’d chosen and it feels weird and kind of spiteful to use it.  I know we don’t own the name or anything, so we can’t stop them from using it, but it still felt pretty icky.  My husband and I basically decided to just be sort of privately weirded out but to try our best to ignore it.  I sent my cousin a text to tell him and his wife congrats on the baby, and then didn’t reach out any further than that. I didn’t say anything to him about the name.

Well, it turns out that even though my husband and I are trying to take the high road here, the rest of the family is pretty mad.  Apparently, a bunch of them (including my cousin’s mom) have reached out and told my cousin and his wife that what they did is really shitty and that they need to think about changing their baby’s name. They’ve also reached out to me to say that they think it’s awful and that they know how much meaning the name has for me.  I absolutely didn’t ask them to do this, but I can’t pretend I’m not happy that people are “taking our side.”

My cousin called me yesterday and said that I need to call all of our family and tell them to stop pressuring him about the name and that I’m fine with it, because they’re ruining his and his wife’s time with their newborn.  I have no intention of doing so because A) I didn’t ask them to talk to him about it in the first place and B) I’m not fine with it; I think it’s weird that he and his wife did this and I have no interest in defending him.

"AITA for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?","Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

This morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!

AITA for not splitting my inheritance with my estranged sister?,"So, this is obviously a long story spanning our entire lives but I will try to condense it as best I can. Players are: Me (30f), my sis (34f), husband (39m), Neice (5f), and dad (80m)

My older sister has had trouble with drugs, alcohol, and the law our entire life. She has been bakeracted no less than 20 times since her 18th birthday and has actually technically died twice due to her decisions(she's back by the grace of the medical professionals treating her). My dad has constantly bailed her out on anything whether it be jail or missing rent payments because she spent the money on drugs.

My dad had cancer for the last decade. Despite my sister and him already living in the same apartment complex and my dad paying the entirety of her rent, my husband and I were essentially forced to move across our city 3 months before our wedding because Dad was starting chemo and needed extra help. My next 3 years were devoted to caring for dad. I lost 2 jobs due to the time I needed to take off to care for him and my sister continued to mooch and do absolutely nothing for him. I was the one expected to make medical decisions for him alone because he didn't trust my sister not to try to off him for his money.

Dad is now finally at peace and against my better judgment, I asked my sister to come by so she could say her goodbyes. Before they even came to take him from his apartment to the funeral home, she was demanding that I open and read the will. She insisted that Dad had been paying for her to try to finally earn her Bachelors and she needed 2k. This amount changed to 3k within 24 hours. She started pointing at Dads belongings and said that she was ""claiming items she wanted"". 

After I finally read the will (I'm the executor of the estate), we learned that Dad left everything to me except for creating a trust fund for my niece that my sister cant touch until her 21st. My sister lost her mind and started demanding that I split what I got from him. Dad also left specific instructions to me and my husband to use what he had left us to buy a house, pay off our debts, and finally start a family and we really want to honor his last wishes, but we wouldn't be able to if I split it with my sister.

I went to the doctor yesterday because I’ve been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like “We gotta get this implant out of you” (I had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and I decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because I don’t want to conceive.


I call my husband and tell him and he’s like “Oh ok did you get on the pill?” And I said no, I didn’t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it’s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I’m like trying to get pregnant without his consent. Should I have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)

"AITA for inviting my brother to my wedding, but not his wife?","I’m engaged. My fiancée is fat. She was when I met her. I’ve always found her irresistibly sexy. Not looking for commentary or unsolicited advice on this point. 

My fiancée and I sent out save the dates for the wedding. My brother got one, his wife very intentionally did not. 

He got married last year. His wife had all my siblings’ significant others as bridesmaids, whether they were married or dating. Even my (other) brother’s girlfriend who he’d only been with for a few months. I’d been with my girlfriend for nearly five years at that point and everyone knew it was a question of when, not if, we’d get married. 

She didn’t ask my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid because she didn’t want to be constrained to picking a bridesmaids dress available in plus sizes and did not want to have my girlfriend in her wedding photos. 

I’m not speculating. That’s not something I ever could’ve guessed. That’s what she said, in her own words, when we arrived at the wedding to find everyone else’s SOs were bridesmaids but her, and asked what was going on. 

I thought maybe it was a Bridezilla moment and she’d realize how hurtful it was later, but it’s been over a year, and while my brother has apologized again and again for ever having allowed that to happen (why he’s invited), his wife never did at all. Even when it’s been brought up in front of her. 

We’ve only seen them a couple times since the wedding, and my fiancée has tried to forgive and forget, but it’s still uneasy between us because of the singular lens we now know she views my fiancée through. 

My fiancée doesn’t mind grinning and bearing for the occasional family event we have to attend, but I didn’t feel like it would be right to make her spend her wedding day with someone who would ever treat her as less than human. 

We’re having a very intimate wedding, (20 people and 12 are family.) Having that woman there would taint the whole dynamic. That being said, the rest of my family is understandably upset. 

My family, my brother especially, feel like we’re trying to make them choose sides. (In my other brother’s words “Even if that wasn’t your intention, it’s the result, and that’s a real asshole move none of us deserve. *We* didn’t do anything to [your fiancée].” 

I definitely don’t want to make anyone choose sides, and he’s not wrong that they didn’t cause the problem and don’t deserve the fallout. But my wife also deserves a wedding day with only people who love and cherish her.

AITA for lying to my dying husband & destroying his parents life?,"Posting from a throwaway account. 
Me (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!
When we moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy. 

My husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near each other so the kids and I would have a support network.

I lied to my husband. I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn’t add to it. I chose the easy way out.

2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man’s last wish. I have told them we will visit every year & they are welcome to visit us in Canada whenever they wish. They don’t care – they said I have broken their family.

AITA for not having another baby for my husband's brother?,"My husband and I have 5 children. Our first died right after birth (freak mutation). We then had four more children. My husband's brother and his wife have been trying for long while, and when they approached me to be a surrogate, I agreed to give it a try. 

The first try miscarried, and I agreed to try a second time. Unfortunately, that next try ended in a stillbirth. They are already badgering me for a third try. I'm not doing this again.

I've now carried and birthed 6 babies. I've been pregnant too many times. I am mentally and physically DONE. My tubes have already been removed after child #4+5, and when I can, I'll be getting a hysterectomy. My doctor says I could have more pregnancies, but that I'm now high risk for bladder issues and uterine lapse in the future. I'm ready to pack it in now. I'm done being a brood mare.

My husband is now worried about my health and supports me, but he's never been good at standing up to his family. My sister in law is calling me crying daily, and I don't know how long I can be nice, especially with now implied legal threats. 

I feel bad for them that all I could do was hand them a gravestone, but that was my last pregnancy. I can't risk my health again. I have my own kids to think about. AITA for not trying again for them?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not going to wedding after agreeing to be best man?,"Last year my best childhood friend (28M) asked me (28M) to be best man at his wedding, and I happily agreed. I think the process brought us closer together as we talked weekly for the next few months planning logistics and the bachelor party.

I worked hard on the bachelor party, which was a far away vacation. I spent months planning, and lots of money. I found time in everyone's schedule and booked an amazing vacation, it was a blast! I was his only childhood friend at the bachelor party, and everyone else was from his college frat. It was therefore like a typical college party setting, I did my best to learn all the drinking games they already knew how to play, and I thought we had a great time. 

I guess I was out of my element, however, because my friend later told me that he felt like he bonded with his other friends better that weekend, and how he wants one of them to be the bestman instead.

So I calmly told him that's fine, and that I won't be coming to the wedding because I feel like my efforts as a pre-bestman were underappreciated, and I feel uncomfortable traveling to spend a days with people who make me feel that way. 

He got upset, and his fiance told me I should ""grow up"" and be a good friend; I told them that we're all grownups, and we have no obligation to each other just because we're childhood friends. Friend and his fiance called me an asshole, so AITA?

TL;DR: I agreed to be friend's bestman, then he changed his mind over a year later after I fulfilled pre-wedding bestman duties, and I decided not to go to the wedding.",Not the A-hole
AITA for buying my daughter toys and refusing for my niece? My sister is acting entitled about it all saying horrible things,"My husband Dean (29) and I (26F) have a wonderful little girl Lisa and she’s 4. I’m a musician by trade so my work has pretty much stopped and my husband has been working a lot the past few months. I’m basically at home all the time with Lisa and she is missing her dad a lot as she’s his double and 100% a daddy’s girl.

Anyway, I met up with my sister Rose (32) recently and we ended up visiting a toy store. I saw this male doll which looked a lot like Dean and I decided to buy it for Lisa so that she’d always have an reminder of her daddy. Rose was miffed by this and demanded I buy my niece Flora (also 4) a doll. For years Rose has been trying to basically force me to treat her daughter the same or better than my own. Here are some examples of her behaviour.  There’s only five months between the girls and I’ve had to deal with Rose being weird about that fact for years and during my pregnancy. Lisa is my second daughter as I had a stillborn daughter in late 2014 at 20 and it broke me. Rose witnessed this and when she announced her pregnancy, she was horrible and said that she was expecting the first Grandchild saying my daughter didn’t count as she died whilst our parents and family said it was the second grandchild. Then, when I got pregnant again Rose was weird about it saying I shouldn’t have gotten pregnant so quickly and accused me of stealing her thunder of the “new grandchild.” There’s been some other occasions where she just expects our kids to share everything or make everything about Flora for being the first grandchild and I’ve just had to put up with it.

Anyway, Rose kept on insisting and I just snapped and said “no. I am sick of you pushing your kid onto me and basically making my one take a backseat. I’m buying MY kid a doll literally to make her happy cos she’s missing her daddy. Buy your own kid a fucking toy.” I ended up buying the toy and walking off. She went tattling to our parents adding dramatic flair to the story calling me a massive bitch for refusing to buy my niece a toy. My dad is in my side saying I’ve had to put up with her glorifying her kid for years whilst ignoring mine whilst my mom thinks I should give into her. My husband says he’s sick of Rose and She even brought up my dead daughter again saying “she’d be ashamed of her mommy.” That reduced me to tears and I told her she’s dead to me but my mum insists I apologise TO ROSE.

I just want to take this opportunity to educate people a bit more about colourblindness, and how you can help if your day to day lives!
I saw one comment that asked how i could drive if i can't distinguish between red and green (due to traffic lights). It made me laugh whether it was troll or genuine but please check out :

And those who are asking, i have heard of enchroma glasses! Maybe one day i will experience all the colours (after some saving). 


________________________________________________

I'm a 19F currently attending university.

One of my main professor's insists on using the whiteboard in class, for explaining everything and anything. Whether it's words or diagrams or explanations, so it's pretty important to be able to read.

Here's the problem: i'm colourblind and i cannot distinguish the difference between red and green ... like at all. It just looks the same to me.

This is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.

So i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.

The professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.

(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).

Anyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! 

I got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.

I feel pretty bad. I don't want this guys career to suffer just because of some pens haha. The stress is getting to me. AITA reddit?",Not the A-hole
AITA for threatening to sue my sister because her kids broke my iPad?,"This happened a couple of days before Christmas. 

My sister, her 3 kids (4,6,8), and I were all staying at my parents house for the holidays. 
I have a 1TB iPad Pro (the largest screen model) that I use for my job. I do digital commissions, design band posters, design flyers to make money on the side as I’m in college. I saved up for a year to buy this iPad, it was an investment in my hobby. 

I left the iPad plugged up in my fathers study where I was working on some projects the night before. I got up in the morning to find the thing *shattered* in the living room. My sister nonchalantly apologized and said “oh sorry the kids broke your screen. Dad says he has a new one he’ll give you to replace it.”  She didn’t even bother to wake me up when she saw that they were broke it. I asked her why she wasn’t watching her fucking kids, and how they got my iPad from my fathers study. She said that she *gave it to them* so they could watch YouTube. 
I obviously started yelling at her, and asked her how she could be to obtuse as to let her kids play with my stuff without asking. She called me selfish. “They’re my niece and nephews and I should want to share with them.” Wtf.

My dad tried to give me a iPad Air, and tell me that it was the same thing. I told him it was unacceptable and I wanted my iPad replaced *immediately*. He said he didn’t have the money, so I went to my sister and demanded the money. She tried to ask if she could make payments as the cost would wipe out her savings, and I said no way. I wanted the full cost of the iPad, the pencil , AND the $250 that I’m going to miss out on because I couldn’t finish the project I was working on It would be around $2200 dollars. 

She tried to call me heartless, and told me to think of my niece and nephew. I told her to go fuck herself, if she was a better mother she’d have more than 2k saved up when she has three kids. My parents think I’m over reacting, but I don’t. She is trying to avoid me and not speak to me, and I told her that I would be suing her then for the full cost of my iPad and lost wages.
She’s acting like a total bitch, and crying on social media about how her heartless brother is trying to sue her and break her and her children over an “honest mistake”. I’ve gotten calls from several family members calling me a bad brother, and asking me to reconsider. I can’t believe this is happening.

AITA for refusing to take my stepsister along on a family trip that my fiancé is paying for?,"I've changed some details because I’m pretty sure my stepsister uses reddit.

When I was 11 my mom married my stepdad who also had a 13-year-old daughter. For the purpose of this post we’ll call her Emma. Me and Emma have never gotten along, when I was 22 I finally went no contact with her.

The straw that finally broke the camel’s back was when she gleefully announced she was pregnant with my then fiancé…. On Christmas day. That was honestly one of the worst times in my life and it took me a really long time to recover from the betrayal. Emma ended up marrying my ex and they have a little boy together.

I’m currently 28 and engaged to a wonderful man, who is a lot better than my ex ever was. Emma and my ex ended up divorcing after 3 years and she now lives with my mom and stepdad.

My fiancé has family in Italy who he’d like me (and my parents) to meet before the wedding. The original plan was to go this summer but obviously with COVID our plans got put on hold. I was discussing the plans to reschedule for next year with my mom recently and she asked me if I was going to invite Emma and her son along. I told her I wasn’t and she asked me to reconsider because she didn’t think my stepdad would come otherwise (that’s fine with me, its really my mom and dad that my fiancé wants to introduce to his family). She argued Emma has matured since becoming a mom and getting divorced and that she wants to attempt to have a relationship with me.

When I told her I wasn’t interested she said I was putting her in an awkward position and that I was taking my half-sister and stepbrother on my dad's side so she felt like I was favouring him (my stepbrother is literally the person who introduced me to my fiancé and my half-sister and I are close). She also said it’s unfair because Emma could never afford a trip like this on her own and my nephew would be the one to miss out on bonding time with his cousins.

She asked me to reconsider before she left and has only replied to my texts to ask if I’d changed my mind. I’m starting to feel guilty because I know mine and Emma’s dislike for one another has put a massive strain on my mom’s marriage and it’s not fair to her. My mom’s sisters have also called me to ask me to change my mind. I’m starting to worry my mom might not come either with how cold she’s being.

My “full” sister has also reached out and told me Emma had been going to therapy and has realised that what she did was horrible and that I should consider forgiving her because she was going through a lot of her own issues (depression/low self-esteem) at the time and that my ex also made her suffer a lot too.

Realistically, if she came on the trip, I could just avoid her the entire time, but I also don’t know if she has changed or if she’ll start up her old tricks again. My fiancé is also the one paying for the trip and I selfishly don’t want him to pay for her.

AITA?

Edit: I tried to read all of the comments but I have around 900+ unread messages so I thought I'd just answer some of the questions being asked repeatedly here:

1. Did Emma ever apologise? 

No.

2. Why are you taking your entire family to Italy? 

My fiancé wants to give our families the chance to get to know one another and he hopes they'll be as close as his parent's families are. Also, he thinks I'll be more comfortable with my family there as well instead of being ""thrown in the deep end"" with all of his family in a foreign country.

Also, our parents have already met this is to meet his extended family (grandparents/aunts/uncles/cousins).

3. Does your fiancé know/what is his opinion?

He knows. I moved in with my dad shortly after everything went down and my fiancé was already close friends with my stepbrother so he used to hang out at my dad's place a lot so he saw the whole aftermath. 

He thinks the request is ridiculous but he has said he won't make the decision for me. My mom hasn't actually asked him despite threatening to but he has made it clear he'll make sure she knows he doesn't want my stepsister there. 

4. Why won't/can't your mom just come on her own?

This is just an assumption but I think she doesn't want to face my dad alone, they haven't had the best relationship after everything that went down.

5. Can't your stepdad/mom pay for her and you just don't invite her to the family events?

In theory, yes but we'll be staying with my fiancé's family so this may raise uncomfortable questions. If they want to get her a hotel and just not interact with my fiancé's family the whole time that's fine with me.

Also, thank you for the awards!",Not the A-hole
AITA For Telling My GF She Doesn't Understand Real Life?,"I'm M23 my gf is F21 and we've been together for about 2 years now.

Because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (She's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. My car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole.

"AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before","I feel like I need to say this for this post not to be removed, this is not about the date, about relationships or something I want a judgement on me walking out of there.

Cast: Me (25M), Joe(26M), Jane(24F)

To give you a little background to this situation, I met Jane through Joe's girlfriend at her birthday party last year. At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.

Unfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.

So first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.

Well that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.

We agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.

I have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it.

AITA for charging rent from my dad but not from my mom?,"My father and his family lost their home and had no place to live. He has a teenage son, my half brother, who is 15 and a known smoker. Because they had nowhere else to go, I offered them to stay at our other house we usually rent out to other people. The house is situated within our property, just next to our home. 

Prior to my dad moving in, my mother and my sister moved in with us 6 months ago after my stepdad passed away. 

We have many spare bedrooms in our home so them moving in wasn't a problem. . 

This is where the conflict arises :

I don't charge rent from my mom. I don't let her cook. I cook for 5 people in our home (my husband, my mom, my toddler and my sister). It's just my way of looking out for my mom because that's what she did for me when I was young and struggling. She raised me as a single mother for years.. 

My dad has a problem with this because I am charging him and his wife the same rent I charge other tenants (it's a well furnished house). He thinks I'm playing favourites between parents because I don't charge my mom any money. He thinks he should pay less rent as compared to other tenants because I'm his daughter.

 Apparently, he doesn't like to be reminded of the fact that he charged me rent the one time when I was very sick and had to move in with him and his wife when I was in college. I had a part time job, and struggled to pay my bills with my illness. I wasn't shown any consideration. 

He also has a problem because my husband doesn't help him out with his groceries. He is older now, 71 and thinks we should be the one getting him his groceries. We don't think so, his wife is 50 and he has a young son. They can be the ones doing the grocery shopping if he's to fragile to move around.

AITA for getting a teeny tiny tattoo my husband didn’t know about?,"Second edit at the bottom!! 

Sooo to preface this, I love tattoos. I have several of them. BUT they are all in a position that I can still conceal them if it comes to needing to look “professional”. My husband however, hates tattoos. They aren’t his thing, he doesn’t have any and that’s fine. Your body, your choice. 

I’ve always wanted just one stupid no meaning tattoo. Don’t ask why, I’m not sure, the thrill of it I guess? All of my other tattoos have some sort of deep meaning and I love them all. 

I want to get a teeny tiny avocado on the side of my big toe... an avoca-toe if you will. 

I had discussed this with a couple close friends, some find it hilarious, because... it is. But others are disgusted and disappointed and brought up that my husband wouldn’t like that at all and would probably be pretty upset. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I got a tattoo my husband will probably dislike?

AITA for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?,"My brother (26/M) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. 

Long story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a DNA test confirming he’s the dad, now he pays child support. They share custody. 

I had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. I told him for the first time that it’s his fault. He chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. He got mad and said it’s not fair because women can abort but men can’t, I told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. He called me an asshole, but I was just being honest.

AITA for telling my husband to grow a pair,"My husband and I have been together for 16 years, married for 11. He has always had a pretty low pain tolerance though he won’t admit it (once he accidentally kneeled on one of our toddler’s hot wheels cars and it put him out of commission for the entire day although nothing was broken or even bruised). I’ve become alarmed many times at his over reactive response to things like stubbing his toe or hitting his funny bone on something, he will literally moan and whine and shout out in pain over the most minor stuff. 

I always thought of it as a quirk of his, not too major to actually have a conversation about, until yesterday. I have what my doctors believe is Crohn’s disease, and I’ve been in the thick of a nasty flare-up for the last few days. For those of you unfamiliar, it’s an inflammatory bowel disease and causes diarrhea, vomiting, etc. I was trying to take a nap for some relief and had just gotten to sleep, when I hear an actual scream from downstairs. I jump out of bed and find my husband clutching his hand. I asked what happened and he told me he pinched his finger in the baby gate. I looked at it and it wasn’t even red, no broken skin. 

I told him he woke me up with his scream and probably also woke up our son, and he said he couldn’t help it, it just hurt so bad. I said ‘you know what else hurts? Shitting my brains out all morning and not being able to take a nap because you’re being so loud over a minor mishap’. He got really offended and said that I wouldn’t like it if I pinched my finger either and I said no I sure wouldn’t but I also wouldn’t scream my head off, I didn’t even do that when I was giving birth to a 9-lb baby unmedicated. He said well your body was made to do that, I’m not made to get my finger stuck in a baby gate. This is when I rolled my eyes, told him to grow a pair, and went back upstairs to try and rest.

Yes, I said it out of anger, but my husband is acting like I emasculated him horribly and insulted him to his very core and is barely speaking to me. I’m not in any hurry to apologize especially since he didn’t for waking me up when I’m dealing (pretty silently) with objectively more pain than he was.

ETA: I can pretty definitively say that he doesn’t have an underlying medical condition. He has to get medical checkups for work regularly. I honestly agree with most of the comments stating he just wants attention; the overreactions ramp up when I’m having a flare or when we’re at a big family gathering or something.",Not the A-hole
AITA for embarrassing a girl trying to steal from me,"I made this account because I'm tired of the passive aggressive bull this girl keeps throwing at me, so I want to see if I'm the ass or her. 

Firstly,  I'm a guy,  26, who tries to have the healthiest life style I can.  I also make a good amount of money and can buy the natural lotions and skin care/bath care products I can get. These aren't cheap and when I do get them I make sure I use them smartly and make them last. 

My roommate and I get along great, she doesn't touch my things in the bathroom and I don't touch hers. She has her own shelf,  I have mine.  She does have a friend who comes over sometimes who is a self proclaimed beauty guru who does reviews on line to her 500 followers. But doesn't have a job and 'borrows' products from her friends. 

A few months ago she came over, and I had just gone to my room to get dressed,  products left on the tub bench, and I hear her in the bathroom practically squealing ""girl you got the good stuff! Let me use it, my followers will love it!""

I hear my roommate say no that it's not hers and the friend just says quietly that she'll use it when I go to work. After I get out of my room to head to work I immediately get my products put them in my room and listen to her start to do her show in our living room,  stating what products she's about to get to which I say loudly. 

""No you're not, I bought them, if you want them then get a job and buy them."" I then locked them in my room and since then she's told me how she lost followers, got mocked for trying to steal and was sobbing in her live stream.

AITA for purposefully making my meal-prep super spicy to stop my BF from eating it?,"Okay so my boyfriend atm stays home and I work three 12s a week. That said, I like to meal prep so I don’t have to cook every day for my lunches. 

Well, my boyfriend, WHO STAYS HOME ALL DAY, thinks it’s a good idea to eat my lunches while i’m at work. I’ve asked him to stop but he says, “But your food is so good. Plus why don’t you make more so I can have some?” I’ve told him multiple times that I’m stressed and that I can’t make more meals because it’s a lot of work. 

So he continued to eat my food. I remember that he HATES spicy food while I really enjoy it. So what do I do? Add spice. A lot of it. 

Last time he ate something of mine, he called me yelling at me. He said I was being an asshole and that I know he hates spicy food. I told him, “Tough. Stop eating my food then.”

Now he’s mad at me....

Tl;dr- After asking my boyfriend NOT to eat my meal prepped food, I purposely made my latest meal preps SUPER spicy and now my boyfriend says I’m an asshole. AITA?

UPDATE: Holy smokes, I didn’t expect for this to blow up... as for some questions, doubling my recipes would take more time. I use a lot of veggies and rice when I cook and I homemake my sauces and which takes a lot of time. 

For those of you who say I need to dump him, it’s a big consideration, but it’s hard. He may not be the most considerate person and I’ve brushed it aside since I’ve been very lonely for a while. When we first started, he used to cook a lot for me and that was great. But after we moved in together, he changed and expected me to cook/shop/clean more often. Worst of all, dating for me is extremely difficult. I work in transportation, and while I have a schedule now, I used to have to work nights so dating was hard. A lot of dates were upset with  me and my job because of lack of availability. This guy seemed independent enough that me being gone for two to three days wasn’t a problem. For reference he’s early thirties and I’m late twenties. 

Honestly, I’m overwhelmed with what to do. We have a lease together and while I can fully support myself, he can’t since he’s laid off and I’d feel terrible to kick him to the curb. So for now, I’m logging out... thanks everyone.

UPDATE TWO: Okaaaaay so after a long conversation with my now ex-boyfriend... we decided to end it. I told him that eating my food wasn’t okay and that because he’s home all day since he was laid off, he still needs to carry his weight with the housework, shopping, and cooking like he used to when we first met. What happened? He had a Brett Kavanaugh style break down. Just started crying and saying it wasn’t fair because he’s stressed and shouldn’t have to worry about, and I quote, “Stupid things like cooking and cleaning.”  So I told him my perspective that I’m tired, I’m dealing with people all day, and I just want my lunch untouched or replaced when I meal prep. I mentioned that it was never a problem in the past and don’t understand why it’s an issue now. He just started yelling at me saying I was starting a stupid argument and that it’s not an issue. He doesn’t have the money to get takeout like he used or buy food. He said that because he was laid off, he needs me to buy all of the groceries, pay his half of the rent and utilities, and cook for him. 

We then got into other issues of our relationship and things that have been building for a while. These are things I’d rather not get into, but nonetheless, I told him I’m tired and honestly would be happier without him. He stopped crying, got all red faced, and started screaming at me. I told him to get his stuff, go to his parent’s house, and not come back.  When he tried to fight it, I told him that I won’t hesitate to call the cops since the neighbors probably heard him screaming at me. This Monday, he and I are going to the leasing office to get him off the lease. I’m in the process of boxing up his stuff for him to move out. I’d rather do it myself and have him take his boxed stuff than have him here and do it. The less time I have to see him, the less chance I’ll change my mind. 

Honestly, I cried a lot last night. But after a while, I realized it was nice to be alone in my own bed. I could actually spread out and enjoy it. Thank you to everyone who have been supportive. I’ve been unhappy in this relationship for a while and just didn’t know if breaking up was the best course of action. Thanks for saying that I deserve more and letting me see past rose tinted glasses.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to change out of my bikini to save my niece's feelings?,"My husband assures me that i'm not TA, and I agreed at the time but now I feel a bit guilty because I don't want to upset anyone, a child least of all.


Since i've been home more for quarantine I Marie-Kondo'd my closet, which means getting rid of all of my old bathing suits (they all lost elasticity or were worn out) except for one - this is relevant later.


This past weekend we had a small family gathering at our house because its hot and we have a pool (and quarantine limitations had been lifted in our area a while ago so we finally decided to get together for the first time in 3 months). My husbands parents, his brother and wife (SIL), and their 2 kids, niece 9f and nephew 6m came over. 


So we're all in the backyard BBQing and getting ready to swim. I change into my swimwear and come outside and start applying sunscreen. SIL rushes over to me and pulls me aside and asks that I cover up or change into something less revealing like a 1-piece as niece has been sensitive lately and dealing with some body image issues regarding feeling fat (she's not). I tell her that regrettably this is the only swimsuit I have anymore due to cleaning out my closet and I plan on swimming as it was sweltering hot, but after my sunscreen dries i'd be happy to throw something on over my swimsuit until i'm actually in the water. 


She then asked me if I could just go inside then at least until the sunscreen soaks in and come out covered up. I was like uh no? I'm not going to hide in my home for 30+ mins while we have company over that we haven't seen in 3 months. SIL says it will hurt niece to see me in a 2-piece because of my ""unrealistic body image"". I tell her there's nothing unrealistic about me because i'm a real person so I don't even know what that means, and i'm sure niece will be fine for only 30 mins. I also said that while I sympathize with body image issues as i've dealt with them in the past myself, it's probably not helping to just shelter her from seeing people's bodies and maybe work on body positivity instead. She says I don't understand because I don't have kids. So I sit in the shade to apply sunscreen and let it soak in and she takes niece inside for over half an hour before coming back out. 


I don't know if i'm in the wrong here, maybe I could have just gone inside for a while to spare my niece's feelings but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't have to hide my body - and at my own house for that matter. And it was just a 2-piece, it wasn't like really booby or revealing - the top was high-cut kinda like a sports bra and the bottoms were normal bikini cut, they weren't like a thong bottom or anything. I didn't notice that niece was upset but SIL definitely was, maybe niece was just hiding her feelings? I don't want to add to her body image issues and feel kinda bad now reflecting on it in case I made her feel bad. AITA?


Edit: wow I was not expecting this kind of response. Thanks for your judgment everyone, i'm replying where I can. There's a lot of people dragging SIL in the comments, but I will note that she's generally a good person even though she may have come off badly in my post, I personally don't think it's her fault and suspect social media or peer pressure is the cause of niece feeling bad about her body, but that's just my personal speculation.",Not the A-hole
AITA for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

For reference, I am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

On Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

BF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

He told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

We've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

AITA for interrupting my roomates having sex in the kitchen while our mutual dinner is being made?,"Throwaway account btw. Two nights ago I walked into the kitchen to ask my roomates what they wanted to do for dinner. We started making some pasta, so I went to my bedroom (located directly next to the kitchen) to play some games while waiting for the pasta to cook. I hear the timer set on alexa go off, and my roomate moan ""Alexa stop."" I interrupt them by walking out there and announcing myself by asking ""Is dinner ready?"" So they have to quickly stop and pretend nothing was happening. I decide to stick around because dinner is practically done now. Female roomate goes to the bathroom, and I bring it up to male roomate while we're in the kitchen. I let him know I think it's inconsiderate for a couple reasons, and I really don't want to see that. While eating dinner, I send a similar message over snapchat to female roomate, who has been angry at me for two days now. Male roomate already had a more extensive conversation with me about it, and we agree about not having sex in a ""public"" place in the house. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my kids every weekend?,"My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. 

Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. 

I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",Asshole

AITA For not considering my parents adopted children as my siblings and not being willing to take them in if something happens to my parents,"I know the title probably makes me sound horrible, but there is a lot more to the story.

So my parents had me very late in their lives after a crapton of tries and being told they could not have kids. Well here I am, but my dad was 51 and my mom 45 when I was born.

Despite their age they were amazing parents, loving, caring, strict but fair and they were in a very good financial position in large part due to their age, so they put me through very good schools and paid my tuition to Uni and so on, in other words I had a great youth and was set up for success.

Well I am 26 now, I am doing well for myself, however the problem started 3 years ago. They missed having me in the house, it felt empty they said so they were considering adoption from another country where laws are more lacking as in our country their age would likely prevent them from even being considered, I told them that this was a horrible idea due to thrir age.

Last year they succeeded in adopting a little girl and her brother aged 3 and 5 and I have only met them a few times so far all times they were extremely shy and frankly, I am not close to them at all as I live halfway across the country so obviously I do not consider them my siblings but more so as my parents kids.

Issue is my dad is now 77 and my mom is 71, they are still very fit for their age and have a live in nanny to help out, but lets be honest, they are in the agegroup where it is likely the end is near.

So I visited them a week ago and asked them what their plans were for the kids if they die before they are adults and they were pretty much lost for words, looked confused and answered ""Obviously you will take them in, you are their brother."" I pretty much had the same rwaction as they had to my question and told them there was no way, I hardly know them, I am not close to them, I do not consider them my siblings and I certainly wont take care of two kids.

Went over about as well as you can expect, loads of yelling and screaming which led to me leaving, I have not spoken to them since apart from my mom sending me messages to reconsider. Obviously I do feel bad though, there is no one else who can take care of them, no other family, no close friends, just me, so they'll end up in the foster system.

AITA for calling my aunt a fcking idiot and searching her room?,"My aunt and cousin are staying with my family for a little while. I have asthma, and I take pills for it every night.

Yesterday morning my cousin came up to me and asked if I could stop taking my pills because it triggers her. Anyone else in the world, I would’ve said no. But my cousin is a recovering drug addict, so I said I can take it in another room but I still have to take it. She got mad but left me alone.

Night came when I was supposed to take my meds, I leave my meds on my desk so I know where it is. I went to my desk to grab it and it was gone. I asked everyone in my house if they had taken it, and they said no.

I had this feeling in my gut, like I already knew what happened. I went into the room my aunt and cousin were staying in, and started searching. Looked in the bedside table. There they were, my meds. My aunt walked in right as I was going to take them, and started screaming at me about going into ‘her’ room. (Last i check this was still my parents house) 

She grabbed the meds out of my hand and said it’s really difficult for my cousin not to relapse when she knows I’m taking pills (dude. They’re pink and bubble gum flavored; they’re barely even pills) She said that I’m going to have to do with out my meds while they were there. Now lemme just say, my aunt is one of those crazy, anti vax, essential oil, type bitch. She doesn’t believe in asthma.

So, I snatched my meds out of her hand and called her a fucking idiot. Because I can’t breathe if I don’t take those meds.

She got angry and told my mom that I called her a fucking idiot and searched the room. My mom took away my phone.

AITA for suddenly disinviting my father 4 days before my wedding ? He even paid for my wedding and I haven't spoken to him since.,"Just to be clear, I got married in early February. 

I have always been very close to my father and stepmom growing up. I always felt like they offered me a stable home for me to grow up in. I never had that with my mother. During the last few years of my parents' marriage, my mother changed as a person. She was a happy and cheerful person when we were younger. She really changed after the divorce. She was miserable, and I felt that. I could tell that she hated the fact that I preferred to live with my dad, but never verbalized her feelings.

She has been single since the divorce, and refuses to date other people. I always wanted to have joint birthday parties with my mom, dad and stepmom, but my mom wouldn't have it. She avoided my father like the plague. I never understood her behavior and resented her for it.

Quite naturally, I preferred my dad's household over my mom's. Anyways, right before my wedding, I was staying at my dad's.

One night, I overheard my dad and stepmom reminiscing about how they met. Now they always told us that they met 6 months after the divorce at a library. Turns out, they lied.

They were talking about how my father couldn't take his eyes off her the moment she walked into his office and how he wanted her from that moment on, and how he didn't care that he had a pregnant wife at home.

Apparently their first kiss was a few days after I was born, and the first time they had sex was on my parents' 3rd anniversary. I was only a few months old back then. They were talking about how difficult it was for them to continue their relationship after they got caught when I was 5. This was extremely shocking to me because my parents got divorced when I was 10. They were also making fun of my mom's weight.

This meant that they carried on an affair throughout my parents' marriage. I remember my mom changing for the worse when I was in second grade.

My mom always knew and she never told me. I broke down crying that night and I felt really guilty because of the way I acted towards my mom growing up. I had no idea she went through so much. I was cheated on by my first boyfriend in college and it destroyed me. I felt horrible.

 That night, I didn't confront my dad but the next morning, I packed my shit up and transferred the amount he had spent on my wedding. I didn't want his money. I told him I heard every thing and asked him to stay away from my wedding.

I left their house and drove to my mom's. I hugged her really hard and we both cried.

I had my mom walk me down the aisle, and I made sure my dad's family didn't attend the wedding. I didn't explicitly disinvite my half brother, but he stayed away from my wedding and I'm actually glad be didn't come.

I don't think I want anything to do with any of them anymore.

I've heard from the grapevine that my dad is on anti depressants nowadays. My grandma blames me for his depression. 

Did I overreact? I still don't want anything to do with him. My dad's family think I was and I am being cruel to him.

AITA for not telling people I’m not the celebrity they think I am?,"I look very similar to an actor and I live in New York City. 

Every so often a tourist would stop me and say “oh my gosh you’re that guy!” And I used to interrupt them and say “no I’m really not.”

But then this guy started starring in a TV show so became way more recognizable. It started so I was being stopped 3-5 times a day by people. 

Once I was in a mad rush and on the phone so when someone said “Aaahhhh you’re that guy can I take a selfie” I just smiled for the selfie and said have a great day. 

It was faster than explaining and insisting I’m not the guy while they accuse me of being too big for the fans, it was kind of funny to think of a picture of me floating around as a celebrity, and it was kind of nice to see how happy they looked when they thought they’d met this guy even for ten seconds. 

So now when people stop me I just take picture or shake their hand and move on. I thought it was just funny and never really thought much beyond that. 

But I was on a date the other night and the girl said “hey has anyone ever told you you look like that guy from that show” and I told her this story and she was horrified. 

She said it was so mean to mislead people that way. That hadn’t occurred to me and I really don’t want to be a dick to people, I thought it was something they’d eventually look back on and laugh too. Didn’t occur to me it would be so upsetting.

AITA for kicking my roommate out for something that her friend did?,"I am a 37 year old man and my roommate is an early-30s woman. I rent a two-bedroom house and it had a spare room, so I decided to look for a roommate last year. I had a couple of people interested, but a friend asked me for a favor and I let her move in. She pays about 30% of the rent because that's all she can afford.

My roommate has one particularly good friend who she invites over regularly. I do not like that woman at all. She is loud, self-centered, and has no concept of boundaries, property, or privacy. She has ""accidentally"" eaten my food and drunk my beer several times when she came over, and I have voiced my opinion about her to my roommate regularly. My roommate's response has always been ""as long as I'm paying my part of the rent, the company I keep is between them and me."" 

On Saturday night, she invited her friend over. As I often am in my room, I was completely naked, lying over my covers, reading a book. I like being naked and expect a reasonable amount of privacy from civilized people. 

When my roommate was in the bathroom, my door door flew open like it was rammed by a siege engine. Her friend had barged in to ""surprise"" me, and instead of frantically apologizing for violating my privacy (and seeing me naked), she burst out laughing as I fumbled to cover myself. By now my roommate had come out of the bathroom, and her friend shouted to her ""I saw his little ____!"" My roommate snort-laughed loudly.

The next morning my roommate was hung over, and so I told her that her time in the house was over and that she had a month to vacate. I looked up the laws in my state, and since I am the only person on the lease, I can legally kick her out as long as I give her proper notice. She told me that she warned her roommate about privacy after what happened, and I told her I don't care at all. She brought that woman into the house, she was entertained by my embarrassment, and I wasn't comfortable living with her for another day. I told her if it were legal I'd kick her out that second.

My roommate has been nasty with me all week, saying that she has nowhere to go. I don't care and keep telling her that she might want to start looking. Our mutual friend who I originally did the favor for has sided with her completely, and so I just blocked him.

AITA for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?,"Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so.

AITA for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended,"I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

For any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

One day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL."" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

I told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

I tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?

Long story short, she couldn't take it anymore and told me that she feels really uncomfortable knowing that there is a cat lurking around and that she wouldn't come to my place again if I didnt get rid of my cat. We tried therapy but it looks like the therapy is for me to cope with the loss of my pet.,

I don't want to give my cat away so last saturday we talked about this and broke up ..Now I feel like shit for ruining my relationship. AITA?

AITA for going out in a pair of shorts?,"So I (23M) am covered in burn scars over every inch of my body with the exception of my face, neck and back. For context, my house went on fire when I was 10 and I was lucky to survive. It was obviously traumatising and after a long time of hating my body, I became an alcoholic in my teens to cope. When I was 20, I went drunk driving, crashed my car and my right leg was amputated from the knee and I’ve worn a prosthetic leg ever since.

Since it’s March, the weather is warmer now and I had to go out to get some standard shopping so I on instinct wore a jumper and shorts with it as it’s not cold out. On full display was my prosthetic and my badly scarred left leg. I should  also note I received a skin graft on that leg, so some of the skin is more visible and scarred than other portions.

Anyway, I decided to take a little walk before going to the store and I cut through a park. There isn’t much people around but there’s a few out. I got a couple of stares but that’s normal and I got to the store. I browsed for the stuff I needed like normal and when I got to checkout, there was a huge queue. I was expecting this so I was waiting and eventually, a mom and her son of about 3/4 went in line behind me. Nothing was said but I could feel the kid staring at me and he eventually started crying.

I then get a pat on my shoulder from the mom asking if I’d let them go in front of me so they wouldn’t have to stare at my “deformed leg” and my “robot one” as I was really upsetting her kid. I got really offended and told her that I wasn’t letting her skip and that some people happen to have visible deformities and that I’m allowed to wear shorts. My turn eventually came but she called me an AH and being inconsiderate to her kids feelings.

AITA for leaving during my wife’s labor?,"My wife went into labor around 6 pm on Sunday. We were expecting twins.

It quickly turns into a very painful process she kept cutting off the blood pressure to my hand when she squeezed and nearly sprayed my shirt with vomit.

Around 3 am my dad calls. I work for my dad’s company and we had a presentation for clients Monday morning that I had to get ready for.

My dad heard my wife was in labor but told me he needed me on this presentation. He said there was nothing I could do to help my wife and delivery and seeing the baby come out was overrated and people don’t prepare your for the gore.

He said he needed me to rest up and make myself presentable for the presentation.

My wife’s labor was progressing very slowly and we were all certain she would need forceps or other assistance to deliver the babies. 

I realized that I couldn’t help her here, and my dad was counting on me, so I told her I needed to leave.

She started screaming at me so loudly that a few nurses rushed over to our room.

I ended up doing the presentation with the clients and things went well.

I leave the office and see a text on my phone that said my wife delivered an hour ago at around 10:30 am and they had to use forceps. 

I would have missed the meeting had I stayed and my dad has given me everything he could possibly give me in life, so I didn’t want to let him down. 

AITA? I had responsibilities I had to take care of and while my wife is still screaming at me saying that she was alone when they “ destroyed her body”, I’m the only one who works and her mom herself said that she was emotional and overreacting. 

My wife even went as far to say that her family would disown her if she was the first of them to divorce but that she doesn’t consider me her husband right now.",Asshole
WIBTA if I said something to my sons prek about him not getting a single egg at their egg hunt today?,"So I'm pretty pissed off right now. My son is 3 and goes to a pre k program with some kids upt age 5. Today they had a nice Easter egg hunt. I had to work today so I couldn't attend but they asked each kids parent send at least 14 eggs for the hunt. I love school functions like this. I wish I could have been there. So we sent some extra eggs with him and some cupcakes. His father got there late. Well he just texted me saying he didnt get one damn egg. The bigger kids just steam rolled the smaller kids and all had 30+ eggs each. He said he got there right when they started and our son was pushed over by the bigger kids and just started crying. He didnt get a single egg. The teachers didnt supervise this at all. I'm not saying he needed a lot of eggs, but one fucking egg. Hes the only kid with no eggs. My SO said they're now sitting there our so  is crying as all the other kids are opening eggs. I'm beyond pissed they didnt supervise this better.

AITA for telling someone who called me fat that I had a miscarriage?,"I F26 just had a miscarriage. I was far enough along I had put on about 15 pounds. I went to visit a friend and when he saw me he said ‘boy you’ve put on some weight since I last saw you” and I snapped and told him that I just had a miscarriage a week ago and hadn’t lost the baby weight yet. 

Every single time he sees me he feels the need to comment on my weight and I got sick of it. I had an eating disorder and was too skinny when we met so I’ve put on weight since then. I think it’s something you really shouldn’t comment on unless someone specifically asks you to. 

Anyway, he said that it was uncalled for and then his wife said the same thing and they asked me to leave.

AITA for refusing to call my dad’s girlfriend ‘mom’ or obeying her rules?,"Edit:

Wow!! I’ve never expected this post to blow up like this. I expected about 10 reactions 

First of all: Thank you so so much for your comments, all of the amazing advise and support, and all of the DM’s. (and the rewards!)  You are amazing people and its actually hard for me to put in words how I feel about this. It’s great to read all kinds of opinions on this! though I haven’t been able to read all comments and DM’s yet

My current plan is to firstly have a talk alone with my dad. I want to share my feelings with him about this situation. Then I want the three of us (without my brothers) to talk. If that doesn’t work, I’ll try to find a professional to help us out to find a solution :) One way or another, I’ll find someone to support me in the mourning process. I’ve already contacted my uncle for help. 

TBH I am kinda overwhelmed by the number of comments and DM’s and this is not an easy process for me. Sorry if I’m slow to respond :) 

\---------------------------------------

Original post:

Throwaway because some people might recognize me.

I (17M) currently live in my fathers house, my brothers (13 and 11) live there too. I’ve always had a great bond with my mother, but she died about two years ago, which deeply traumatized me.

Half a year later, my dad started to date someone else, let’s call her Elise (32f), she’s currently living at our place as well. Don’t get me wrong, Elise is not a bad person. My brothers really needed someone to cling to and she really takes good care for them. She makes dad smile again.

However, she is a lot more controlling than my mom was. I am quite independent, do chores around the house, have friends and go out etc. But she insists that I should follow her rules, to be home at a certain time etc. I don’t like that. I’m used to have more freedom and am actually planning to move out next year, I don’t want to risk losing my friends over her controlling behavior. I am respectful towards her, trying not to pick a fight, but she’s not someone I would want to share me feelings with.

She also insists that I call her ‘mom’ like my brothers do but I refuse. For me there was only one mother in my life and calling Elise mom just feels wrong, as if I’m forgetting my real mom. I also feel like if I call her mom I would accept that she has authority over me, but I never chose this person, my dad did. My dad just wants everyone to get along and live a happy new family but is afraid of confrontation and in general just lacks a spine. He also doesn’t like it if anyone mentions my real mom so I can barely talk to him about her.

Elise has called me an unruly teenager multiple times. When I got home ‘late’ she gets angry. Among other things she’s told me at times that I refuse to accept her even though she’s trying, that I am the one thing stopping this family from being happy again. That I’m confusing my brothers by refusing to call her mom (which I doubt). I told her she should accept that I’m not a kid, that I’m still getting over the loss of someone she hasn’t even met. That the only mom I ever had is not here anymore and that if anyone could set rules on me, it would be my dad. One time when she was furious she told me to ‘get over it already’. I told her to go fuck herself, she has no idea what I went through.

AITA for telling my mother that it's her own fault she'll never get biological children?,"Edit: Just noticed the error in the title... **Grandchildren

I'm in my early thirties. I got my first period when I was nine years old and they've always been.. gruesome. More blood than anyone could ever imagine, cramping so bad that I had to miss school and couldn't eat or drink or do anything because the pain was so bad. 

In my mother's eyes... I was a faker. Making things up for attention or to get out of tests. She refused to take me to see doctors or anything. I wasn't even allowed pain meds. 

Well, when I moved in with my then boyfriend at 27, he convinced me to GO SEE A DOCTOR because that wasn't healthy. And I did. I later got diagnosed with a rare reproductive issue (vague for privacy) that essentially could have been fixed if caught earlier. But it wasn't. The issue had gone on for long enough that the damage was pretty almosy irreparable. In the end, I was basically given the choice of surgery A, which would leave me infertile, with less complications and a lower fatality rate, or surgery B, which would leave me fertile, but with a higher risk of complications/death due to the severity of my issue.

I chose surgery A. I can no longer have biological children. My then boyfriend and I are now married, and we're looking into other options to have a child. We're heavily leaning towards adoption, and I confided in my mother about this. 

Big mistake. She started scolding me and basically told me that I HAD to have biological children. She told me if I didn't have bio kids then I was a failure of a woman, and ""HOW DARE YOU LET THE BLOODLINE DIE!"" or something like that. She told me that if we adopted, then she would do everything in her power to make me and my husband look like terrible people so it fails. 

And, the icing on the cake, she told me that I should just ""Reverse The Surgery."" I can't do that. It's physically impossible. It's not like getting my tubes tied. I literally no longer have a uterus or ovaries or any of it. There is NO WAY TO ""reverse"" this surgery. 

I went off on her. I explained that, and I explained that if she were a competent parent who actually did her job, then I wouldnt be infertile. I explained that if she had taken me to see doctors sooner, I wouldn't have to consider adoption. I called her a terrible mom and a terrible person, and I told her that if I ever do adopt a child, she would never get to meet them. 

She went silent, and then hung up. Hasn't said a word to me since. But now every woman in my family is calling me a useless bitch and a horrible daughter. Even family I havent seen since I was a baby. Now I'm wondering if I went too far or something. 

Reddit, AITA?

Edit: Something several people have brought up now is how come I didn't go to the doctor before I was 27. 
For nine years my mom told me that I was overreacting and that I was a faker and that what I was going through was normal, I was just overreacting. That kind of conditioning is really hard to get over. And for a long, long time my mom was the only woman in my life who was actually aware of periods and things.  Sure, if id gone earlier, my condition likely wouldn't have been as bad, but I still would have suffered. Honest to God, I had no one in my life to tell me that my symptoms were absolutely not normal. Until I moved in with my husband. He witnessed firsthand what one of my periods looked like and told me that if I didn't go to see a doctor, he'd drag me to one by my belt loops. My point is, I never went to see a doctor before I was 27 because I was brainwashed into thinking I was overdramatic.

Edit 2: WOW. this got a lot more attention then I thought it would. So, I'm gonna comment on some stuff. 

1) Thanks for the awards! 

2) To everyone wishing me well, thank you so much, I appreciate all the kind words. 

3) to all the women and men who've had to deal with undiagnosed health problems and/or toxic families, my heart bleeds for all of you. I hope the best for all of your life situations. 

4) If you think you have a medical issue, especially if you're female, stick to it. Go to a doctor, two doctors, five doctors. Find someone who will listen to you. Admittedly, I struck gold in that my doctors actually listened to me and were speedy about diagnosing me, but many aren't. Remember, you know your body better than anyone and if something is wrong, push the issue! 

5) I am going to look into therapy- I feel like I absolutely could benefit from it. This post and some of the comments are making me consider some of my mother's behavior through my life and I really need to think things over about her and my plans going forward. I'm considering limited contact unless she can prove she deserves otherwise.

6) Yes, my husband is amazing and I'm so lucky to have him 💞

7) I've messaged most of my extended family explaining to them my side of the story. Most haven't seen the message yet, but the majority of the ones who have read it have apologized to me for not asking my side of the story first. 

8) Should I have gone to the doctor before age 27? Yes. Would it have lessened the severity of my issue? Most likely. Why didn't I? Because my mother gaslit me. I fully accept that I should've gone. But I didn't because of her actions in my teenage years. I consider her at least half to blame in this aspect.

9) Do I think I'm an asshole? Now, no! When i wrote this, and before? Of course I did. Half my family was bullying me. Sue me.",Not the A-hole
AITA for contacting my aunt's EX when she wouldn't pay me for the damages their son did?,"My(16) aunt and her husband just got divorced, I don't know the full details but my father mentioned that he cheated, actually, non of my business. They have a son(9) who is currently living with my aunt.


My parents invited my aunt and cousin over to our place  for a short stay because they have been under stress. I was supposed to play with my cousin as the adults have their conversations but we have nothing much in common, so I let him play on my laptop instead.


He was playing some web games as I surfed on my phone nearby and he suddenly lost it. He slammed on the keyboards hard and swiped the laptop off the desk. When I picked it up the screen was broken, it was pixilated all over with a white crack across the middle. I yelled at him a little before my parents stopped me, telling me to be nice as he is just upset because of recent events. My aunt just kept telling him ""It's all right. "" and din't even look at me.


I had the screen and keyboard fixed. The warranty covered the keyboard but not the screen, so it cost around $400. My parents gave me $100 to cover part of it but the rest was ""my fault"", which I didn't agree, I never asked to babysit an angry kid nor ask him to destroy my laptop. They made it sure that they were not going to give me more, so I asked my aunt instead, and got a scolding from them for being insensitive.


Insensitive or not, $300 isn't a small sum for me and since I figured nobody would pay me, I decided to contact my aunt's EX husband instead. After all, my cousin is his son too, so it's worth a try.


In short, he did pay me the full bill, in which I returned the $100 back to my parents, but they were all fuming when they found out about it. It was like a great humiliation to my aunt, unhealthy for my cousin or something like that. Maybe its bad but I don't really have much empathy for them, so AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not taking a joke that my boyfriend made?,"On mobile, sorry... 

My boyfriend and I met a few friends for drinks this evening. He was finishing some work, so I left the flat first, and he met up with us later on. On our walk home, he abruptly asked me if I had the key. 

Small context: our lock recently broke and until it’s properly replaced, we have a temporary lock and only one key. Typically the rule is that the last person to leave the flat takes the key, unless we know that one of us will be home earlier. 

I said I didn’t, because I assumed he would take it, as he left the flat last.

He became extremely upset and agitated. He demanded why I hadn’t taken the key, and said that he was sure I’d used it last and so must have lost it or misplaced it, causing him to forget it. He repeatedly said things along the lines of “we’re fucked because of you, you realise that?” and “I can’t believe you did this.” 

Towards the beginning, I assumed he was joking and laughed a little, which prompted him to snarl “you think this is a fucking joke?? You locked us out! You lost the key!” 

This continued for over five minutes. By the time we got to the flat, I was nearly crying. We stood outside of the flat for another few minutes while my boyfriend berated me. He made me peek over one of the windows, to look at the space where we normally leave the key. He said, “It’s not there, is it? Right. And whose fault is that?”

I sat down on the front steps and was burying my face in my hands and thought I was going to be sick. Finally he said, “Alright then. Let’s go inside.” When I looked up, he was taking the key out of his pocket. It was all a joke.

He’s now genuinely angry at me because I went directly to shower and have been very quiet for the remainder of the evening. He says I can’t take a joke. I hate being the humourless bitch, but I really feel this went beyond a joke. 

Am I being an overly sensitive asshole? 

Tl;dr: Boyfriend spent 5-10 minutes berating me for losing the key. Turns out he had the key. I’m hurt and annoyed. AITA?

EDIT: I went to sleep and woke up to all of this, and my post is locked for some reason so I’m not able to reply. I promise to read everything and reply to all the DMs! I’m sorry if it looks like I’m ignoring everyone!!!


Editing this on 5 July because the post is locked and I can’t reply to anyone....

- We’ve had an on and off relationship for about two years now. I’m usually the one to “come back” because I have dependency issues and miss him too much. 

- Stuff like this happens frequently. His inability to apologise is his worst trait. The incident in the post hit different because I truly felt I did nothing wrong and couldn’t believe things fell apart so fast. 

-  I spoke with him about it the following morning. He said he wasn’t to blame for my overreaction and that I owed him an apology for giving him a hard time over a joke. We didn’t speak for most of the day and now things are more or less back to normal.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?,"Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She’s babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

Her laptop no longer switches on. She’s blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn’t have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She’s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she’ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don’t feel as though it’s my responsibility.. AITA?

EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he’d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she’d be able to spend time with him. It wasn’t just ‘babysitting’ but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as ‘payment’ for watching my son.

AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for making me lie to my friends because she got her period?," Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2 years. She has always been very neat, tidy, and very polished. She cares about her appearance, and I appreciate that.

So this situation makes no sense to me.

We were at a very fancy event with a few of my friends (social distancing rules, every one wore masks etc.) My girlfriend was wearing a beautiful white dress, which I recently bought for her. The dress was very expensive.  We were all having a good time.

However, at one point, she excused herself to go the bathroom, and then I didn't see her again until she sent me a text from the car asking if we could go home.

Obviously I'm slightly annoyed because I didn't want to leave so soon. When I reached the car and asked why she wanted to go home, she told me that she got her period unexpectedly. I asked why she didn't bring extra tampons or pads (or use those tracking apps) she tried to defend herself by saying that she did everything she could, and that she had a period stain, and didn't want to stay because of the stain. 

She asked me to lie to my friends, and tell them that she was feeling  ""unwell"" so that she could go home. She had a man's jacket (a mutual friend of ours) covering her legs (and the nasty stain) and pleaded with me to take her home so she could shower and unwind.

I took her home and lied to my friends. When she was getting out of the car, the stain was very noticeable, it was very big and essentially ruined an expensive dress which I bought. She also made me purposefully lie because she wasn't prepared enough, and made me miss an event with my friends. Needless to say, I was extremely pissed. 

She said I was not being considerate and went to go lie down because she had a ""headache"" (she wanted to lie down after she took a shower)

She woke up and I haven't spoken to her properly until she apologizes, and gives back the friends jacket. I don't think I'm an AH, but when I told my friend (the same friend who gave her a jacket) he told me that I was the AH, and my GF kind of agreed.

AITA?

EDIT: I guess I'm the AH. I logged out of this account about an hour after posting because the response was terrible, and then came back to a TON of responses calling me the AH.

After my girlfriend came home from returning the jacket, she apologized for ruining the dress and I apologized for being a dumbas and not understanding the whole 'period' thing. She forgave me, then we went out for ice cream and rewatched her favorite movie. That's the end of the story.",Asshole
AITA? I cut somebody's water off as they were wasting it,"30 years ago my grandfather dug a well. It supplies our home and has a pump to supply water to a mini water tower thing to give our homes water pressure.

Another person built a house nearby and there was an agreement for them to plumb into our fresh water supply for limited domestic use: Cooking, cleaning, toilets etc. This agreement has stood for 10 years without any problems.

So what's been going wrong? 

The house next door was sold.

It's now starting to get hot. So the next door neighbour has been filling a swimming pool. I don't see a problem with this. What I do see a problem is they fill the pool and drain it EVERY SINGLE DAY.

Based on my calculations they're wasting close to 400,000 litres of water every single day. 

When I told them they can't waste water like this. They told me to f*** myself because the water is free and nobody owns it.

So I gave them a warning showing that the water supply belonged to us and it wasn't free at all. I was told to f*** off again. I watched as they filled their pool again AND drained it again. 

I simply turned off their turned off the valve supplying their home which is on our land. They now have no water whatsoever as they tried to fill their pool again this morning.

They're now complaining and whining about not having any water. I told them they can get a tanker to come and fill their pool and supply them.

AITA for asking my dad to get me feminine products because my boyfriend refused cos he felt too embarrassed?,"I’m currently on my period and have some bad cramps today. My whole body is aching and I’m feeling very low energy. 

I’m nearly running out of pads so I kindly asked my bf if he could go down to the local store to get me some pads, chamomile tea and painkillers. He started huffing and puffing and said he wouldn’t get “that stuff” for me. I asked him why and he said it’s too embarrassing. 

I didn’t have the energy to argue so I texted my dad and asked him if he could get “*that stuff*” for me. He lives nearby and is currently WFH (he was on his lunch break). Fortunately he arrived within 15 minutes and got me everything I needed and then some. 

My BF got so pissed. He said that just because he refused, it doesn’t mean that I should go running to my dad. I asked him why that’s an issue and he didn’t fully explain himself. He just said that it’s HIS job to get me stuff like that which makes no sense because I asked him and he refused.

AITA for suggesting that a friend that doesn’t like being in the presence of drinking shouldn’t make a habit of going to bars?,"A group of my friends enjoy going out to see music performed at a variety of local bars and pubs. One of my friends loves music, however doesn’t drink herself and doesn’t like being in the presence of people that are drinking. We have made the nights out to see music a bit of a habit, and as of recently this one friend has expressed more and more discomfort with the fact that the rest of us choose to drink when we attend such places. Now nobody has ever gotten to the point where they need to be babysat or become unruly, but we do often have multiple drinks in one night and enjoy taking shots. The uncomfortable friend has started asking others not to come with us so she can enjoy the music without being surrounded by drinking, and has tried to enforce a two drink maximum amongst the friend group. AITA for suggesting that she can’t really tell people not to come to a public place and that if she is so bothered by drinking that bars probably aren’t a good place for her to make plans to attend? And that her discomfort is her own problem and not everybody else’s?

Edit to add clarity:
Drinking nights out certainly aren’t the only entertainment for this group. One of us has a pool that we hang out at, we spend time swimming in a nearby lake, kayaking, visiting restaurants, one of us is always inviting others to work out with her. Her and I will go out to see music sometimes separate from the bigger group where I’ll order a beer but won’t be taking shots by myself. I am totally game for a sober night, as I believe the rest of the group would be if the setting wasn’t at a bar. I can’t remember the last time (if ever) the friend in question has planned anything or suggested any sort of plans to the group. Between ride share and enough of us going out where one person can commit to being the DD and rotate responsibilities, drinking and driving hasn’t been a problem for the group.

WIBTA If I don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?,"

Some background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

This is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

Here's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. 


Now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. 

This is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
No matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

I can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. 

I do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

But this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million.

"AITA for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?","So, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200B;

I've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""Money"" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

Last year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

Well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

AITA for telling my pregnant and disabled sister that she needs to move out before baby comes?,"So I feel terrible and guilty but I also feel like I have no choice. Looking for advice and unbiased judgment.

I have a younger sister (26) who’s disabled. I won’t get into it but she’s unable to work a full time job and is on disability, which isn’t much. She’s been living with me for ~3 years. I pay for nearly everything including groceries but she chips in for utilities or takeout once in a while. 

Last year she started dating a guy and got very serious very quickly. He’s underemployed with social anxiety and lives off of a little money his parents send him each month. He also moved in with us a few months back. I live in a larger house so didn’t mind 2 more people at the time. 

Two weeks ago my sister told me she was pregnant. I was shocked. She said she’s around 1.5 months along and they’re excited to be parents. I didn’t know how to react and sat on it for a few days before approaching both of them and saying that I can’t have them raising a baby in my home. 

I basically support both of them at this stage, letting them use their own money (again, not much) for leisure things like movies or video games. I asked them how they plan on paying for a baby and they didn’t think it was a big deal. I imagine if the baby comes I’ll probably end up paying for all 3 of them. 

In the end I told both of them that they can stay with me until the baby comes, but I don’t want a baby in my home and the huge amount of responsibility that will probably fall to me. My sister cried and her bf accused me of being two faced, because they have nowhere else to go. I offered to help them pay rent for the first few months and budget for them but they’re resistant. My sister is now saying I’m essentially forcing them to give up their baby by kicking them out. I feel bad but I feel like if this keeps going I’ll be supporting an entire family on my own for who knows how long. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for sharing pictures of my bathroom after my new neighbor urinated all over my bathroom (my drywall, toilet, and trashcan)? They say they now don't feel welcome in the neighborhood.","My wife and I wanted to welcome in our two new neighbors that moved in for privacy we will call them Blake and Jeff. We had an outdoor BBQ and had some drinks. Things were going well, we were all having a good time. Jeff and I are both into BMW's so we had a lot in common. 

&#x200B;

Blake ask's if he can use the bathroom and I am like sure. He goes comes back everything's normal, and then 10 minutes later they say they have to leave. I think about an hour later I hear my wife scream, I go check the bathroom and someone URINATED EVERYWHERE, the seat was dirty, the dry wall was dirty, our carpets were wet. I get people miss but this was deliberate, and there was no attempt at all to clean the mess. The only person that went into that bathroom was Blake. 

&#x200B;

Honestly I don't know what happened, but the only time I could imagine that would upset them was when my wife said her brother was a cop and that he was scared of doing his job. But that's it! Like our conversation was 100% PC nothing controversial at ALL. 

&#x200B;

My wife talked to Sally and told them what happened with our neighbor. Sally didn't believe it, so my wife sent Sally the picture and then it got shared by everyone in the neighborhood. Blake and Jeff didn't even deny it, Jeff messaged me that just because we had a conflict doesn't mean I need to go tell the entire neighborhood. They said that as LGBT they face enough discrimination and now don't feel welcome in this neighborhood because we needed to snitch. LIKE WTF. We had no problem with them, we wanted them to feel welcome so we invited them over in the first place. And then they pee all over our bathroom. 

&#x200B;

I don't even get it, Like WTF. We never had any beef or problem with them and they do this. I am just confused. When we tried to respond to their text it shows never delivered so it looks like they might have blocked us? I don't know.

AITA for telling my sister she has no right to judge my career since she's never worked a day in her life?,"I was over at my grandma's house with my mum, sister, brother and 3 cousins and their girlfriends, for some backstory I'm a male midwife and I recently completed my degree and am currently doing my graduate year. I do really enjoy my job because it provides a relationship with your patients and allows a lot of flexibility and it pays pretty well too I'm 25 and making $78,123 per year I ended up doing midwifery after nursing. 

My sister has always criticized my nursing career as ""not being manly enough"" and has told me women don't like feminine guys and I'd have trouble finding a wife etc and usually, I just put up with it since I don't want to cause any drama in the house but I reached my boiling point today. For some information on my sister, she has genuinely never worked a day in her life she either mooches off her parents any boyfriends she had at the time but now she mooches off her husband I feel bad for guy ending up with my sister. 

She made another comment about my career again today and I got angry, I told her she's never worked a day in her life and she's an incompetent mooch and that a stay at home mum isn't a job which I know isn't true but keep In mind I was pissed at this point.

AITA for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?,"My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.

Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.

Thing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.

I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.

"AITA for telling a coworker I was going to ""make a baby"" and name it a name she wants?","This is the dumbest argument I've ever been involved in, and definitely the most absurd work conversation, too.

I have a friend, ""Julie"", who has just come back from maternity leave. She and I work on neighbouring desks, and the setup is that the longest part of our desks are against each other in a way that leaves us effectively sitting on opposite sides of one large desk. We were on lunch break, eating at our desks, and Julie asks me about when my husband and I are planning on having kids.

I reply ""it's in the works, hopefully within the next year. Definitely sooner rather than later""

Then another coworker, who sits on the next set of desks over, hears us talking. Her name is ""Anna"" and I'll admit that Julie and I don't really like her, and try and avoid conversations with her in general.

Anna interrupts us and says ""Hubby and I are working on having a baby right now.""

Julie says ""that's lovely.""

Anna then says something about hardly being able to wait for baby ""Joseph"".

I say ""that's a lovely name, my father is called Joseph.""

Anna then says in a light tone, but there's clearly some venom to it, ""don't you go stealing my name now"" and laughs.

I'm a bit taken aback by this, tbh. I'm not offended but it's just a bit like '... ohhhkay, never mentioned it but... sure', and it's really confusing to me because I know about a dozen Josephs, it's not exactly a unique name or something anyone could ""steal"".

Julie tries to change the subject, but there's 2 more occasions during the rest of the work day where Anna just sort of says something to me about not ""stealing her name"", both times in the same jokey but menacing tone. At this stage she's getting on my nerves.

And then Anna says right as we're leaving ""promise me you'll wait until after me so I get Joseph"", and as she says it she laughs like it's a really funny joke. Julie and I give each other a look that says we really do not get this joke and I realise that she's said I should wait until after she gets pregnant for me to get pregnant in case I ""steal"" the name Joseph.

We all head off, the three of us end up in the lift together, and Julie asks about my plans for tonight. I say, totally deadpan, ""going to make a baby. The name Joseph is so rare I'm worried someone is going to steal it if I'm not quick enough"" and Julie and I both burst out laughing.

Anna is really really offended. Cannot stress enough how livid she was after hearing me say that. Julie and I both think it's really funny but I told my sister and she says that while it was funny, I was kind of a bitch about the whole thing. I am now doubting how funny it actually was.

Am I TA?

&#x200B;

Backstory because people are asking: Anna was fine when she first started working here a couple years ago, but she was a little too ""by the book"" and got a bit email-happy with HR early on, and would send emails roughly weekly, CCing in whoever it was about, reporting Coworker X for saying she was going to vote on her way home (not allowed to talk about politics) and Coworker Y saying he was going to his niece's confirmation (not allowed to talk about religion) and stuff like that. We all just collectively stopped talking to her so she no longer had ammo for HR. She eased up around the 3 or 4 month mark when she realised it was making her pretty unpopular, but people were still cautious around her. Me, Julie, Anna and a couple other guys who work in different parts of the office are the only people still here who were here for that, and we're still cautious around her even though she hasn't emailed HR in a while. Anna has previously tried to befriend us and she's apologised for her actions in the past, but we still aren't her biggest fans. Anna's desk has the same set up as ours but she doesn't have a desk-mate because hers retired a few months ago and they haven't replaced her yet, and since then Anna has been trying to talk to us over lunch or while we're working. We've tried to keep it professional, asking if she has a certain form or if she got my (work related) email, or stuff like that, but she wants to talk about outside of work and generally get to know us. We're cautious about this because of what happened when she started working here.

&#x200B;

Also I know I could have said ""I'm not naming my child Joseph"" and been done with it but first off I'm not going to promise not to use it for the sake of a coworker I don't get on with and also it is in the running, as a middle name, along with a few other options, in the 50% possibility that I get pregnant with a boy.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I don’t let my daughter put a lock on her door?,"My daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.

I don’t like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and I’m worried she’s trying to hide something from me or that she’ll take the opportunity to lock me out. I admit that I’ve forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that I see no reason as to why she’d need a lock.

I kind of cringe looking back. She was probably just messing around but I mean... I just met you and you're being alienating like that? I don't know if that is just her style of fooling around and she wasn't trying to be a dick but at that point I felt slighted. :/

AITA for calling my brother a piss baby?,"My brother (27m) lives with my parents and I (16m). My brother is a nice guy/incel. He’s constantly ranting about how girls won’t go out with him, and how apparently they’re all dirty whores for not liking him. My parents seem to only encourage his behavior. What’s worse is he’s a gym teacher, so his female students (some of whom are my classmates) are exposed to his nasty ass attitude. 

Last night, my brother went on another long rant about the latest girl who managed to resist his ‘nice guy charm.’ He kept going on about it, and I got annoyed because of it. I told him, ‘Maybe if you weren’t such a piss baby someone would want to date you.’ (Piss baby was said because my parents have forbidden the term incel in our house. Because my brother gets upset over it. Also, it was the first thing I could come up with other than incel)

Surprise, my brother gets upset about it. My dad tells me to apologize to my brother, and I tell him I wasn’t going to apologize to a nasty ass piss baby who goes around treating people (mainly women) like shit just because he’s a ‘nice guy.’ Things escalate to where my dad, brother and I are all screaming at each other at the dinner table. It ends with me being told to find a friend to stay with for the night, because my parents (and brother) are sooo disappointed in me. I got a long voice mail telling me how disappointing I was.

AITA for choosing my biological child over my foster son?,"My husband and I never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. We've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. He's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. Just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

The child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. We were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that I was pregnant. It was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and I am now over 40. I had thought I had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

Unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. We can't financially have both children. I can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who I am already bonding with. My husband wouldn't think of it either. We have to refuse the adoption. 

Unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. Am I the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

Edit: 

Baby:
Baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

Finances:

We currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. We are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. Us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. Social services is giving us until January to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. We can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

We don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. Both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. It's a catch 22 basically.",Asshole
AITA for not breastfeeding my baby because she bites?,"My daughter, 10 months old has recently started biting during breastfeeding. When she starts to bite, I simply tell her ""no"" and put her down immediately.

Instead I've been pumping, but even that is extremely painful until I let my breasts heal. Instead I've been doing a mix of pumping and formula. My husband does not like this. He was okay with me pumping and feeding our daughter until I started supplementing with formula. He believes that breastmilk is best and formula is the devil because it's not ""natural"" or something. At this age, I'm giving her milk around 4-5 times a day, and still attempt to breastfeed once or twice a day. 

It reached the tipping point yesterday when he hid the formula so I'd have ""no choice"" but to breastfeed our daughter. 

I ask him why he's doing this, and he simply says he doesn't think I'm not trying hard enough because I stopped simply because she's biting me, and that a good mother wouldn't stop doing what's best for her child simply because she's in pain.",Not the A-hole

AITA for making my nephew a dinosaur quilt? My sister is deeply Christian,"My sister and I weren't raised religious. She went off to uni at 18 and became a Christian when she started dating another Christian. Basically the point is she doesn't believe anymore that dinosaurs exist. 

She's now married to a man who isn't religious which is a sore point for her that he won't convert. 

I have a niece (9) and a nephew (6). A couple of weeks ago while watching them, my nephew mentioned his quilt I made him was getting too short so I told them both to go into my craft room and pick some fabrics they each want on a quilt. I could easily open a fabric shop with all the fabric I have so they had a rare time picking out their fabrics. My niece went for some space/galaxy themed and my nephew picked out some dinosaur fabrics. I thought nothing of it and got to work.

Today I went over with their quilts, excited to see their reaction. They were so happy until my sister noticed my nephew's quilt and asked 'what the fuck?!'. I was confused and she quickly went on a rant about her knowing dinosaurs don't exist and how dare I try brainwash her child like that. I told her he picked out the fabric himself, I genuinely didn't make the connection and I would let him pick more fabric for a different quilt. 

By this point my nephew is crying saying he doesn't want a different quilt so my sister called my BIL in telling him to set me straight. He basically shrugged and asked what the big deal was, it's only fabric, their son likes the fabric, it's his son too and he believes in dinosaurs so he should get a say on the quilt too if it's such a big deal.

My parents are now involved and despite not being religious, they are pissed at me for what I've done.  No one but my BIL believes it was a genuine mistake or oversight and they think I've set out to mock my sister's beliefs. I honestly didn't think I'd have to vet my nephew's fabric choices with my sister as all the fabric they had access to was kid friendly prints. The stuff with swearing etc is kept elsewhere as they like going into my craft room

Aita for telling my daughter that she can't have kids while she still lives in my house,"I know it sounds bad but here's the story. I  (62f)  live with my husband (65m) who I my kids stepfather. I had 3 kids with my first husband who passed away a few years ago, they are all relatively successful. 2 of them have moved out but one still lives with me, which I don't mind, but I think it's time that they be on their own as the others are.


Oldest kid: 30 Male. Moved out years ago, lives with his wife and the recently had their first baby.

Middle Kid: 27 Female. Married for 2 years, her and her husband live with me while they save up for a place.

Youngest: 22 Female. Lives in a college dorm in another city. 

Ever since my son and Dil had their baby, my oldest daughter has been baby crazy and has been constantly talking about how she can't wait to be a mom. I love my daughter but I don't want a baby in the house. I stopped at 3 for a reason.  I don't want her to live here forever, I want her and her husband to have their own lives, while my husband and I to have our own lives by ourselves. 
A couple nights ago at dinner I sat her down and told her my reasoning and told her that if she wants a baby that badly then her and her husband need to start looking for their own place. 
She didn't take it too well and called me selfish and that I only think about myself. Which right now is true, for 30 years i've put my kids first and now I want to put myself first. I hardly think I'm selfish for that.
I tried to explain my reasoning and her husband said he understood but I know he was angry too. My husband is on my side and says I'm nta. 
For the past week my daughter and son in law have been ignoring me an only talks to me when its necessary. 

I told some friends about what happened and most understand where I'm coming from but a couple said that I am TA as it wouldn't matter because its not my baby so I wouldn't have any responsibility towards it. 

I don't know what to do, I don't want my daughter to hate me but I'm getting older and I would like for my kids to be independent while my husband and I can enjoy retirement together.

She and I aren't close. She has untreated mental health issues (I suspect BPD) that made my life hell growing up, and even in my adult years she's often tried to control my life to make it more like hers. One thing we've always disagreed on is the topic of babies.

Unfortunately for her, I'm childfree. I like kids. I even work with babies, and I'm good with them. But I've never wanted one, and I'm an only child.

I called her after the diagnosis came in to check on her, and - in tears - she declared that now is the time that I *have* to give her a grandbaby. The doctor is giving her about a year to live, perfect timing if I get pregnant now apparently. She says this is the only thing that would make her feel better about dying.

As usual, I said no. I don't want a kid. My spouse doesn't want a kid. That's it.

Now, several of my mother's friends, who in the past had supported my decision, are calling me up to say I'm TA for refusing her dying wish. They're pointing out that my spouse and I could afford a child (true) and that we already have more space in our home than we need (sort of true), and therefore the only thing that's stopping me from popping out an infant in 9 months is, in their opinion, that I'm a horrible selfish child.

To be clear, I'm not going to change my mind. A lot of factors have gone into my decision not to have babies, and a few old people calling me a self-absorbed bitch won't change that, but I'll admit that perhaps I am, in fact, a self-absorbed bitch.

AITA for giving a company my honest opinion on their interview process when they asked for it?,"I applied for a job a few months ago, it was a completely online work from home job regardless of the current situation so all communication and process was done online. This was for a retail consultant position for the online shoppers. They could seek advice from the consultant if they needed help choosing products. 

I received an email saying they would like to interview me. Sweet. I got an email link for a zoom call the next week. I had no idea how many people would be on this call or who I would be talking to. 

I join the call and there are like 30 of us on there. The hiring rep tells us all to mute ourselves as we will be listening and not talking. We proceeded to sit through a 2 hour presentation on the company history, their finances, goals, and every little gritty detail that nobody actually cares about. At the end of the presentation they told us that they had been watching our faces to see how our engagement was during the presentation to determine who would move onto the next interview step. They said they would select 5 people out of the 30 on the call. 

After the call they wanted us to write a 3 page essay about a particular topic from a list they provided us. We had 2 hours to turn it in. 

Well I did not get selected and received that email the next day. Along with that email was an attached form they wanted reviewing the interview process with a blank box at the end to “give them our honest opinion on the interview process”. 

I told them honestly that I found it a bit inappropriate and not very well organized that I had to dedicate 5 hours of my time to an interview for a position they weren’t even considering me for. I explained that had I been in the final pool of candidates it would have been fine but having me watch a 2 hour presentation on the company and write a 3 page essay just so I can be weeded out in the first step was just not the business. 

I received a nasty email back from the hiring recruiter saying that they’re glad they didn’t hire me with that kind of an attitude and just a bunch of other rude stuff. I didn’t reply. 

My bf and mom think that I was out of line and that if I really wanted the job I wouldn’t have an issue with doing all of that work. Again I wouldn’t if I was actually being considered for employment but I just found it weird that I had to go through all that as a preliminary screen. AITA?

EDIT: a lot of people are telling me this is an MLM/pyramid scheme. It looks like it, but it definitely wasn’t. I found the job on indeed, they are a company similar to Ulta/Sephora who sell their own products as well as other brands. The job was basically to be like an online Sephora employee where people could request help matching foundation shades, asking skincare questions etc.

AITA for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?,"I live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them.

AITA for no longer giving a struggling neighbour food?,"When my (30F) husband and I got our first house I became friendly with our neighbour who had two young children, 2 & 3 (they're now 7  & 8) 

Early on I noticed she was stressed, she was working from early to late (I had noticed she was getting home at like 10pm-11pm) 

I started to ""accidentally"" cook extra, I'd bring over Sheppard pies, meat pies, fish pie etc, I'd ""accidentally"" have too many steaks or food that was about to go off and this led to the children just having dinner at ours.


We recently discovered our daughter (3F) has a meat allergy so everything has been swapped to a veggie option, me and my partner have decided it will make life a whole lot easier to make the switch with her - to put it bluntly, I'm not cooking two meals.

We usually avoid soya and just do vegetables, vegetable lasagne, mushroom burgers etc, broccoli and kale mac n cheese.

Well neighbour decided to complain that I was trying to ""convert"" her children who now refuse to eat food she cooks.

So, I've stopped cooking for her.

She apologized and has asked me to cook but she's never appreciated what I've done for her and complaining has just pushed it all over the edge.

My husband thinks I'm being an AH and that she was just being a concerned parent and clearly feels bad about accepting my charity.

AITA For making my little sister walk home.,"So recently I got my license and my dad thought it would be a good idea for me to drive my little sister home. She would normally walk speaking she falls right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. The first few days went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting her music. I took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. She replied with a snarky what and I asked her why she unplugged my phone. She responds with ""I got tired of listening to your music"". I told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving. Then she gets bold and while I'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. When my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks I was justified. From my POV she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. I understand it is a little thing but I gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.

AITA if I back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? Best man is my ex fiancé who cheated on me and I can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.,"Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fiancé for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

I confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

And on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

I've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

Woukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?

Edit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I’m so sorry I haven’t been reading I’ll try and catch up

Edit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""Panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


Edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiancé not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiancé to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister the only reason her BF is with her is because of his fetish .,"My sister (25f) and I (22f) grew up in the deep south, my dad is almost 400 lbs and my mom is close. I grew up as a fat kid however when I started college and moved to a very fitness friendly state (CO) I lost alot of weight. I started to care more about my looks. I became a personal trainer last year and got a rhinoplasty recently to fix my crooked humped nose. My sister decided to move up with me. My sister was not very approving of my weight loss nor was she happy I did alot to change my appereance. While we get along wonderfully most of the time we still have fights about her thinking I'm vain. My sisters weight is around 300lb, I have offered her help however she just tells me life isnt about looks. Frankly I dont care what she looks like I just want her to be healthy and confident.

&#x200B;

My sister sometimes acts out at me alot especially when it comes to guys. When we have gone to bars people can be cruel saying ""what youre sisters couldnt tell"" or outwardly paying more attention to me. I defend her when I see it but it still hurts her confidence she has cried to me multiple times about dating asking why cant anyone accpet her for who she is. In Jan my boyfriend of 2 yrs cheated on me. My sister told me that maybe he left me because I was too vain and high maitinence. I ignored her. Around the time of the break up she started dating a guy, and I was happy for her. However the guy gave off some weird vibes, the way he looked at my sister when she ate and making plans when my sister and I are supposed to do healthy activities. Since then my sister has gained a massive amount of weight and has become more hostile towards me. Her boyfriend buys her large quantities of unhealthy food and insists that she needs to eat more, he is weirdly touchy with her and often dismisses things she says. They dont talk and just watch tv, she hasnt met his friends or family yet also. She complains how he never posts about her on social media. About a month ago I had a friend over, this friend is interested in fetishes and they regonized my sister's bf from a feeder site, I didnt want to bring it up with my sis because that didnt seem like it was my place but it worried me greatly.

&#x200B;

I recently downloaded multiple dating apps and my sister like any sister wants to see who I matched with, I showed her and she immediatly said the only reason I got these matches is because I'm shallow. She then told me I might be more sucessful if I stop worrying so much about my looks and said that her boyfriend loves her for her personality not her looks and girls who look really good get men who want them just for their looks. This angered me to the point where I told my sis that her boyfriend is a feeder and he doesnt love her if he did he would put her health over his fetish and actually want to introduce her to the people in his life.

AITA for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by “mistake”?,"My grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. Before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what I’d like. Instead of jewelry I asked for her wedding dress. No one else wanted it, I had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. After talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. 

When she did pass away I was surprised she hadn’t written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn’t go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

Since I wasn’t there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. 

When I got the ring I didn’t examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It’s value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. 

Now, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it’s fair. I didn’t ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?

AITA for letting my sons girlfriend sleep in his room,"So I’m a single dad of my 19 year old son. He’s been dating a girl from his college since the beginning of freshman year, and when he came back she asked if she could stay with me instead of her parents. I thought about it pretty deeply because I didn’t really know how I felt about it at first, but I have a lot of extra space and I figured if I said no they’d try and see each other anyway despite the stay at home orders. I’ve been treating it as close to a regular roommate situation as I can, although he is my son so it’s not quite the same, but my house is big enough that they can keep to themselves without bothering me.

And not that I’ve been trying to listen to their conversations, but from what I’ve heard they’re very good for each other. They’re always very happy and nice to each other and there doesn’t seem to be any conflicts.

Anyway when she first moved in her parents had a meltdown, they called me and demanded I kick her out and make her go home. I told them I wasn’t going to do that and if she wants to leave she’s free to. She has her own car and it’s only a 45 minute drive to her home town. They berated me over the phone a few times and then finally gave in and let her stay. 

Apparently she let it slip over video chat that they’ve been sleeping in the same room(I don’t really know what her parents expected when she moved in with him... but ok) and they called me again and demanded I separate them. I told them that again if she wants to leave I’m not keeping her, she has the means to go home, it’s not like I’ve locked them in the same room. And there’s a third spare bedroom that she can stay in if she decides she for some reason does want to be separated. 

They said that I know what they’re doing in there and that it’s a tragedy that I’m endorsing it. From my point of view is they’re both the same age, technically adults, they can serve in the military, I’m sure whatever they do in there they were doing at college. They’re old enough to decide for themselves what they want to do.

WIBTA if I cut my boyfriend off financially after he ignored my basic requests?,"Also posted in the advice subreddit. I'm 26F, he is 27M and we have been together for 8 years. 

I was in a bad car wreck a few months ago after getting T-Boned by a Semi. Because of this I got a check for almost $19k, as well as a brand new vehicle. I practically begged my boyfriend multiple times not to tell anyone we received the money because both of our families suck and like to mooch off of us, even though we are the ones struggling financially and we are the ONLY ones who lost our jobs to Covid. We got laid off within a week of eachother and were both denied for unemployment. So it's been rough. 

I received the check from the accident 3 days ago. He instantly went and paid $100 to his sister that we owed her and apparently she asked where he got money and despite me telling him not to, he told her I had gotten my check. He instantly told me about it and said that he felt ""cornered"". His sister has that affect on people so I tried to push it out of my mind even though I was peeved. 

Since that point I have gotten phone calls from all 3 of his brothers, his 2 sisters and even his uncle who I have never even met, due to him living out of state. All of them were asking for money. I hold true to my restrictions and didnt allow anyone to borrow anything because I know they will NOT pay me back and I have more important shit to do with my money (pay bills, rent, pay off my car loan and student debt and put away a big chunk so I can save for a home). 

The final straw was this morning. I wake up to a call from an unknown number at around 530am and it's his father. Hes like ""Hey Champ, how you doing? How are you recovering?"" So I gave him the run down. Well, before he hangs up he says ""So Julie (my boyfriends sister) told me you got your money. Peter (his step son) turns 5 today and I didnt get my paycheck and I'm fighting with payroll about it. Can you spot me $500?"" I instantly hung up and confronted my boyfriend about it.

I told him my basic requests were ignored and that I felt disrespected and that I didnt want people knowing for this exact reason. He told me I was blowing it out of proportion and that I could simply tell them no. I explained that that was besides the point and that I wanted to avoid having to turn people away left and right. He still thinks I'm overreacting. 

So now I am at a loss where a part of me wants to cut access to my check from him entirely since he cant even follow basic requests. Hes not spending the money or anything like that, especially without asking first but the fact that he told people after I practically begged him not to sits really heavy on me. A part of me knows he is right and that I could just say no but I dont want to have to do that. WIBTA if I cut off his access to this money?

EDIT: I truly did not expect this to blow up the way that it did! I went to visit my mom shortly after posting and neglected to check it again until this morning so I have over a thousand notifications. I'm slowly going through all of them and if I dont directly respond to you, I apologize!

EDIT: I'm actually going to jump back off this post because now I am becoming slightly irate at people jumping to assumptions without asking for info. First and foremost (I only ready maybe 100 comments), me telling my boyfriend not to discuss my financial matters with his family is not me being controlling, at all. This is my money, not his families, and some shit is on a need to know basis. This is not something they needed to know, period. Secondly, no, him keeping this information isnt something that would have made him uncomfortable. He has no problem withholding this sort of info from my family but when it comes to his own, it's a complete double standard. This has also happened in the past with my tax return money as well, which coincidentally I happened to be conned out of nearly $8k by the same sister in question. She never paid us back. This is also the same family that saw that I needed a place to stay while getting my new home situated and knowingly pushed all their Bill's on me, resulting in me being $1200 in the hole by the time I left their house. My boyfriend doesnt mind these things. But as I said, hes all for helping his family while telling my family to basically go fuck themselves.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making a complaint against a nursery worker due to how she reacted to my wife picking our kid up?,"My wife (36) and I (37M) have 2 kids, a daughter (8) and a son (3). My wife is an essential worker as she’s a doctor. She works extremely long hours with hardly any days off whilst I work a typical 9-5 job so I’ve always taken care of arranging the kids for school and care etc.

Well with lockdown, I’ve been able to homeschool my daughter but since my wife is an essential worker, my sons nursery has still been able to take him in so I have dropped him off there as normal as even though I’m homeschooling my other kid, I’m fitting that around me working from home. It makes it easier for my son to still have his routine and so I can do my work and so on.

Anyway, I was going to pick him up like normal but my wife chose to do it as she was off at that time and could actually get him. The people at this nursery know my wife as do the parents even though she’s rarely there. She was actually happy to be able to pick our son up from nursery for once and I thought it went fine until she came home in tears.

She told me this nursery worker who has just started there didn’t believe that my wife was our sons mother as this worker had only ever seen me. The other workers and my son told her that my wife was in fact the mother and that she wasn’t a danger to my son. The new worker still didn’t believe it and said that she didn’t feel comfortable with letting a 3 year old go off with a random woman she’d never seen before. My wife got really upset and it in then upset my son as everybody was practically saying there was no danger as my wife was a mother. A few other parents got dragged into this and backed up the other staff and it was only through relenting that the new worker gave up but she made a really angry comment along the lines of, “maybe if you were here more often, I wouldn’t have to verify your identity.”

My wife wants to forget it happened but I am very angry so the next day I picked up my son and asked to speak the woman in charge about the new worker. She wasn’t there when it happened but I complained and said that how my wife was treated was ridiculous and that the coworker was out of line for her snide comment at the end. The woman wasn’t happy and I’ve now learnt the new worker has been given a severe warning and that her behaviour is being watched.

The parents who backed my wife up are torn. Some think I did the right thing as the woman didn’t act professional whilst others think I’m an Ah for interfering. My wife is annoyed as she thinks I shouldn’t have said anything. I really don’t know if what I did was right or wrong so am I the AH?",Not the A-hole
AITA for letting my picky eater child go hungry?,"My four year old has decided to become a picky eater. He doesn't have autism or anything else that causes sensory issues, he's just picky now, he used to be willing to eat anything. If he had his way he'd only eat french fries and Goldfish. Obviously I'm not going to let him only eat those two things. I'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. What I've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, I'll just say something like ""Alright, I guess you can eat this later"" and put the food in the fridge. If he asks for a snack, I offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk; at the next meal, I'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. He carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. He's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did I'd probably feed him something else. My mom friends are horrified I'd do this to my kid, and tell me I'm old fashioned.

\-I do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.

I love dogs. We have a rescue pittie we've had for 8+ years+ a foster.

I see an 'old' man (his words, early 60s), chatting with my neighbour. His dog has no leash. His dog peed on the side of my car! I grab a bucket+shampoo+sponge, 'n walk outside.


Neighbour: Hello OP, washing the car again? 


Me -friendly-: Actually, your mates dog just peed all over my cars door. I would apprecia-


Man: My dog? He woulnd't do that!!


Me: Sir I just watched him do it, if you look at the door you can see the pee on there, a puddle-


Man: -NO, don't accuse my dog! Everyone here has dogs! Maybe it was your own!


Me: Again, I saw him. That golden with the red collar is your dog correct? It was thát dog.


Man -Full volume-: MY DOG DID NOT PEE ON YOUR CAR! 


Me: Well I'm certain he did, no damage done yet, it still washes off. I got you some soapy water, shoulnd't take more than a few seconds.


Neighbour: [Man] just wash it off, accidents happen.


Man: I AM NOT WASHING THIS KIDS CAR, HE CAN WASH IT HIMSELF (I do not look like a kid) 


Me: Not asking you to wash my car, just his pee!


Man: [Some trash talk] I am not your servant, MY dog did not pee on your door!  -I- am NOT washing it!


Me: So that's also not him pooping in my (different) neighbours yard then? Maybe you should walk him first, thén chat.


Man: [Dog] COME HERE.  (Dragging the dog out of the yard by his collar who was still pooping, while stepping on the plants / dragging dirt over the sidewalk. Then started walking off.)


Me: Pick up that mess! dude!!


Man: **** you!!! YOU clean it up yourself!!


Me: Stop acting like such an ***!


The man walks back and while basically telling me to go **** myself, knocks over my bucket and walks away. My sponge got sand in it and was ruined.. I ended up washing my car door, neighbour got a broom 'n cleaned the sidewalk.


Later he posted a nasty topic on a neighbourhood info/watch app, he obv didnt expect me to be on there. He fabricated a story: That I am a doghater that tried to force a reumatic 'old' man to clean his entire car, while he was just walking past. He is afraid of me now blabla. Mentioned my name/info too.

I replied with screenshots of him (security cam) With his dog peeing on my car, + picked out the worst looking screenshots of him getting in my face/ knocking over my bucket, also one of him dragging his dog away by its neck that caused a big backlash.

AITA for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?,"Alright.

I'm a European woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to San Francisco for a fancy-pants internship. It was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- I'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time I've ever been out at work.

There is one co-worker who we shall call Linda. She's a trans woman (MtF).

Linda's position means that me and she and I don't really interact at work often. Therefore, I was told about her before I met her. One of my co-workers told me that she existed, I was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. I met Linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, I thought that was the end of it.

Now, Linda does not pass as a cis woman.  She's still a woman and I'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

This now caused an issue. A few of us had a Halloween get-together and invited Linda. At some point, she and I were alone at our table. We got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative European country. At some point, I made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

Her face just fell. She started hissing at me about how dare I presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (I did NOT misgender her, at no point did I use 'he' or anything like that- I just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. Drunk idiot I was, I blurted out 'but...we all know?' Which we do.

I was extremely confused. Apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. This somehow led Linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

Linda now, and I say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. She confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare I judge her. I, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. She is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

AITA for grounding my daughter the way I did?,"So my 15-year-old daughter wanted to go hang out at a friend's place (call friend hannah) and go to the mall and then stay at the hannahs place overnight, I knew the girl and the girl's mum so I agreed. 
she packs her bag and gives me a hug and leaves. 

At around 10 I decided to text Hannah's mum to ask how it's going and she gets super confused at my question, I said you have my daughter right? she goes no, hannah is with her dad this weekend I have no teens with me atm. 

so she calls Hannah's dad to sort the situation out and he tells her that he is still at work and hannah should be home alone. 

I walk over to Hannah's mums house and we drive up to Hannah's dads. 

turns out hannah and my daughter wanted to get drunk and throw a house party with older guys, I was seeing red at this point and grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out.

 when we got home I made her hand over her phone and laptop which she has lost the privilege of having for 2 weeks (exluding school work) and she is banned from going to the shops with friends for 2 months. 

my family/ some friends are saying that's a tad harsh and now I'm worried I made the punishment to long.

AITA my boyfriend wont let me get a breast reduction?,"tl;dr: i have large breasts that have caused me nothing but back pain, and my boyfriend thinks im self centered for wanting a reduction. 

For context, I (26F) was born with unfortunately large  breasts. currently my bra size is that of a whopping 38 E. Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up. 

Starting a few months ago, the pain had only gotten worse and worse- It seemed i couldnt go an hour without having to dramatically crack my back and swallow ibuprofen and still have to suffer pain. Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.

So i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B. I wanted my back pain to be COMPLETELY gone. So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED. He told me that i was throwing away my body and ""caving in"" to ""societal pressure"". He said there was no reason to change my tit size, and that if i did, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to ""compromise"" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was ""childish"". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me. 

So, Reddit, i just need to know. Am i the asshole for this?


EDIT: 😂😂😂 I was not born with large breasts, but they are a genetic thing that ive had since i was about 16!

EDIT that im sure no one will see: As of May 15, after finally deciding to professionally measure myself, i am not a 38E, but rather, a 34H. Not sure how i could have messed up to drastically 😂 Also, I dumped the boyfriend! Good riddance",Not the A-hole
AITA for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?,"Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200B;

The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200B;

She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.

&#x200B;

Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200B;

My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200B;

I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200B;

I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200B;

After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her."" as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.

A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my dad’s wife weak?,"Backstory:

My (16F) dad and mom (both 37F&40M) got a divorce two years ago because my father cheated on my mother, her (the mistress) and my dad got married two months after my parents got a divorce.

My parents have joint custody of me and my siblings (17M & 16M (my twin brother), we’re all close and decided we wanted to visit our father, his wife and her kids (16&15F, the father passed) every two weeks since it was either that or we’d have to spend our holidays with them (mother’s orders) which we all didn’t want.

I don’t like the two teenage girls and neither do my brothers, they’ve called us the n word multiple times (our dad is Italian while our mom is black, my stepsisters&stepmom are white), usually stay out late, smoke etc.

Story:

We were at my dad’s house, my brother (twin) and I were playing video games in the living room, my stepsister (16) wanted to watch tv even though she has a tv in her room, we told her to give us half an hour since we hadn’t been playing for long, my stepsister called us both ‘ghetto n——‘ out of nowhere and my stepmother came downstairs to ask what happened.

I explained to her what happened and she told me “Anna (random name), I’ve talked to you about this, stop being weak.”

I asked her if my stepsister would be getting a consequence and she told me no because I was being weak, then added “for a black girl”.

I responded by saying, “I’m weak yet you don’t have enough respect for yourself to leave a man who forgot to tell you he had a wife and kids.” since she wasn’t aware my father had a family while he was cheating with her.

She went ballistic and my brother (17) who had just woken up had to hold her back, I feel kind of guilty but I also don’t.

Now I’m waiting for my dad to get home.

AITA?

Edit: No, my parents don’t know about the racism

Edit 2: My mother wants us to have a relationship with our father and I’m not sure if my dad is aware of the racism

AITA for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money,"My husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole “I don’t have money for gas” victim part. This money is not part of our savings or anything. Anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. During those two weeks I bought groceries for us, I paid for our take out food, I offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall I was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. He saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. He let me pay for his car insurance. He heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

Yesterday I asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and I didn’t have cash. He got really nervous when I asked him if I could borrow his debit card. He started to act strange. I asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. I asked him if he was hiding money from me? And he denied it and said I was paranoid and crazy.

He checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. He literally shouted, “wow wow wow I have extra money!!!! Oh my god this is so awesome!!” And he played the whole I didn’t know part.

He continued to argue and I told him that I don’t care about the money I care about honesty. Why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

It took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly I was going to ask for some money if I knew. He said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

Today I asked him to leave the house. I called him cruel and deceitful. I told him that I don’t want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

By the way I’m 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. We’ve know each other for 3 years.

Am I the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
I’m just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. And now I’m questioning everything in our relationship. Maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. I don’t know anything anymore.

***UPDATE****
I followed the advice I received here (thank you). He’s back home but staying in the guest room. He came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he’s apologizing profusely. We’ll be taking marriage counseling.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to support our daughter after she gives birth?,"Edit: Thank you so much for your kind responses, I've tried to read all the comments but this blew up overnight. However some general things: 
1. Our 27f daughter assumed she could live with and be financially supported by us in the year after her child was born because our eldest went through significant financial hardship when she was trying to have a baby due to paying for ivf/fertility treatments and as a result almost ended up homeless because they remortgaged their house to afford it but then her husband was in a car accident and needed time off work meaning they were unable to pay their mortgage and the bank claimed their home.
2. I dunno what I can say to convince you this is real, yes its from a throwaway because my main account has part of my real name on it and both my 27f daughter and my son and his wife are familiar with it. There were 3 edits to this post. Originally it included a couple of paragraphs about how our 27f daughter made some homophobic comments about my wife's brother getting married to another man, and also some statements she made towards the BLM movement, however that post was over the 3000 word count and i decided to remove them as they aren't applicable to the current situation and i wanted to focus more on our immediate family issue rather than get into a big lgbt/blm argument. When I reposted it the post was removed because ""this is not a debate sub"", so I changed the title and reposted it as it is.
3. My wife and i have been supporters of the blm movement since before we got married 33 years ago, I came from a very racist family who disowned my older sister for marrying a black man and then kicked me out as a 16yo for sneaking out of the house so I could go to my sisters wedding. We haven't really been LGBT supporters(we haven't been anti LGBT, just not a part of rallies/donations) until my wife's brother came out a few years ago and since then we have made more of an effort to go to parades and donation to things like the Trevor project.

Second edit to say that our 27yo daughter will not be homeless if we don't support her for the year following the birth. It was just supposed to be an opportunity for her to spend time with us as otherwise they live over 2 hours away. As far as Im aware they own their home outright and her husband is financially well off enough to support her during this time without our help. 

Also our adoptive grandson is only 9 so a bit young to understand why some parts of the family don't like him. 




I'm not going to go into real detail but essentially my 27f daughter has recently said some very racist things. Since she married her husband she seems to have changed as a person and is much more distant and vicious towards the family, things came to a head last weekend at our first big family get together since covid when she said that our eldest daughters adopted son(who is black, he was adopted because our eldest and her husband are unable to have children) ""wasnt really a part of the family"" and that ""God didn't mean for you(eldest daughter) to have children, just accept what he gave you and stop forcing your options(referring to the son) on the rest of us"". Our eldest and her son were devastated and some very heated words were exchanged before my 27yo daughter and her husband stormed out. 

Now recently our 27yo daughter has announced she is pregnant, she and her husband were planning on moving into the cottage on our property after the baby is born so my wife and I can help out for the first year. During this time our daughter doesn't plan on working and has been clear that she expects us to contribute to her financial costs during the year(we had a similar arrangement with our eldest whe she was trying for a baby, and our son and his wife also spent 6 months living in the cottage after their twins were born). However after discussing with my wife we feel that this would make the rest of the family uncomfortable with visiting us(obviously eldest and her son no longer want to cone over while 27f and her husband are here and pur sons Latina wife has also expressed her discomfort around 27f and her husband)and we are uncomfortable supporting people who are so blatantly racist. 

We told our daughter last Thursday in a zoom chat about our decision and she blew up at us, demanding to know why she wasn't allowed to express her option and arguing that we aren't black so why should we care? My wife became very upset and closed the chat and has refused to speak to our daughter since and she is blaming herself for not raising her better. Are we the assholes here?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I(24M) stopped cooking for my (24F) girlfriend?,"I've been with my gf S for 4 years, living together for 2. Off the start of the relationship I knew she was a picky eater. We would go to fancy  restaurants and she would order the simplest things or the same things over and over. It seemed weird to me but I didn't really care,she can do whatever she wants. I only really realized how annoying this is when we moved in together.

Now I on the other part I'm the opposite. I like to try new foods, new tastes and get a better idea of food in general. I also love cooking and have a culinary arts degree (I wanted to become a chef but I didn't for other reasons). So you can assume that I do almost all the cooking at home. You can see where this is going.

Only when I started cooking for S did I realize how picky of an eater she is. She hates almost everything, even if she can't really taste it in the end product. To give you some examples:

She hates cinnamon.

She hates garlic.

She hates any kind of spice. (clove, nutmeg etc)

Yesterday I was making a Spanish omelet and she complained when I added the tiniest pinch of thyme in there. Because of all the ingredients I put in there she is gonna taste the pinch of thyme. 

I made a white chocolate mousse and she complained when I layerd it with oreos(!) and strawberries, because she apparently doesn't like oreos.

No amount of zest can go into our food whether that be orange or lemon zest bacsuse it apparently tastes bitter.

She hates spicy food.

She only eats steaks or whatever well done. If there's the tiniest amount of pink in there it's raw. (I've destroyed so many good steaks in the past cooking them well done).

I could go on about this she doesn't like but we'd be here all day. Last night she asked me to cook dinner but I refused. When she asked why I explained that it's frustrating to cook for a person with the tastebuds of a 5 year old, and that she can order takeout from now on.

AITA for failing a student on the last day of class?,"FINAL EDIT AT BOTTOM:
As a side gig I teach once a week for a local university. The students come to the hospital where I work and I teach them by doing direct patient care. They also have written assignments to complete, some for me in the clinical setting and some in the classroom. Most of the students I have are seniors, so college work is not new to them. 

This semester I have a student who just has a lack of motivation and puts in little effort. Her assignments are usually submitted late, but there is nothing in the syllabus that states they can’t be turned in late for full credit 🙄 The students are also allowed to redo one failed assignment for full credit. She failed her first assignment and I have reminded her throughout the term that she has to redo it because it’s a required assignment to pass the course. 

She shows up exactly on time or 2-3 minutes late for class. Their syllabus states that they must be on time for the clinical portion of class (that I teach) or they will be sent home and their absence unexcused. I have not kicked her out when she’s been 2-3 minutes late because it just seems petty. She has also missed a couple of classes that had to be made up with other clinical experiences to get her required hours. I’ve discussed this with her course professor and also with the student in her midterm evaluation. 

She missed her second to last clinical and I reminded her that she would have to complete that final assignment at her last clinical to pass. She assured me she would. I had a conversation with her classroom professor who has also been frustrated with the student this term. She had just finally turned in an assignment that was 3 weeks late. I was annoyed by that because she ended up getting the same grade as students who completed it on time. Next semester the syllabus will specify points lost for late assignments. This hasn’t historically been an issue. 

Her course professor had a conversation with her in class last week about her final clinical and that assignment absolutely having to pass or she fails the course. On the last day of clinical, all the students were there, dressed in scrubs, ready for patient rounds, on time. Except this student who walked in 3 minutes late and not dressed. I said “You are late and you are not ready. This is unprofessional. You need to leave immediately.” 

So, my making her leave means she fails the course because there is no other chance to make it up and it’s final exam week. It also means it delays her graduation by at least one semester because she will have to retake that course and can’t take a course next term that needs this one as a pre-req. At the time I felt very justified in sending her home. She’s been given several warnings and multiple breaks with late work. But now I’m feeling kind of like I might have been an asshole in kicking her out knowing it guaranteed her course failure when I’ve let her stay when she was late in the past. What do you think, Reddit?

EDIT:
I’ve had a few comments where I’ve addressed this and it should probably be added to the original post. 

I did discuss her tardiness with her several times. At the beginning of the term she was 2-3 minutes late every day. At first I said “Be careful of your time!” Then a more stern “We start on time, you need to be dressed and ready to go by the start of clinical.” But I was trying not to be a total hard ass over 2 minutes. At midterm I had to do a written evaluation of each student. I put on there that she was often tardy and needed to be on time. Those go in her file. I also filed an Academic Improvement Plan which discussed her tardiness to clinical and those failed assignments. The AIP outlines future expectations which included being on time and turning in assignments. The AIP stays in her file and goes to her academic advisor. At that time I told her she had to be on time and ready for clinical, or the next tine she would be sent home.

EDIT 2:
Holy cow, I shut my phone off for a couple of hours to go see a movie and this is exploding!! I’m trying really hard to catch up on reading everyone’s comments and answer questions. Bear with me if you posted a question, I’m trying to weave me way through this thread. 

I’ve seen a few comments and gotten a bunch of dm’s calling me a misogynistic pig. I’m a female. This student being a female had zero to do with my decision. Last term I had a male student who behaved similarly and nearly failed, but finally got his shit together and showed up on time. I don’t care what their gender is, just do your freaking work. 

And for the people saying I’m TA because why does 2-3 minutes make a difference? You clearly have no idea what rounds are like in a hospital. At the time it begins you have doctors, nurses, residents, students, possibly case managers, social workers, etc, who assemble in a group to present each patient’s case. Every one of them is ready to go. At our hospital, an overhead announcement is made 10 minutes before rounds start so that everyone gets their shit together and is ready. I’ve told my students it’s best to arrive about 10-15 min early so they can be changed in hospital scrubs and in the group ready to go. Nobody is waiting 2-3 minutes for a student to catch up. And you can be damn sure nobody is waiting 10 minutes for a student who came in late and wasn’t dressed.

FINAL EDIT: Wow, I really didn’t expect this to garner so many comments! I tried really hard to read all of them and answer the ones asking for more info. I thought it would be easiest to update the most frequently asked questions here. 

Yes, I did attempt to find out what was going on in her personal life. I’m not an ogre. I wanted to help her and would have been willing to help her in any way I could if she’d given me anything I could work with. Her tardiness was typically the result of staying out too late and sleeping as late as possible. The incomplete and late assignments were the result of failing another course and focusing more on bringing her grade up there. So I tried being flexible on both to keep her sane, which evidently was not what I should have done. 

She did not fail because she was late for class. She had a required assignment 3 months ago that she failed. She put the redo off for 3 months. The day before her final clinical practicum she was advised that it was her last chance to complete it and that she had to be on time and prepared because she was on a final written warning for tardiness. Her failing grade comes from not completing a required assignment. 

I do not know if she has ADHD. I will keep that in mind in the future if I see this again. 

I have requested that the course professor edit the syllabus next term to include a clause for late assignments. It’s not my syllabus to write. I don’t teach in the classroom. 

Due to a lot of comments I’ve read, I now realize that I need to be more of a hard ass in enforcing attendance rules and wasn’t doing anyone any favors trying to be lenient. So, in the future I will allow the one tardy with a warning. Second time I will send them home. 

Thank you everyone for your feedback! I really was conflicted over it. I felt like since I have her a final written warning saying her next tardy resulted in her being sent home, she needed to be sent home. I just struggled a bit because of it being her last chance to complete her assignment. But you’ve all made me realize that it was her choice and she was aware of those consequences. I appreciate all of your comments, no matter how you voted. It helped me to look deeper at what I was doing and what I will do in the future.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my bf to move in with me?,"UPDATE: 
Firstly, thank you everyone for your incredibly kind words and messages. 

Secondly to clarify a couple of things, I never gave him express permission to move in end of july. I had said that I would be excited for him to move in eventually back in May when he first brought it up but that i thought it was too soon, and as he spent more time here over may/june I realised i wasnt happy with how he treated my home as a guest, let alone as a roommate. After my initial excitement I was careful to rebut his suggestion to move in whenever he brought it up because of this. 

We have now broken up. His mum came round to my condo the other night and basically demanded that I give her a new set of keys(I changed the locks after I told him to get his stuff because he refused to give me his set back). When I refused she made up a bullshit story about how he had left something here and i stupidly let her into my condo. She then went on to ""accidentally"" knock over a vase of flowers, stand on Tiffany, and stood in my lounge/kitchen and called her son telling him to come round asap whilst refusing to leave. I called the cops who arrived shortly before my ex did and escorted her away. I then broke up with my ex through the door because I didn't want to risk letting him into my apartment. 

Yes there were a lot of red flags but my prior relationship was not a great one at all(can't say why the post will get banned) and I didn't have any other experience  with relationships, so I came into this one with a kinda skewed idea of what was expected in a relationship and just didn't see them until I reread my post from an outsider perspective. 

For everyone asking, Tiffany(my cat) is fine. She was a rescue, she was a persian/rag doll/unknown cross that was born to a kitten farm and had 4 litters by the time she was two which is when she was uplifted and my mum got her for me. Ive had her for almost 10 years now and shes an absolute princess.

So i like my bf but I dont know if this is the right timing for us. We've been together for about 10 months and he has recently started asking to move in with me. 

My initial reaction was happiness, I was excited to spend more time with him but as he's been staying with me more(3-4 nights per week) there's a few things that have been bothering me. 

1. My bf tends to just drop stuff and not pick it up, I have a small condo so piles of clothes and stuff tend to be quite noticeable when there's basically only a handful of surfaces. I have asked him to pick stuff up and he just shrugs it off. 

2. He stays up late gaming and refuses to wear headphones so it keeps me up at night(once again its a small condo so hard to get away from noise). He works from 12pm-9pm(4 days a week) so feels like he should be able to enjoy his evenings, but i work from 6am-4pm(5 days a week) and I drive heavy machinery so its important I get enough sleep and im alert enough for work.

3. He recently was telling me about how much he was going to save by not paying rent(he currently pays $210/wk), and I questioned why he thought he would be living rent free with me, he argued that he shouldn't have to contribute to my mortgage, and I agreed but said that I would still want about 50% of market rent(market rent is around $220 and i said i would like $100/week, my mortgage payments are $340/week so its not like he's paying half my mortgage). This turned into a rather large argument and he repeatedly slammed doors in my condo and damaged the lock on one. He then got mad when I asked him to help fix it.

4. He has repeatedly suggested that if he moved in then my cat would have to be confined to the hall cupboard when he's here because he doesn't like cats(he's not allergic, he just doesn't like them). I disagree and think that's unfair to my 11yo cat who has had the run of the place for the last 4 years.

Long story short, my bfs current rental period is up end of July and he has repeatedly talked about moving here rather than finding somewhere else, ive consistently rebutted this but finally put my foot down last weekend after he deliberately let my cat outside and said he absolutely wouldn't be moving in with me and I wanted him to move his gaming stuff out if my lounge/kitchen area. He threw a massive fit and stormed off and now his mum is ringing me and calling me a lot of rather rude things because he's going to have to move back in with them until he finds a new place. AITA for mot letting him move in, even though I was initially keen?

AITA for walking out of a job interview?,"Around this time last year, I was in the job hunt and was looking at tech sales positions in my area. I’d been in this career about ten years, and had been recently laid off.

I was granted an interview at a relatively large startup downtown, and after the initial phone screen, I did my research and went on site for my in-person interview.

Admittedly, I got there about 25 minutes early, which was pushing obnoxious, but nobody was at the front desk. So I signed in using the iPad, took a seat, and waited. I waited until the time of the interview, got up, looked around, and started trying to get the attention of people walking around, as nobody had acknowledged me to this point.

At 15 minutes past the interview scheduled time, a lady came into the lobby and asked what I was there for. I let her know I had an interview scheduled for 15 minutes ago. She asked me to hold on and went back into the office, and a few minutes later, came back with an agenda with materials laid out about the company. The agenda confirmed that were were supposed to have already started, and that I had two interviewers in the next two 30-minute blocks.

A new person came over and sat me in a room and told me to read over the materials to get familiar. I did this for 45 minutes, and when the VP of sales didn’t show up to interview me, I got pissed, stood up, and left. I found my way to the front desk and told the person who was not there before and had likely no idea who I was that I was ending my interview, and to have a great day.

About 15 minutes later, I got a frantic call from the recruiter saying the VP was looking for me and that they wanted to start my interview. I answered that if they weren’t willing to respect my time, then I knew all I needed to know about what working there would be like.

I told several folks this story, and it’s been a 50/50 on whether or not I did the right thing, or that I don’t know the circumstances and that I could have stuck around and at least interviewed and let them know later on. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA For Refusing To Support My Wife Through Her Diagnosis After Her Infidelity,"My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

She recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

We talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

Before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.

They (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?

**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. To the mods, I'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. I'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",Not the A-hole
AITA for confronting my SIL for wearing clothes that belonged to me?,"Some info: A few years ago, my family didn’t have a lot of spare money to buy a lot of things (lower middle class), only recently (around 2016) did my husband get a new job and we got financially better by a lot, so finally we could afford to buy things for our kids and travel.

In 2018, I was so excited when my husband got both of us tickets to go to India for 2 weeks and gave me 200,000 rupees for punjabi suit shopping (traditional indian clothes). This meant a lot to me because my husband is a nice man but he’s very quiet and not very romantic, so this gesture meant a lot to me because he knew how badly I wanted to go to India.

We went to India, got beautiful suits (I also bought a few for my kids and SILs) and was so happy. I had never gone on a shopping spree like that before in my 45 years of living.

When we reached our home country, my husband surprised me with a gift. It was this beautiful lengha that costed 30,000 rupees, that he had secretly purchased for me. He said to keep it and wear it on our 25th wedding anniversary celebration.

Fast forward to our 25th anniversary (8 months ago), my daughter and I are rummaging through all my clothes and I cannot find this lengha at all. We searched for DAYS and could not find it. We barely have any friends come over as we usually just go out with them, so mostly only my husband’s family visited my home (my family lives in a different state).

I explained this to my husband and he was very upset. I was crushed. I know it might sound stupid to be upset over a piece of clothing, but for a couple that barely did anything romantic, this meant a lot to me.

About a week ago, my daughter comes running out of her room and shows me a picture of my SIL wearing the EXACT same lengha as the one my husband bought. I asked her how she found the photo and she explained that she was on Instagram and she saw that her cousin was at a small get together (covid restrictions allow up to 30 people to attend a party) and saw her aunt in the background wearing the exact same lengha so she took a screenshot. I was livid but I didn’t want to jump to any conclusions.

So I waited for a few days to calm down and proceeded to call my SIL. I explained everything. And she was SILENT. After I finished, the only thing she said was “I saw it last year and just borrowed it. You have so many suits, I don’t know why you are so angry I took one.” I was pissed because she took it without permission, feigned innocence when I asked her about it last year and is now claiming that I’m overreacting. I lost it and just gave her a piece of my mind for 20 minutes. She straight hanged up when I was done. Now my mother in law and my other SILs are calling me an asshole for scolding her and they’re forcing me to apologise to her and just let her keep the lengha. So AITA?

TLDR: husband bought me a lengha for 25th anniversary, it went missing, asked my fam & they said they didnt know anything, then saw my SIL wearing it at a party.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?","I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. 

Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

But the part where she says she’s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she’ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",Asshole
AITA for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?,"My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

Since then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:

1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. While playing one of his games, I told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him ""You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" He has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.

After his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.

His mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

"AITA for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?","Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

She came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

For her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.

Lunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. 

So I explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

I called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""No"" and ""This really shouldn't be a big deal.""

This might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. 

Just to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""Are the other kids making fun of you?"" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. 

So AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?",Not the A-hole
AITA for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my GF wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?,"To preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

Little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

I occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition I've had since i was born. over the last year or so my GF(R) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

For the Issue at hand. R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

Edit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

I've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making my pregnant SIL sleep on an air mattress?,"My partner and I bought a house this summer, and for Thanksgiving we’re hosting my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law (SIL), and her husband. SIL is due with her first baby at the end of February.

The plan is to have parents (in their late 60’s) sleep in our guest bedroom on a proper frame and mattress. That leaves our office, with an air mattress (a decent one, but still) for SIL and her husband. 

Last time SIL visited overnight a few months ago, we had other guests already staying in the guest bedroom for several weeks and felt it would be a lot to have them move all their personal items, so we gave her the air mattress again.  She made a big deal about how pregnant people should get priority sleeping arrangements, even if it means uprooting someone for a night. She recently mentioned to my partner that maybe she and her husband should take our master bedroom when they come in a few days for the holiday.

I’ve never been pregnant, and I can respect that maybe you just want some damn comfort as you grow a human. However, I think my judgment may be clouded by my annoyance that she historically makes a stink about getting what she wants, pregnant or not. Further, I currently live long-distance from my partner, and I am only home for the week. I just want to enjoy the visit, appreciate the home we’ve bought AND sleep in my master bedroom, dammit. AITA?

EDIT: Thanks for all of your suggestions and reality checks. I really liked the suggestion from /u/lizard_windowpane to leave it to the in-laws in a group chat to determine who sleeps where. Realistically, it feels a bit late in the game to insinuate via text that SIL would be better off not showing up, so my partner and I have decided to put our nice comfy mattress into the office for SIL and rock out on the air mattress in our room for the visit. Is it a perfect solution? No, but SIL and elder in-laws get much-needed comfort, we keep our room. Hopefully next year, we’ll just be guests!",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I didn’t give up MY honey moon villa to my grandparents?,"My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.

My husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our “real” one. 
We were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.

The bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

Our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

We have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

Well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to “slave” and live as “peasants” while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

This is bora bora we’re talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. 

There was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would’ve been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would’ve given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn’t. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

I obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn’t one just sit back and be grateful they’re on a free vacation instead of complaining?

My grandparents freaked out. Saying I’m holding money above their head and that I’m being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

Idk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it’s falling apart. 

I don’t think I’m the asshole at all, but I’ve been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

So Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?



***UPDATE***
Even though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it’d be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.

During breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we’re not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

I made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn’t looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

They kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

Well, I’m not doing that. 
I’ll pay for their flight back home, but I’ve already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. 

So there you have it. My grandparents weren’t even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. 

After breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn’t get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

Staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn’t care less my grandparents are gone, in their words “they kill the vibe”. So everyone’s happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

I’m happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

I have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can’t get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is. 

I did not go the usual Asian route. I actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. My dad is also an entrepreneur, I looked up to him and am so glad I had him as an inspiration who paved the way. Don’t give up on your dreams.",Not the A-hole
AITAH for letting my coworkers quit because I got fired?,"A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.

My manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it’s a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

There is no way to prove there wasn’t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn’t put liquor in that shot.

I honestly don’t and didn’t care enough to argue with her about it. I’m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

I trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don’t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I’m going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

I then let my anger overtake me and I said “if you want to find a job where you don’t have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You’re all capable people that don’t deserve a psycho watching over you when you’ve put good time into a work place.” I basically contradicted myself. 

I feel like I went over the top, my sister said I should’ve kept my mouth shut. But I explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the “mix things together to look like booze so people don’t feel rejected when they buy you shots trick”. She thinks it’s crazy the new manager won’t trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

My old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiancé, but she told the new manager that I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering I was basically running the bar when she came in. 

Whatever the case, AITAH for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don’t want the bar to close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up...",Not the A-hole
AITA for hiding my finances from future MIL,"I recently got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years. For background, he’s an oncologist, his parents divorced when he was 5, MIL never remarried or had more kids but FIL did and so Fiancé has a younger half-brother and a step mom. 

I have a BA and MBA from decent schools, but I quit my conventional office job to be a yoga teacher and eventually opened my own yoga studio.  MIL was not outwardly hostile towards me, more like polite but very cold. She told Fiancé it was because a yoga teacher wasn’t good enough for him. Why couldn’t he find a nice “lady doctor” or nurse at work, etc. Fiancé told me this because we don’t keep secrets but I never mentioned it to MIL, I just stopped trying so hard. She would periodically warn fiancé I was out for his money, because he’s a doctor, he needs someone “on the same level.” 

What MIL did not learn until after we were engaged is that, through my grandfather, I have a substantial trust fund. I have zero student loans, a paid off home, car, and own my studio with no debt. I keep this information private from most people because I don’t want to be judged for it. I didn’t tell fiancé until about 15 months into our relationship. 

When we got engaged she was telling fiancé he needs a pre-nup and that’s when he told her about my finances. She lost her mind. Told him he and I should not have withheld that information, we were disrespectful, deceitful, manipulative, etc. She then started trying to act like my best friend. I maintained a polite distance. 

She asked fiancé why and he told her that I knew he didn’t like me because a “yoga teacher isn’t good enough.” Y’all, she turned on the waterworks, tears, sobs, said he should not have told me and that he ruined her relationship with her future DIL. 

I think she’s full of it. His father and step-mom have been kind, accepting, warm and loving to me since the day we met. It didn’t matter that I’m just a yoga teacher. His mother insists I and my fiancé are cruel and deceitful. I think people like her are the reason I am right to hide my financial situation. Fiancé thinks we should apologize just to smooth things over and clean the slate. I have no interest in doing so. AITA?

Edit: For those asking - My Fiancé would defend me when she insulted me. She did know I owned the studio but assumed that I financed with loans. He did not have my explicit permission to share my finances with her but was so sick of her harping about a pre-nup he “wanted to shut her up.” As for all the advice about the pre-nup - that was always the plan, which my fiancé is obviously fine with. She’s probably going to lose her mind. I’ve poked around on JNMIL and I think my fiancé is what is people refer to as a “surrogate spouse” to his mother. Another incident comes to mind where she started crying when he wanted to spend his birthday dinner on the day of his birthday with me instead of her and offered her the day before or after. That’s clearly not healthy.",Not the A-hole
AITA for taking back my doll house that my sister’s kids have started to destroy,"When I was a child my dad built me a dollhouse. It was lovely. He worked so hard on it, everything was so detailed, down to the tooth brushes, light switches, etc. imo, it’s a piece of art. I took care of it very well and he even installed a sliding plastic door with a lock on it so I could protect it from my more destructive little sister.


I moved out and the doll house stayed at my mom’s. Now my mom has grandkids(my sister’s kids) and they have destroyed it. A bunch of pieces are missing, the lights have been torn out, the carpet and curtains have been torn up, the chimney is broken, etc. When I saw it I was hurt at how destroyed this incredible gift from my now deceased father was.


So I decided to take it back to my house to fix it and keep it safe. My sister noticed when she took the kids to my Mom’s and it was gone so she asked me about it. 


She asked if she could have it or at least bring it back to mom’s bc her kids play with it. 

I didn’t want to start a big uproar so I tried to kindly explain that I wanted to keep it preserved how dad made it. I told her the kids can play with it when they are at my house but they needed to get better about taking care of it and not messing everything up. 


She got really mad and said “omg it’s a fucking dollhouse. It’s supposed to be played with. I’m not bringing my kids over so you can critique their playtime”

AITA for not letting my sister and bil sleep in my room instead of the living room?,"
My sister, bil, and their son moved in with me for due to financial issues. They have been here for around a month now.

I only have a two bedroom place though. So my sister and bil have been bunking down in our living room and their son is staying in my sons room.

They’ve asked if we could change the sleeping arrangements, so they (sister and bil) get one of the bedrooms and the boys stay in the living room. She said she and her husband were having problems because they never have any privacy for just the two of them.
 
I said no to that because my son (who is autistic) needs to keep his sleeping arrangements and space the same otherwise he will have a meltdown and I’ll have a hard time getting him to bed. 

 My sister understood that and then asked if I could stay in the living room then. She thinks it makes more sense for the single person to sleep in the living room instead of the couple who could share a bed. And yeah, from a neutral point of view it makes more sense, but come one this is my home. I want to keep my private area to myself in my home. It’s already driving me crazy having them here all the time. It’s only going to be worse if I don’t have someplace to retreat to. 

I also don’t want to have to sleep on a couch or air mattress in my home. I want to sleep in my bed where I won’t wake up with a backache.

Also let’s be real I don’t want my sister having sex in my bed. If I had a guest room I wouldn’t care, but them being in my own personal bed just makes me uncomfortable. Like I totally get that not having privacy and not being able to have sex sucks for them, but I don’t think that that should effect me.

So, I told her no to that too and now my sister and bil are basically giving me the silent treatment. They’re also both getting snippy with each other and arguing in hushed tones.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my future father in law I’m a different race every time he asks?,"I am marrying into my fiancés white family next summer, and I have been with him for almost 4 years now, and I met his family very early on, less than a year in. I am Latina, but third generation, but I guess I must look very racially ambiguous because I get a lot of questions and guesses. That being said, my fiancé’s dad KNOWS I’m Latina. He’s met my parents, and he’s asked before. 

Ever since we announced our engagement, his moms been very involved in planning so we’re around his parents a lot more often. FIL has asked NUMEROUS times “what are you again?” Or “you’re (insert random race of brown people) right?” And other variations. At first I didn’t think much of it but it happens SO often that I can’t help but think it’s on purpose. My fiancé and his mom seem to not think much of it, or they’ll just laugh it off as if he’s joking or implying it’s funny that he’s “forgotten” again. This seriously happens like once a week I wanna say. 

So, I’ve just started “joking” back and either confirming I’m whatever he thinks I am that day, or I just tell him something random. My fiancé thought it was funny at first but has now changed his mind and thinks I’m being disrespectful. I think it’s his dad being disrespectful, and I’m dealing with it in a funny lighthearted way. AITA

EDIT: I meant ethnicity not race! Sorry!

ANOTHER EDIT: guys... it’s okay! I think this has gotten out of hand. My future FIL is being annoying at worst, it might have racial undertones but he’s a normal decent guy who treats me well outside of all this, not some sort of hateful racist monster. I assumed the fact that I’m able to joke back to him about it implied that this is honestly all in good fun, just because it has some serious undertones doesn’t mean it’s some sort of relationship ending catastrophe. If it helps, imagine he was calling me by the wrong name and I gave him a fake one each time. It’s not as racially charged, but it’s honestly about the same energy behind it if that makes sense. I’m engaging in this discussion and getting into the racial implications because I genuinely find it interesting and fun, but it really doesn’t have to be as serious as it’s gotten.

"AITA for leaving my mom, her bf and 3 sisters?","I recently left the house a few days ago. I was woken up at 1 p.m. with a hit on my head by my 1 year old sister and her plastic toy. I had just stayed up until 4 a.m. feeding my newborn sister because my mom couldn't. My mom just had a c-section so she couldn't move or walk for a long time so she is often on a chair. A few hours later, she and I were arguing about groceries (she spent $300 on JUST meat 2 weeks ago, so the previous week, I spent $100 on snacks and household essentials like soap/shampoo and laundry detergent, she wanted me to list everything I bought and was yelling at me when I couldn't remember) and I went to my room in the middle of the argument because I was sick of the fighting. She told me to come downstairs and continued yelling stuff like ""don't make me go up there!"" And I knew she couldn't so I just stayed in my room crying. My dad called me and I explained the situation to him, he said if I didn't like her rules, then leave. Then my 16 y/o sister texted me ""mom said to leave the house"", so I packed. A friend picked me up and I walked out with necessities, and as I walked out, my mom said ""never come back"". My friend dropped me off to my best friends house and at that point, I had cried for like 3 hours straight. That was all 3 days ago.

2 days ago, my 16 y/o sister (who is pregnant and almost due) texted me that I needed to come home to watch my 1 y/o and newborn sisters for 2 hours so that she can go grocery shopping with my mom's boyfriend (1 y/o and newborn's dad, who is just recently unemployed but he's a nice guy) and I told her I wasn't coming back because my mom told me not to. My 1 y/o sister had choked on her food yesterday because I didn't go home to watch her while my mom was with the newborn, then my dad told me to drop my pride and go home just because she's my mom. This has nothing to do with pride, both my mom and dad told me to leave the house knowing she needed me. My parents had always told us kids that if we don't like living under their roof, then leave; we didn't have a reason and were too scared to do it. They must've been shocked when the only child of theirs who grew up without causing any trouble in school, or getting knocked up, or getting bad grades, and always helping them and putting up with their toxic ways, left. I want to help but my mom is very lazy, I often have to do everything around the house while watching my sisters. I'm only 18, my mom won't even take me to the DMV for my permit or license, even though she did it for my brother (the eldest child, he's living with my dad). I'm under constant stress because of my mom and nothing ever satisfies her. I am currently staying at my best friend's house and with my new free time, I can finally go around and apply for jobs and make something of myself. I feel sad but I've been resenting my mom for a few years now, but I always needed to obey her just because she was simply my mom and I couldn't take it anymore.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?,"My wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. All they do is text each other occasionally, which I have no problem with. I explained to her early on that I am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. She agreed and it was never an issue until now.

Her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and I to meet. Once again I explained to her that I have zero interest in such a meeting. I see no point to it, I don't need his blessing or approval, and I have enough friends. Plus the whole idea just seems awkward. 

She explained that it would mean a lot to her if I would just meet with him. I asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. I snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""Since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* 

She didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. I know my answer is not going to change and I am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. AITA? Also any advice is much appreciated.

Thank you.

**P.S**

I don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but I think I'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. I love my wife but I don't think I have her heart. He was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.

**EDIT**

With regards to divorcing her over this:

> I'd rather divorce her than control her. I didn't tell her that I would do this, it will simply happen. I can control what I do (not meeting him), but I cannot control what she does. It would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp.",Not the A-hole
AITA for buying the dress that my friend wanted but couldn’t get because they don’t have it in plus size?,"I and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend’s wedding, and for the past few weeks we’ve been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. My friend Ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said “I love this but they don’t have it in my size.” (She is US 14.)

I agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group’s conversation moved along. 

Yesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn’t think too much about it because it’s not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.

A few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn’t buy it because it wasn’t available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I’m trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I’m skinnier. 

To be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn’t intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn’t answered my calls or messages. 

So I just want to know: AITA for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress Ana liked but couldn’t buy because they didn’t have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",Not the A-hole
AITA from bailing on my promise to sew my future SIL wedding dress?,"TL: DR: I had agreed to sew on my SIL wedding dress, she changed the model she wanted for something far more complicated and expensive, I bailed out, now my family think I'm heartless.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: I am really touched by the support and the many great advices I received.Many of you here or on pm gave me ideas and leads on how to deal with this the best way available, as well as pointing out things I hadn't even considered.  


\* On saturday I see my parents. I will explain to them that as much as I appreciate their faith in my capacities, I am not up to the task, and while their support is amazing, at this moment and on that's subject, it's misguided.  


\* I will do an itemized list of the costs of the first dress (the one I agreed to make), a quote from a professionnal seamstress of my town for the new dress my SIL want, and a few picked up exemple of the prices of off the rack dresses and show it to them to demonstrate my point  


\* Many of you also pointed out that while my SIL is planning on splurging... the question of who is going to shoulder the extra cost hasn't been raised. I want to touch that point with them too.  


\* Also raise the point that it's all nice and well to ""faire des plans sur la comète"" ( I think in english it can be translated as wishing upon the moon) for a 2021 wedding, it's not even guaranteed! Yes, having her wedding ruined is hard and shitty and effed up, and to all of you here going through this, I really hope the postponement will only bring you even better things. But, it doesn't allow her to act like this, and I Will not go to that wedding unless big apologies are made.

Last but not least. i had no idea there were that much fabric artists, may you all be sewists, embroidresses, stylists, and such. And I had no idea this community would be so supportive and I also learned a lotSo, again, thank you all. I will update next week when I have seen my parents

My brother and future SIL had planned on getting married by the end of june, but Covid happened.

Long before that, he had requested from me, as a wedding gift, to sew the wedding dress of my SIL: I am by no means a professionnal but I can do simple stuff rather nicely. I already sew stuff for my family and friends as gifts regularly, little outfits for the kids or cosplays, easy stuff that can be worn even if there are a few defects on it... They had planned on a no frill wedding with close family and friends only, and my SIL had her eyes on a flowing, layered grecian tunic style dress: rather easy to do and not too expensive as far as materials needed so I agreed.

But with the lockdown, well, things got complicated (lockdown started here on march, so we were unable to get the fittings down, eg) and pretty soon they realised the wedding would have to be postponed.

My SIL LOST it. Really. Crying and screaming and everything, nothing we could do or say could calm her down, until my brother asked her what she wanted to do instead and she said she wanted now a big wedding as a compensation. I mean, well, ok, I get her frustration, I really do. But the main reason they were having a small wedding was to save on some bucks to renovate the house and such. But that's none of my business, I know.

My brother relented and they are now planning a big thing for 2021.

SIL sent me her new requirements. She wants a full skirt, silk, bodiced, lined, embroidered, train-ed, the whole princess gig, dress. That, of course, I would still pay for in full for the materials.

I told her I didn't feel I could do it. That it was too complicated for my skills. She went ballistic. Said I was lying, that I had done complicated things before, and that it was just "" nothing more than a couple more stitches"".

I have been trying to explain to my brother (because she doesn't want to speak to me anymore, as I am conspiring to ruin her wedding) that I do not feel able to do it. His solution is that I buy the wedding dress she wants, or I wouldn't be invited to the wedding.

So I said ok. I said I wouldn't go, because I couldn't do what they asked me. I can't sew that dress, and I certainly can not pay for what she wants.

I'm now the heartless big sis who doesn't approve of her lil bro wedding/ wife, and honestly I just want to tell them all to go stitch their too big mouths closed!

AITA for ruining my brother in law's day with a purposeful fart?,"BIL and husband co own a house that was passed to them by their father. We live in one half while BIL lives in the other. The only thing we share is the living room and kitchen, the rest is completely separate. 

Lately BIL has been making odd comments about my ladylikeness. I am a down home back woods dirt under my fingernails still play in mud puddles basically wood rat of a woman. He's been cutting into hard labour chores I do and tells me he'll do it so I don't hurt myself/get dirty. He'll make positive comments when he sees me cleaning (lucky man!) and says things like ""I've never seen you cook! You should cook more!"" Note, he does not cook either. I like to look nice here and there. Whenever I do dress up and do makeup, BIL makes comments about how I should do it more often and I look super nice. He has said ""dressing up for husband?"" 

All of these I shut down with ""I do it when I feel like it,"" ""I'm doing it for me,"" etc. 

He is not a bad dude overall, hes actually a riot to hang out with, but it's little subtle things spread out and it digs at me as roommates do. Luckily we're moving soon. 

Anyways, yesterday I belched in the kitchen because I thought no one was around. BIL pops his head in and jokes ""have you ever thought about being more ladylike?"" Now the tone is joking but the word  ""ladylike"" is like my emotional tailgating car. Tailgating only makes the person in front slow down. Telling me to be ladylike makes me turn that shit way down. I have mad props to graceful and more traditional ladies if they like it, but I am not one! I say ""nope!"" and he replies ""you should consider it"" and leaves the room. 

So this morning, I'm walking by the living room, BIL is watching the morning news, and I decide to grace the room with a big long fart. This is the just woke up and shit is moving fart. It is the fart that has been building all night. It is loud, it has vibration, and even in the tiny room it echoes. I'd honestly give it a good 9/10 it was a damn masterpiece. 

I thought it was hilarious, immediately. BIL not so much. He proceeds to jump up and rage about how gross it was (fuck I've heard him blow out farts before) and how women shouldn't do that. Unfortunately by this time I am doubled over in tears because I can't stop remembering the fart and his rage has made it even funnier. He gets beyond mad and storms off to his bedroom. It's now 9pm and he is still enraged and hiding in his room. He says it was an asshole move (technically the truth?) 

At first husband thought it was funny too but now since it's upset his bro so bad he's leaning towards maybe it was too much and too immature and that I should have just told him that he was being overbearing. 

I feel like as a 37yo man, BIL should have known better than to think he can tell a grown woman how to behave. It probably would have been better to talk about it, but who pouts ALL DAY over a fart? 

So, am I the asshole for solving problems with an asshole?

Edit: you all are making me cry laughing again. I'm showing my husband and he's come around.

Edit 2: every single fart story is killing me, I feel a tenth of my age right now.

Edit 3: just woke up to this, combing through comments and loving it. BIL came to me when I went to go make coffee and said I made him feel uncomfortable in his own house. I told him it's my house too, and I've seen him do the same unashamedly. He made a couple ""but I'm a man"" comments and I called it out as sexist. He asked me how it was and I asked how it was NOT. After a few back and forths he started to understand that he is not my husband, this is my house too, and I do not and will not ever meet his southern standard for a woman. 

He wraps it up with ""... I guess it was kind of funny,"" and stalks off. I left a coffee peace offering in the living room, where he is enjoying saturday morning programming without a violent crop dust. We're all going to make dinner tonight and have a family make up with hopefully no dinnertable farts (I have SOME standards)

All in all, pretty damn good end result. And I bet I will never hear ""be ladylike"" from him again.

AITA if I talk to my 18 yo brother about age of consent against my mothers wishes?,"My brother is 18. He has a 15 year old girlfriend. Age of consent where he lives is 16. They are both in highschool, he is a senior, she is a junior.

To my knowledge, he is still a virgin. He does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and STD prevention. Another thing my mother and I butt heads about but she gave in on that one.

My mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. She said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. It wasn't necessary. I implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

Last night I called my brother and discussed it with him myself. I didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. He also told me they haven't done anything yet. I told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. I told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  I also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that I wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.

I tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. My mother is pissed that I talked to him about it when she told me no.

AITA For Taking Care of My Dad Financially Against My Wife's Wishes?,"I'm M35, my wife is f28, we've been married for 3 years now. My dad is 65 and retired now with a small but decent pension, my mom passed away when I was 10 and my dad never remarried and never had another relationship to my knowledge. He raised me and my sister by himself and worked 3 jobs for over 10 years to support my sister and I through university. My dad is the hardest working person I've ever known and heard of, he is my inspiration and my hero. He was born in a tin hut in rural Bangladesh and came to Canada with nothing and worked tirelessly everyday to help himself out. I am very successful and have been taking care of my dad since I graduated uni and I provide him with about $1,000 a month and my sister who's a social worker gives him about $300. His house is paid off and I paid for a full renovation to his place this year which my wife wasn't too happy about but his place needed major work. 

My wife came to me last week and suggested I stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal utilities, food, gas on a benz I bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff. I told her that I want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole life and the extra 1k I give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer suit, go on holidays etc. He also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and they're pretty happy so I'm extremely happy for my dad. The money helps with dates and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. My wife just basically put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't I pulled in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no kids and I own our condo we live in outright. She basically called me an asshole for guilting her into giving money to my dad and said he's a grown man and can figure things out himself.

AITA for forbidding my trans-sister-in-law from observing me giving birth,"Throwaway obviously, this is a pretty unique situation so I think my main account will get identified pretty fast otherwise. I'm 32/F/Florida.

So basically, I thought this was a pretty cut and dry situation, but apparently not, as I'm getting a lot of judgement (some bordering on abuse) from different people and my phone is blowing up. So I want to know if I was out of line.

So I'm 6 months pregnant, and I've been very open about what kind of way I want to give birth. I've discussed this with my group of girlfriends extensively, along with my family. I ideally want to have a natural, unassisted birth at home, which is near a hospital if things start to shape up as problematic. Now, for this process, I want support, and of course my husband is going to be there, but also I want my two sisters to be with me. 

This is where things get controversial. In my many conversations with friends and family, I mentioned I want my sisters there with me. I do not want my brother there, that would just be weird! But, in these conversations, my trans-sister-in-law was present, and she got the idea she would be included in this childbirth situation. Just for reference she transitioned around 3 years ago. I was unaware of this until last week, when she told me if there is anything in particular she should bring for the birth. I calmly mentioned that I am very selective over who I want in this very intimate situation, and told her than I hope she isn't offended if she isn't there for the birthing. 

This is when things blew up. She lost her temper and I got a torrent of emotional outbursts.  She said that she would never be able to give birth herself and excluding her is taking away from her womanhood and depriving her of her only chance of experiencing this expression of femininity. When she found out my two sisters were going to be there she told me that I was transphobic and she has as much of a right to be there as they do. 

After this, I received many emails, facebook messages, and text messages from several different people, calling me  transphobe and many other hurtful things. My trans-sister-in-law is very active in the transactivism community (which I fully support), and apparently she told them what had transpired. This has obviously rallied them to harass me, and now I'm starting to wonder if I messed up. 

I kind of wish I never mentioned anything about the birthing process to her, maybe I should have just kept all these plans to myself so she wouldn't feel excluded. I'm aware transpeople have a pretty shitty deal in life, and perhaps this added to their feelings of exclusion. But the other part of me says, it's my birthing, I'm going to very vulnerable and exposed, and I (perhaps selfishly) owe it to myself to make it as comfortable and safe for me as possible.

AITA for not letting my husband meet our first born child,"My husband has this best friend, Anna. They've been friends for a long time and dated years ago, mutually deciding that its best for them to remain friends. I've had no problem with this relationship until now. 

On the day that I gave birth, Anna's brother got into a car accident. My husband got a call from her in the middle of the night and asked him if he could drop her at the hospital her brother was at (an hour away from us) since she was too scared to drive. My husband agreed, told me quickly while I was half-asleep and rushed out. 

A few hours later, I had contractions and called my husband. He didn't pick up after multiple tries so I gave up and called my Dad, who drove me to the local hospital (12 minutes away). I was so scared of giving birth alone since I've had about 3 miscarriages and 1 stillborn. 

My husband promised me that no matter what, he'd be there for me. Guess what? He wasn't. We called multiple times while I was in labor and when he finally picked up my Dad's call when I was giving birth, saying that he'd misplaced his phone in the chaos, my Dad informed him that no matter how fast he drives anymore, he's going to miss the birth of his child. 

Well, my husband took that as ""he's already screwed up, so it doesn't matter when he shows up at this point"" so when he FINALLY came, our daughter was about 5 hours old and I'd already moved to the maternity ward. 

When he came, I refused to let him see our baby (edit: did let husband hold and play with baby after discharge) because I was so high on emotions and was shaking when I saw him and didn't want it negatively affect my time with the baby. I wanted her birth to be a happy time and I was already struggling to feed her. 

My husband was in a bad state and told me to please let him see her, so I told him to stand by the window and held the baby up so he could see her. I told him to then leave and he'll be allowed to interact with the baby at my father's home when we're both well and out of the hospital and that I was most likely divorcing him. 

He starting bawling and apologizing and defended himself by saying that Anna's brother was in serious critical condition and although he's fine, Anna needed him. Though Anna's parents were there, she's not that close with them and she was in an unbearable state. 

I told him that I didn't care and that his daughter has already come second to him and all she did was be born. I'm putting my daughter's and my health first and won't let her be sidelined. My husband agreed and left. However, Anna called me later and said that I was being controlling and she'd never met someone as cruel as me for not letting a father see his baby. I told her that my husband made his decision and that this was his doing not mine. 

But now, I can't help feel cruel in my actions and feel like I'm depriving my baby of both her parents being together. My husband sees her a few hours each day now. AITA?

Edit: I feel like this is useful information and could explain why I was so mad. 

Anna’s brother was not in a life/death situation. He had serious injuries, but most were concentrated on his legs and arm. He did have a concussion but gained consciousness soon. Anna was there along with both her parents who managed all the hospital stuff. My husband was there as a emotional support for Anna. 

I did let my husband see our baby, right after I got discharged (Edit: husband saw baby, husband held baby, husband played with baby). I wanted a couple days of rest and bonding with the baby since my emotions were so high and I was afraid if my husband was a continuous presence, I’d get stressed and something bad would happen. I told him as such. They spend time together, but I’m still cold with him. 

I may still be the asshole, I don’t know, but I’m still so mad at him and it’s not the first time he put Anna before me. I can forgive the other times since I could handle it but this time was the straw. I was so scared to hold my baby because I was paranoid the minute I touch her, something would happen to her and no one was there to comfort me. I only had my dad but he wasn’t in the delivery room which is why i’m not too keen on forgiving my husband.

Also, we both knew the baby was due anytime now so I don’t understand why my husband didn’t have his phone on him. We even tried reaching out to Anna and she didn’t pick up either.

After he learned I was giving birth, they already knew that Anna’s brother was going to be alright. He spent that time making sure that Anna was okay and feeding her and then waiting for the brother to regain consciousness. He could’ve come back after seeing his daughter to talk with the brother. He would’ve made it back in time.

Edit: So many of you got it wrong. I’m not preventing him from EVER seeing his baby, that is stupid and unreasonable. He literally saw her about a day later when we were discharged and safely at my dads home. He already didn’t see her for 5 hours on purpose and put Anna first, I didn’t think an additional day would make much of a difference. And it wasn’t to him, he was happy to see the baby and he spends time with her all the time. She’s two months now.

And also, I’m not mad about the fact he went to see Anna, I’m mad that he didn’t think we were a high priority to rush back to. He left me so quickly in the middle of the night when I was already late, he couldn’t have left Anna in the care of her parents and rushed as soon as possible? She’s not a child and she doesn’t have any mental health issues either.

Edit 3: So sorry for all the edits! But someone just messaged me this: What if my baby was born a stillborn again? He had no way to know since he and I didn’t have ANY contact after I gave birth. Thank the stars, my baby is healthy and well but it was a possibility.

Edit/Update: Thank you everyone for your replies. I think that I was an asshole for using my child against him and should have told him that he could hold and then asked him to leave. 

So the divorce is probably going to happen. My brother is looking at lawyers for me. 

In the midst of this whole mess, this post made me realize I never checked on Anna’s brother to see how he’s healing because I was so irked by Anna. I called him and he said that he was doing well and will be out of his wheelchair soon. He asked about me and the baby and how I was doing with the split and if I was okay with my husband and ... Anna. 

I can’t believe I was so oblivious. I thought they had an emotional thing going on because of this and when I confronted my husband, he denied it and said me and our baby were his priority and he made a “mistake” and he was being dumb. 

Yea no, Anna’s brother kindly informed me that he and Anna’s parents thought that my husband and I split when I was 7 months pregnant and that Anna and him were back on. He showed up at the hospital as Anna’s boyfriend which is why they didn’t bat an eye that he was there and not with his pregnant wife. Because apparently we split. Her brothers procedures were done well before the afternoon so I don’t know that my husband and Anna were doing for all those hours, but I don’t even wanna know. If you want more details, I can answer in a comment. 

Thanks everyone for your kind words and advice. I will be moving back home and filing for full custody. I don’t want my baby growing up to be like her father or Anna. He can be fun dad or whatever it is he wants to be.

AITA for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?,"I have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only I can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

Things worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

I came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. After this during the middle of the night I took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. It took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

Queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. Queue bitching. Queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". I don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. I'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when I regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think I'm an ass for good now and I had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

I have no regrets, and I don't think I'm an ass, but given I lurk this sub a lot I'm curious for your verdict in this matter. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how I act in my home?,"My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

Before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

Last week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, ""I fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, ""Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), ""This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

My spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home.",Not the A-hole
AITA for drinking alcohol at every family gathering and cryptically smiling when somebody suggested I do it because I can't handle hanging out with them?,"I'm a grown ass man, I'm 32, my family is huge and unbelievably annoying. I'm gay and that is the Voldemort of our family. Everyone knows about it, and most are afraid to acknowledge it. For that reason, everyone is fucking weird around me, they never know what to talk to me about, they're afraid of asking me anything so they don't really know much about me or my life, and they usually end up talking about the weather, themselves, or my seven million nieces and nephews.

Years ago I started dealing with the problem by coming to such gatherings as rarely as possible, and when I have to be there, I just get drunk. Not the lying-under-the-table-puking-in-Nana's-shoes plastered, but finding-everything-amusing drunk. I'm not normally a drinker, so it doesn't take me much to get to that stage.

However, recently, my brother made the observation that I drink every time he sees me. He sounded almost worried and asked if I drink every day, and I said no, not at all. Then he started laughing and said: what, you only drink when you see us? Huehuehue you couldn't handle being around us sober, huh? Huehue! 

And I just sort of smiled, and took a sip of my mulled wine and didn't respond.

20 minutes later, my mom comes up to me and says my brother's wife told her I only get drunk when I'm around them because I can't stand any of them. I ask her how my sister in law knows that, because I never said it. She goes away and comes back with my SIL who admits I never said it, but I never denied it either. They put me on the spot so I said it's not as bad as that, I just find it easier to socialize with so many people if I have 2-3 drinks.

My mom and SIL were like nooope, you hate us, admit you hate us, well fine, if you hate us, fine, don't come see us anymore, who cares, we don't care, you don't care, nobody cares and so on and so forth. It was just a vomit of passive aggression that I wasn't able to get a word in, so finally, when they asked me to leave, I did.

The only person who's contacted me since then is my brother, who laughed when he spoke to me on the phone and said ""they didn't mean it"" but admitted that he felt it was assholish of me to get drunk at every gathering. Honestly, the other option for me is to not go at all. I'm going because they like seeing me and being with me (despite not liking most things ABOUT me), so I feel like getting a little drunk is the less assholish route than not going at all.

**Edit: yall... I just logged in after a few hours of being away... to 500 comments. Sorry if I'm unable to respond to too many.**

Edit 2: Just to make it clear to the people who are under the impression my family isn't homophobic - just because I didn't list the shit they did to me or try to do to me, doesn't mean they aren't homophobic.

My parents have invited strangers to our house to talk to me when I was 17, to tell me I will never find happiness, truth or love as long as I am an immoral person, they outed me to the whole fucking town when they talked to the priest and he made me the topic of one of his Sunday services, which in turn resulted in every kid I went to school with to know I'm gay, bully me, beat the shit out of me.

They tried stopping me from going to university for fear it would exacerbate my gay feelings, they called me disgusting, an animal, an embarrassment, ""not my son"", my father demolished my room when I left for university and told me I wasn't welcome there anymore, I didn't speak to any of them for two years as a result of that and so on and so forth. Getting to where I am with my family now took a lot of hard hard work and ""getting over it"" and it's exhausting keeping it up, avoiding most topics about my life, not being able to be my authentic self.",Not the A-hole
AITA for exploding on my father's wife,"Throwaway  

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don’t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn’t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

AITA for not wanting to talk about my children that I lost in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami?,"In 2004, my family and I decided that over the Christmas period we’d go on vacation to Thailand. My husband had spent some time there as a child and really wanted to go back. I had two small children, a 4 year old girl and a 2 year old boy. We arrived on the 23rd of December and were due to go back on the 2nd of January. On the 26th, Boxing Day, a tsunami hit the resort we were staying in. I was upstairs in our hotel room when it hit, whilst my husband was with our children in the dining area. I prayed that my husband had our children whilst I fought for myself. 

My husband and I were reunited three days later, and he told me that the tsunami hit before he managed to grab our children. We stayed in Thailand for 4 months hoping our children were being kept somewhere with us presumed dead, but after searching pretty much everywhere, we presumed the worst and returned home which was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. 

I didn’t deal with the loss well, nor did my husband, and we ended up divorcing three years later. We couldn’t even look at pictures of the kids, and broke down just looking at each other. My family have always been as respectful as they can, apart from my mother. 

My mother and I have never had a good relationship. She was heavily addicted to drugs when I was born, and was in and out of my life until I was 15 when she sobered up. I was full of resentment and left the family home at 16 and we went about ten years without talking. 

Over the quarantine period, I have been staying with my sister and her family, and they also let my mom live with them. My mom will make dinners extremely uncomfortable for me by telling my nieces about the cousins they never got to meet, and how she felt when she found out, even though we weren’t talking at the time. 

Last night I finally snapped. We were sitting having dinner when my mom asked how my now ex husband is. I told her I don’t know, as I don’t, we haven’t spoken that often since we divorced. She asked if we’d still be together if the kids were alive, I asked how the fuck I was meant to know. She told me to stop being a bitch and I told her to stop bringing up my dead children. My nieces started getting upset because we were shouting, my sister told me to calm down as they’re all allowed to grieve too, which I completely disagree with. 

I left my sisters house and to a hotel not too far away because I seriously can’t take it anymore, but my sister has called multiple times telling me I’ve become a serious asshole since losing my children. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister's BF the truth?,"This past weekend, my sister and her bf came to a family cook out. He's in a field that interests me so we began talking, discussing work (medical) related tests, treatments, and drugs (He's a Pharmacist and I'm a Medical Lab Scientist). During this, he suddenly looks confused about something.

Sister's bf: You're oddly knowledgeable for someone who only went to community college.

Me: I didn't go to community college!

Sister's bf: (My sister's name) said that you did. Don't most technicians only need an Associates degree?

Me: Technicians yes, but I'm an MLS. I have two Bachelors and am working on a Masters.

Sister's bf: Then who went to community college?

Me: (My sister's name).

Sister's bf: She said that she went to (Name of good school) for Nursing!

Me: She did.

Sister's bf: Then why did she go to community college?

Me: Because she flunked out...

We continued talking and learned that my sister has told this guy a number of lies in the few months they've known each other. Things that my mother also confirmed were not true. He confronted my sister, more than a little disappointed.

My sister is now accusing me of trying to sabotage her relationship, something I think she did herself. I had no idea she was lying but most importantly, one look at her credentials and this guy would have known something wasn't right.

AITA for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request),"**Edit:** Well fuck me I just spoke with my maid. She says she hasn’t seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she’s never seen before. From her description I’ve never heard of him either. She kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

I guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. So before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. Honestly thought my marriage was perfect I never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

My wife and I have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. My wife is a stay at home mom while I work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

We live in Hong Kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. Our maid is a 34 year old Filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. She lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

The problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. She hasn't given any specific reason other than ""I don't want a maid anymore."" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:

- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

The woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

I'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

AITA for asking boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without me?,"Sadly this is a serious question.

In an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. 

I saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.

Reddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. 

AITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?

EDIT: He has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. I don't believe he has an active plan to cheat.

AITA for refusing to let my stepsister and niece move in with me or live in one of my other properties?,"When I was 8 my mom passed away and my dad remarried my stepmother when I was 11. My stepmother also had two children of her own Erica (11) and Becky (13). Growing up, Erica and Becky made it clear they didn’t consider me their sister and would continuously exclude me. They also recruited their cousins (from their mother’s side) and I was pretty much ostracized by them too so family events were horrible. 

Erica in particular really hated me and I still don’t know why. She would joke about my mom’s death, break my things (including a necklace that passed from my mom to me), would have massive tantrums when my maternal grandparents bought me anything so I was either forced to share or it was confiscated (note: my stepsisters were never expected to share gifts they got from their dad’s family), would “steal” my friends and boyfriends from me. 

When we were both 18, Erica ended up pregnant and decided to keep the baby. Our parents gave her both of our college funds to help her with the cost of having a baby since she didn’t work and the father wasn’t in the picture. I was devastated and pretty much gave up on the idea of college at this point. Thankfully, my maternal grandparents had been secretly building a separate college fund for me and I won some scholarships, so I was able to go to college with minimal debt.

My relationship with my dad has been strained ever since. So, when I got married, I had my maternal grandpa do all of the typical father-daughter stuff. 

My husband owned multiple properties before we got married and has a successful business. He helped me pay off my student debt and we’re doing very well financially. My parents recently got into some financial trouble and so have to downsize their house. They’re now demanding that I let Erica and her daughter move into either my house or one of my husband’s other properties. I flat out refused. Their argument is that my husband’s sister (who is also a single mother) lives in one of these properties rent free and that if we are willing to do it for her we should be able to help Erica too. They’re now calling me selfish for making a child homeless and that my husband’s money has made me a snob. Before this, Becky and I had started repairing our relationship and had actually grown closer but now she’s stopped talking to me and I’ve been shut out again. My stepmother’s family have also reached out to call me horrible names. 

The thing is, me and my husband could support Erica and her daughter, and I do feel like maybe I’m being petty for holding something she did to me when we were children against her. My niece is also the one who’s going to suffer if I don’t help. My husband says Erica is an asshole who never apologised so doesn’t deserve our help anyways, but he’ll help if it’s what I want.

AITA for giving my son a better life and spoiling him more than his siblings will ever get to be?,"brief back ground. about 9 and a half years ago my wife cheated on me, got pregnant, and left me for him. courts gave them custody of our son because single dad vs family. 

Ive since gotten remarried and had a couple kids(7 and 5 and a half), ex and her new man have also had 2 more kids.

Wife and I both work as engineers and have dang good salaries to put it lightly, ex and new husband havent ever done particularly well.  

Ex wife didnt want me sending my son ""lavish"" gifts or taking him on the family vacations so her other siblings wouldnt get too jealous and build resentment towards him(her words). Meanwhile he was understandably(I feel) upset he wasnt getting as nice a life as my other kids were as he got older. he asked to come live with me, I said yes id love to have him ex wife said no. thank God the courts sided with what my son wanted. Since moving in everythings gone fairly smoothly for us. my younger kids LOVE having their big brother around all the time, he loves them, we still go on our vacations every january(though had i known how bad rona was back then id have probably held off this year), for his 16th birthday he got a nice used buick he wanted. Since then shits hit the fan with his mom/my ex though. shes PISSED how much hes getting and getting to do, keeps texting and calling both of us about how his younger siblings will never be able to get all he has and its not fair and now her kids are upset and how im a horrible dad for forcing his siblings to resent him.

AITA for calling a pregnant woman a c***?,"I was at the bookstore the other day and as I approached the cash I saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

As I got closer I listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. She was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn’t available at the store. She was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn’t available. The girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and I could tell she felt bad. When the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a “inconsiderate little bitch”. As the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said “what’s the point of customer service if they won’t help you?” 
At this point, I had felt horrible for the young girl and I knew I had to say something. So I looked at the woman and I said “I just hope whatever you give birth to isn’t a total c*** like his mom”. The woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. I said I didn’t care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. She cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. He came in, didn’t say much (I’m 6’2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. As she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

Now, I still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that I was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. I felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. The cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. She thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so I think she’s ok. 

Ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

I still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying I was wrong in using the c word?

EDIT: a few people have mentioned that I should not have included the hijab comment. It was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, I meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn’t even have the chance to get a Kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. Sorry if it came across as pandering. Was not my intention.

AITA for telling my friend I didn’t appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband’s birthday party?,"My friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. The party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. We’ve been working on some remodeling projects, so we’ve been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

When we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

My friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

As the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend’s husband with the check. My friend’s husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, “I know this isn’t how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.” I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else’s eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.

I held my shit together because I didn’t want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn’t paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

I ended up messaging her and said, “Thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*’s party. We had a great time. Just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. We are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. Thanks again.”

My friend said, “Sorry! Should have given you a heads up. Glad you came.” And we haven’t spoken or hung out since. I’ve tried to set up coffee dates and girl’s nights but she just bails or never responds. It’s been almost 3 months, and she doesn’t seem to want to talk to me at all.",Not the A-hole
AITA for finally poking back at my childfree sister-in-law?,"My wife's sister Abby is ""childfree.""  Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.

We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.

There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.

She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.  And I just couldn't help myself and said something to the effect of ""for a person with such a fun childfree lifestyle you sure do have a lot of Netflix recommendations.""

Anyway: she's really mad at me now.  AITA?

**EDIT:** OK, despite the top comment, there were enough ESH judgments in here that I went ahead and called her to apologize for being a dick.  She accepted it and admitted that she'd been pretty rude to us herself.  I have a lot more sympathy for her after this conversation - I don't think I understood quite how aggressively my mother-in-law pushed on both her daughters to provide grandchildren, and it seems likely that Abby has lashed out at us as a poor substitute for the things she wants to say to her mom.

AITA for showering my niece?,"Obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. Also a heads up I personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what I actually did wrong. 

So last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. 

I thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?

ETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. 

1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.

3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

5. Thanks whoever gave me silver.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my daughter to marry her cousin?,"My daughter is planning on getting married very soon. However, I found out last week upon doing research on our family tree that my daughter's fiancé is her fifth cousin.

I initially didn't know how to break this news to her, but I finally did several days ago. My daughter apparently thought that this is perfectly fine, and that she's still going to marry him anyway.

I told her that I don't approve of this marriage, and that even though I initially agreed to pay for this wedding, I will not be paying for it if she decides to go through with it. We got into a huge fight, which ended with her telling me that she's cutting me out of her life.

AITA for laughing at my starstruck girlfriend?,"Last year, my (22m) girlfriend (23f) won a radio contests to briefly meet and take a photo with one of her favorite kpop groups, NCT. She was super excited since I guess you would call her a superfan. I definitely feel like she's too old to put so much stock in kpop, but I generally don't talk to her about it, since it's pretty harmless, just annoying.

She was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan.

She has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her ""idols"". I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them. What the fuck, was I supposed to talk to a bunch of Korean guys I don't know? We ended up arguing about it privately but it's been a sore spot and we just don't bring it up. She barely even listens to kpop around me now.

Fast forward to now, a year-ish later. My girlfriend just bought 2 NCT tickets for her and her friend, which were very expensive and include YET ANOTHER fan meet. I mention buying a ticket myself so I can go along with them (not to the fanmeet though) and my girlfriend said she'd rather me not go because she doesn't want me to be bored or embarrassed. The way she said it was so cold, for absolutely no reason, and I feel like she's being so passive aggressive over a joke that I made AGES ago.

AITA for making my husband choose between me and his son?,"I (39f) am married to Dave (44m), and he has a son named Avery (19m) and an ex wife named Dianna (42f.)  Avery has always been hostile towards me, and blamed me for his parents’ divorce, despite his dad not meeting me until three years after. I have tried my best to spend time with Avery, and I’ve been respectful of all the boundaries he set with me. Avery still hates me. It was fine with me, as long as he didn’t treat me like shit because he hates me.

Well, Avery started treating me like shit when he found out his dad was marrying me. He threw a fit, saying his dad needed his permission before marrying me, and that he wouldn’t come to the wedding. His dad and I let it slide, and sat down with Avery and Dianna to try and figure out why he was upset. It didn’t work, and Avery refused to see us until the wedding.

At Dave and I’s wedding, Avery objected to us being married in front of everyone, and asked to make a speech in front of everyone later in the night. In his ‘speech,’ he told everyone what a horrible person I was, and that I was responsible for his parents’ divorce, and that I was a dirty homewrecker. Dave drove Avery back to Dianna’s, but the damage was done, and several wedding guests assumed Avery was telling the truth. My wedding night was ruined because of this, and a good part of my family refuses to speak to me despite me explaining to them that this was not the case.

Avery has continued to treat me like shit since then. He got mad at me once, so he dropped my cat off at a shelter two towns over, and refused to tell me where he was until he’d been put down. I wanted to keep my wedding dress after the wedding, and he tore it to shreds. (Just two examples, I’ll give more if anyone wants them) 

Finally, Wednesday, Dave and I had Avery over for dinner because Avery actually wanted to come. Long story short, when I went to get dessert and Dave wasn’t there, Avery confronted me in the kitchen and began screaming at me and told me that I was a horrible person, as well as some other not-so-nice things. Dave eventually came in, Avery left, and I got pissed. I told Dave that I was tired of his son constantly attacking me and treating me like shit because of something he knows didn’t happen, and that I’d put up with his bullshit for the last six years. I told him that he had to make a choice between me and Avery, because I wasn’t putting up with Avery’s shit any longer, and if it was a requirement of being married to Dave, I’d be filing for divorce. Dave told me it wasn’t fair to make him make this decision, and I told him it might not have been fair, but it wasn’t fair of him to let his son harass and attack me for years.

AITA for making my husband choose between me and his son?

Edit 1: I’ve told Dave that I didn’t want to be around Avery several times, and got ignored. I was told that we’d go to therapy to try and sort things out and it never happened.

Edit 2: I don’t know why Avery blames me for the divorce. If your question is about that, I can’t answer you.

AITA for hiding my personal life at work?,"I'm in a little trouble at work because I've been sort of hiding my personal life. I've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. I'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. With that, I never, ever talk about home life. I'm not ashamed of my life I just don't like to discuss it at work. My coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. If I'm asked any questions I usually redirect or move on to someone else. In this manner, none of my coworkers knew I'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

We hired Melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. She spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. However, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. Try as she did, I never gave her anything. My coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. Compartmentalization aside, I've made some great friendships at work. There are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. They are a big part of my life but I'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. They're hugely important and come before everything else but I'm not a sycophant and I enjoy the ten hours a day I'm at work when I get to be an adult and talk about things other than JoJo Siwa and the newest Jenndashian exploit.

Last week, Friday, Melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. At lunch she announced to everyone that I am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. I play softball, I kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that I'm on Facebook. She couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. I use a shortened version of my name (Ali from Alexandra) and my married name on FB so I'm not sure how she found me, unless she used WhitePages and put two and two together. I've already reported her to HR.

But the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a BFD. One of my friends said she's hurt that I don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". I tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, I just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. I never bring work home. When I'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. Heck, I chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when I'm not there. I've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. I honestly don't see the problem. I've never lied to them, I've never given them false info, I've never made up wild tales about my life. I'm still the same person I was, now they just know more about me than they did.

AITA?

ETA: I know this has been posted three times today. I didn't know Reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and I thought it was the account I was posting from so I created a second throwaway and then a third because I never got confirmation the post was uploaded. I couldn't even get past the white screen with the little Reddit face spinning in the center. Those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. This one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

ETA:  I don't have any sort of interesting update. HR brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us WTF is going on. I presented my side, as detailed above, Melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. I asked my HR rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. There were several. Then I asked him to search my married name, or the one I go by on FB, ""Ali Smith"". There were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. In any case, too many to count. I haven't touched my own page since I reported the incident. It was about thirty names from the top but like I said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. I do have an Instagram page that's on private but I only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. She found me night before last and friended me. Naturally I blocked her. HR gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. My rep wasn't sure why Melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called BS on her for claiming it was innocent. So that's that. That's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. However, I took the advice from this sub and I'm making amends. They're all most receptive. I'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. But they know enough about me to know I'm not an automaton or anything.",Not the A-hole
"AITA if I don't donate all or even part of my inheritance (about $725,000)? My cousin say's it's ""blood money"" and claims she's donating 100% of her share.","Using a throwaway since money is involved here. Lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. 

I was born in South Africa but emigrated when I was just a few months old so I am totally American. I come from a family of full on Apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for America. My parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. They made a small fortune in South Africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. To be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the US, but still the money because they were white and well connected in South Africa. 

My grandmother died recently. She lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in SoCal so I figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe I'd get some family heirlooms. My head about popped off when I saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). Money that will literally change my life. 

My parents business failed so I wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. She's also now married, lives in Rancho Santa Fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. She claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in South Africa. She is seriously chiding me that *if* I plan on keeping it, then I am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

I have student loans I could pay off, I could actually have a down payment on a house, I could invest, I mean...I know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. I understand where it came from but I also can't possibly imagine giving it away. I have no idea what charities are like in South Africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and I'm better off just keeping it. 

I understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?,"My (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

We go in and find out we are having a boy. My wife immediately bursts into tears and I hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. She doesn't stop crying the whole day. I let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

It's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

Now that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip. I felt awful but I feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous.

AITA For telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce,"Yeah, I'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

I came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

She's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.

Stuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

Anyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

I decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

Wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. Say it's going to emotionally scar her. But quite frankly, I think she needed to be told.

AITA for not paying for the meal?,"On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.

The waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. ""How were we supposed to know?"" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

She sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.

I told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

I told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

AITA : 17 year old entered my car and stole things of value and his mother thinks an apology is enough...,"Update: This is on AITA because I have had an intrinsic debate. Am I the Asshole for wanting the book thrown at him? For going after a reimbursement or some sort of punishment?  Is he just a kid? Am I being petty?  As someone who is empathetic to others, I have been unsure of my position. However, many of you have made me feel as I am NTA! So, thank you!

Police are dragging their feet and stating that meeting with the family at the behest of the hotel has basically voided our claim to a burglary. The state attorney’s office stated that it’s not true. Let us see if the police and state attorney get it together. 



______________________ ______________________

We had a staycation this weekend. We visited a local luxury resort and parked our car with the valet. Upon departure we found that items were missing. We reported it to the valet and after investigating with the police, they found that some teens were going through the parking lot removing items from cars the valet left unlocked.

Police reports were filed, the people were located and they happened to be guests at the hotel with their family.

We were asked to meet with the mother at 7:00 pm to retrieve our items. 

Let me say that we are not rich. We work fucking hard. We have 3 kids. We work days, nights, weekends to be ok and get ahead. This day/night was some time for our family to enjoy themselves before we headed back to weeks of nonstop work.

Anyways... the mother arrives and sends her son with the security to ‘apologize.’ I stated, I didn’t want an apology, just my things. 

Upon reviewing the bag I was handed, it was incomplete and what was there was damaged. (It was sunglasses, RayBans to be specific, a matching pair that I got my husband and I for Christmas). They were in great condition in their cases in the car. We literally use them in the car and put them back. We’re weird like that. 

Both the mother and son become aggressive, stating that’s all he took and now we got it back so they’re done. 

Ummmm... no.


Did I mention, we work fucking hard?
Your kid STOLE from me. 

She insulted me, called us bad people in front of my kids. She tried to use the ‘you’re a mother,’ card. Yes, I’m a mother but I would sell my kids stuff if he stole from you or I’d make his 17 year old ass work to pay it off. 

She kept stating I was incorrectly stating the value, so, I pulled out the receipt. Don’t you love how they email those things now? 

In the end we left and will proceed with trying to go through court. The entitlement on the woman and her 17 year old grown ass son was too much for me. 

I do not accept your apology. You can’t insult and berate someone and demand I accept your apology without a good faith effort to replace what was lost. 

I was a child, I crashed, my dad paid.
As parents were responsible for our children’s actions and teaching them sorry doesn’t cut it.

AITA for telling somebody to clean up my trash and leaving the restaurant?,"I was at chipotle for lunch today and I was sitting at a 2 person table by myself. I finished eating and went to get a refill, and 2 girls were sitting at my table. I told them that I was still sitting there since I still had 20 mins of lunch left. They pretty much ignored me and said “there’s no more open seats”. So I said fuck it and started to walk away when they said “are you gonna throw away your trash?” which I replied “it’s not my table” and left. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to let my overweight friend ride my horse?,"For background, i have 2 horses. Both are older (mid to late 20s), but one is very old (nearing 30), small (just above pony size and just under 1000 lbs) and has some back and hip issues. She is still in great shape for her age, is very muscular, and still enjoys riding. We trail ride up the mountains near our barn, usually 1.5-2 hours a ride, and they can be difficult and steep, but she does great with me (I am taller but weigh around 115 lbs). 

When I bring friends riding, they ride the smaller, older horse and I ride the younger one. This is because the younger horse is very sensitive and not beginner friendly whereas the older one is not sensitive and great for all levels of riding. Because of aforementioned issues, I am selective about who I let ride her as it’s difficult for her to carry too much weight, especially up the steep hills and for an extended period of time. 

I have a friend who is well over 200 lbs, does not know anything about horses, and asked to ride with me. I said no and was honest about why, but still offered for her to come groom them and spend time with them on the ground. She went straight to the body shaming tactic, I was skinny so I don’t understand, the horse is fine if she’s always galloping around with me, bigger people deserve to ride too, she’s shorter than me so it evens out, I’m gate keeping horses, etc. I just told her my horse was an animal with limitations, not a machine, and that I’m not going to sacrifice her welfare to spare her feelings. She was furious and we haven’t spoken since. Some friends (who all re also not into horses) think one ride would be fine and I’m being an asshole about her weight. I strongly disagree, I even agreed with her that bigger people can ride, they just need a horse suitable for their size and my horse is not that. So, AITA?

To time still so I was curious to see what this sub would think. 

I understand a similar story was posted not that long ago. That was not me, I just joined reddit this week and I’m sorry for the redundancy but I didn’t see that post beforehand.

Edit 2: I love sharing my horses with my friends and wish I had bigger, younger horses so I could take everyone riding! I have many friends who have never ridden before because of weight, some are in great shape and still too big for her, some are overweight and too big for her. Those friends have enjoyed coming to visit and loving on them on the ground, and that invitation was extended to this friend as well. She’s not too big to ride in general, she would just need a horse suitable for her and unfortunately neither of mine fit the bill. Her size and other issues unfortunately severely limits who I can take riding.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my wife she can’t have her dream job because I refuse to be burdened with all of her student debt?,"Throwaway.

My wife and I married young, at 23, and now at 27 she’s about to graduate from law school. The issue is she has a ton of student debt, around 195k from both undergrad and now law school.

But over the past year she’s completely changed her mind about law and becoming a lawyer. She now wants to teach and do Teach For America after graduating. She told me this past week. We’ve talked about this at length and she wants to do this because it’s her new dream job (previously it was law). 

I’m upset because if she teaches her starting salary will barely clear 35k in the first few years and we live in a really, really expensive city. She has no intention of going back into law later as well as she says law school was a mistake. 

Last night we were talking about the future and she mentioned our plans to have kids in a few years and how she’d like to be a stay at home mom in a few years as well. I looked at her and asked how she thinks we’re going to afford that when we’ve got nearly 200k in debt on my one income. She got mad and said I’m trying to use her debt to postpone major life events (like having kids). 

We ended up fighting and I told her she can’t just teach if she expects me to be saddled with her debt as a result. I said she should at least work a high paying job for a few years to repay a good portion. She said I’m prioritizing money over her happiness and that she’s disappointed in my lack of support when they would be my kids and my life as well.

AITA to tell her that if she chooses to go down this path, I may need to rethink our marriage? I haven’t said anything like this yet but I am thinking it. Based on her timeline she’d only work for 3-4 years before becoming a homemaker. I’d have 200k worth of debt to work through completely on my own and I don’t know if I can do it or if it’ll completely ruin the rest of my life. AITA to say this?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not paying to fix the laptop my boyfriend broke in a temper tantrums?,"I (M34) bought my boyfriend (M32) a 2018 Macbook Air on sale a few months ago because he needed a new computer. It did not come with a warranty. Two days ago, he got annoyed at me that I asked him to come to bed (it was 2am), slammed the laptop shut and came.

Then, he discovered the next day that his slamming the laptop shut broke the screen. He started demanding that I pay for it because ""I provoked him"" and because I was so stupid to buy a laptop without a warranty. I told him he should learn not to have temper tantrums.

He has a stable, salaried job. I understand that he doesn't want to pay to fix it, but I don't see how this is my problem.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to stop having a relationship with my bio daughter because my girlfriend is uncomfortable?,"I’ve known my best friend Brenda since we were kids. I was the first person she came out to as a lesbian when we were in our senior year of highschool and fully supported her. 

She met her current wife in college and they got married 6 years later. When I was 27, they both talked to me about wanting to start a family. They asked if I would consider being their sperm donor because they wanted someone they trusted rather than a stranger and who’d be there when their child started to have questions about their donor.

I was honored that they thought of me and agreed to do it. It felt good to help people I care about start their own family. We went through the whole process and a year later, Brenda gave birth to their daughter, Lucy (after Lucy Lawless of course, haha)

Since she was born, I’ve always been present in her life and we have a great uncle/niece type relationship. The 3 of us have been happy with how things are and they’re glad I’m close with Lucy. She’s already been told of how she came into the world (w/o the full details) and while she knows I “helped” build their family, I’m still Uncle Steven to her. 

3yrs after she was born, I began dating my girlfriend. I didn’t tell her about Lucy til 4 months in and it took her time to process this but she eventually came around.

We’ve been together 3 years now and planning on getting married. Last week was Lucy’s 6th b-day and we both were at their house. After cake was cut, we all started taking pics. I told my gf to come so we both could get one with Lucy but she said no. Didn’t think nothing of it until I noticed she was distant and hardly interacting with anyone.

We talked after we got home and she said she didn’t feel comfortable with me seeing Lucy anymore because it still felt weird that I donated sperm and now I’m playing a role in her life when donors don’t do that. This was a shock to me because she never brought it up before. When I said I wasn’t gonna stop, she got frustrated and it became a huge fight. She didn’t understand why I had to be in Lucy’s life and it felt unfair that she has to share me with someone who’s not my legal responsibility. 

At one point she asked if Brenda & I slept together and came up with this donor idea to cover the fact that I knocked her up, and that’s why I’m involved. I get we were both angry but asking that was out of line. I told her I’ll never cut off my relationship with them and left our apartment.
She’s still been trying to convince me for days and to also consider her feelings in all this. 
 
To her, it’s unreasonable to choose a kid that’ll never truly be mine over her: someone I can have a future and a family with. I feel bad that she feels this way, but it seems like she’s not being fair either. It’s been rough and I don’t know who’s right or wrong. She’s making me feel like the bad guy here and I need a neutral party’s help. AITA??",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to pay alimony to my cheating ex-wife,"I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.

So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I’m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend’s husband. Divorced obviously followed.

The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I’d have no problem paying what’s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it’s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.

Now she has no legal recourse (I’ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

The reason I’m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",Asshole
AITA for attacking a muslim’s beliefs when she didn’t want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?,"Long time lurker, here is my first post!

So I (F16) was on a flight from Dubai to new York, so it was quite a long trip. Usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother’s friend couldn’t afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. Our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn’t present during this whole situation.

When we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. I was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

Then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. I saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

I wasn’t paying attention but I took off my headphones when I heard my brother’s friend say no to the lady. She then said: “It is against my religion to touch men in public” and my brother said,

“But we’re not touching you.”

She looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother’s friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. I thought she was so entitled, so I told them,

“Don’t move. Just ignore her.”

She then proceeded to ask me if I knew them, so I said yes. She asked to switch with me. So this is what I said,

“No. I don’t want the middle seat because I’m very claustrophobic (I’m not, I just prefer the aisle seat so I can stretch my legs)” and she said, 

“that’s not my problem.”

That’s when I got really pissed and I said it,

“Your religion is not our problem. Should’ve chosen better seats then” 

Then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that’s the last we saw of her. I’m guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

When we got back from the trip, my brother’s friend told me he was going to move and I wasn’t right to attack her religion like that.

So Reddit, AITA?

AITA for making an insurance claim against my neighbor for hitting my car even though my car is a beater?,"I have an old car that I bought for 2000 dollars when I was 16. I'm 26 now. In the time I've had it, I've learned a lot about car maintenance, I fix it up with junkyard parts and it's pretty cheap to keep running. It's dented and rusty as all hell but it goes and it's cheap.

So anyway, my neighbor parks in his driveway and I park on the street. And he's gotten mad at me for parking in the street because he finds it harder to navigate his big truck around my car. I asked him if he wants me to move my car ahead a bit or behind a bit on the street, because I'm happy to, but I have to park somewhere on the street because I don't have a driveway or garage space. 

He didn't like that, he doesn't want me parking on the street at all. But I'm not about to park on a whole different street then I live at.

Anyway, this week I was sitting on my fire escape reading a book and I saw my neighbor drive out his driveway right into my car's side. I grabbed my phone and started filming asap.

I walked out to the car still filming and got a good video of the damage to the door panel. It was dented and scratched.

Now my car was already pretty beat; it's got body panels from 3 different cars, dents and dings all over, it's got damage to the convertible soft top that I've fixed up with glue and patches, etc. It's a tough old girl.

So the new damage didn't bother me much, I didn't plan on fixing it. But it did bother me that my neighbor hit and run my car. Especially because he knew it belonged to me.

So after a few days of thinking on it, I decided to file an insurance claim. I sent the company the video which had gotten my neighbors license plate in it. I thought they could find his insurance and settle.

The insurance company said that for a hit and run the policy was that I needed to file a police report so I did. 

I wasn't expecting that much but I got a $1600 dollar payout from my neighbors insurance. I guess they appraised my car based on its estimated value based on model and year and didn't pay attention to the fact that it's an absolute beater with a lot of diy fixes. 

Anyway my neighbor is mad at me and came to my house after three insurance thing had paid out and he was looking to yell at me. But my landlord was there in the hallway doing some repairs and when he came looking for which door was mine, my landlord told him that if he wasn't invited to get the hell off his property. Guess he could tell this guy was angry and probably wasn't a good idea to send him up to my room.

I feel a little bad that I hid lol. Feels cowardly. But it was also cowardly he did a hit and run

AITA for ditching my date and causing a scene?,"I’m 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. 

I get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would’ve found me since my page is super private, my username isn’t specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. 
He explains he’s so and so’s friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it’s hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I’m excited and we plan to meet up. 

We catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We’re in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

I study justice so he’s telling me how he’s an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that’s when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.
He keeps asking if anyone knows I’m with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.

I hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn’t DUI, he didn’t want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

I get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he’s taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene “I’m really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me” they catch on and can see I’m upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he’ll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks “who does your mum think your with?” The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

I felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he’d taken the time to see me, I’m not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could’ve stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn’t have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would’ve been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

Edit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I’m super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I’m wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there’s something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I’m the AHole for handling a bad date this way. I see that this isn’t as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here IRL I had very mixed and negative reactions. Hence why I got on here and despite all that, I do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying I did the right thing even though it didn’t necessarily feel like that in the moment.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for leaving my GF upstairs crying to play poker with ""the boys"" downstairs?","A little bit ago, it was my birthday, and my girlfriend had planned out a whole thing for me.

Some background was that I totally *nailed* her last birthday.
We spent the whole day doing her favorite things, had dinner at her favorite restaurant, got a big dessert of her favorite cake, and went back to my place to find... a huge surprise party.
(Gonna go ahead and congratulate myself again because I totally fucking nailed it for her).

I knew that she would try to top it for my birthday, but I really didn't want it.
I don't like making a big deal of my birthday, so just having a beer with my friends is good enough.
I also don't want to be mean, but she's really not that great at planning things.

Unfortunately, she still decided to plan something.

The first part was great.
We went with some of our mutual friends (not my close friends, but good enough) to an escape room and had a great time.
However, afterward, she got really upset when they left and started crying.
When I asked why, it was because everyone had bailed on the second part of her plan: to go drinking on a raft in a nearby body of water.

Now, I should say again that it's winter, and it was raining that day.
The whole idea was pretty bad and *I* didn't want to do it (not that I said that, of course).

We went back to my place, where I found out that my closest friends had planned a poker night for me.
My GF tried arguing with them because she ""knows me better"", but I really wanted to play poker with them.
Apparently she had known that they were planning this, and had tried to keep me away from my house because she wanted the day to be about ""us"".

I was kinda pissed, even though she *had* spent a lot of time planning things for me and we had had fun at the escape room, so I comforted her for a bit, and went downstairs to play poker for the rest of the night.

Now she and her friends are angry with me, because I ""abandoned"" her when she was upset. AITA?

Edit: Clearing some things up:

- That last bit in the paragraph about my girlfriend's birthday was a failed attempt at humor.
Looks like it was a bit hit or miss in the comments, but it was dumb of me to write that.

- My roommate let my friends in for poker.
Big mystery solved.

- This happened around 10 PM (as I've stated in the comments).
I tried to get my girlfriend to play poker with everyone but she refused.

- I guess I didn't say clearly, but I did talk about birthday plans with my girlfriend and asked that they be kept to a minimum.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for getting my husband's cousin a Christmas gift that will definitely make him angry?,"Hear me out.

He (cousin) is a flat earther. He also thinks that space isn't real and the stars are projected onto a screen or something. 

I want to get him a globe. I think it would be fucking hilarious. My friends all think it would be fucking hilarious. My husband says it's up to me. I haven't asked my in laws what they think yet, they will probably tell me no because they are the type of people to never rock the boat. Cousin will be sooooooo pissed, but I think it would be incredibly worth it.

The rest of the in laws are engineers and other sciencey types, this cousin is just a ""conspiritard"" who listens to way too much Alex Jones.

I think that a getting him a globe would just be a bit of harmless fun, but if this is too harsh, a friend of mine also suggested that I get a globe for my husband and just make sure that cousin is present when husband opens it.

I await your judgement, reddit.

Edit: I won't do it. No point in creating drama for no reason. Even if said drama is hilarious. As I said in one of the comments, I'll just silently judge him for being an idiot and then walk away when he gets pissed at me for believing that space is a real thing.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to share my son?,"My son died at age 4. On the first mothers day after he died my husband got me a necklace with some of his ashes in. I wear it every single day.

My Aunt is not someone I see often. She got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. She came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. When we were told he didn't have long left I asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. I figured she was in denial, maybe. I certainly was. She then missed his funeral to go to a concert.

Her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. Apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. I said no because I want him to stay with us. All of him. Then my Aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said I was being selfish, he was her family too. 

I still said no. She said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. But so was I. But it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. She's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old.

AITA for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?,"My wife and I are not from the US but we have lived here for the last 2 years. On a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. However since we are not used to American portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

When we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. We will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. However occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

Last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). When they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. We were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

When we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. He asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. After around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". He gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

AITA here? This seems so foreign to me. We still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? It shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

AITA for not wanting to give my new stepdaughter fine silverware that my mom promised to my daughter?,"My mom passed away some years ago. She was by no means a rich lady but she held onto treasures in the way people from the old days did. 

She had a beautiful antique set of silverware that I admired as a little girl, and that my own daughter loved to look at when we went to visit my mom. My mom promised her she would have it one day. 

Before my mom passed she gifted the silverware to me on the proviso that it went to my daughter when she is old enough. Of course I agreed and it’s stayed in my home since since my daughter wants me to give them to her when she first buys her own home, so obviously a few years away still. 

Since my moms death life has changed for me- I remarried in 2018, my daughter is all grown up at 19, and I have inherited a lovely stepdaughter who is in her 30’s. 

She asked me if she could use the silverware for her wedding this past July, I was uneasy only because the thought of it being stolen etc was on my mind. However her ceremony was very small and intimate so ultimately I changed my mind after asking my daughter her thoughts since ultimately it’s her silverware. 

After her wedding she was asked me repeatedly if she can share the set of silverware with my daughter. She fell in love with it and now has sentimental value to her. I do like my stepdaughter but it’s not my gift to give away, I’m simply holding on to it for my daughter. 

I told her to ask my daughter, my daughter said no. She said it politely. My stepdaughter thinks I am excluding her because she should enjoy this also. I said it’s not my place or my gift to split.

AITA for kicking my pregnant sister-in-law out?,"My brother (29M) and sister-in-law (SIL) (29F) asked Wednesday if they could come for a visit at that weekend. (They 6h away). We said sure, love to see you. Friday afternoon, I (34F) had an ultrasound for my 8 week pregnancy. The ultrasound showed a likely miscarriage. My husband (35M) & I were upset, but as my bro & SIL were already driving, we didn't cancel the visit. We hadn't told them about the pregnancy, nor had we told our 3 kids.

When bro & SIL arrive they were excited to tell us SIL is pregnant, and due 2 weeks before I would have been due. I tried to sound excited and happy for them but I wasn't as excited as I normally would have been. Then it turned into a nightmare.

She didn't like supper; so we ordered in food for her. She needed the bed moved from 1 wall to another. Fine. She insisted on 5 pillows to sleep. I found a couple & she was upset I couldn't give her more & asked if she could go into the kids rooms and take theirs. I said no.

Next morning, she freaked out at 7 am that the kids were eating cereal too loud. She spent the morning curled up on the couch complaining about morning sickness. I  sympathized and said it's awful, but it will go away. She screamed ""No, you've never experienced this- they gave me the same anti-nauseau drugs they give chemo patients so shut up!"" I got quiet. My husband was making brunch and she freaked out that he was going to cook bacon because ""the smell makes me vomit."" We didn't make bacon. She also didn't want us to make eggs or let the kids have syrup on their pancakes. I refused, so she stormed off into her room until mid- afternoon. 

Midafternoon she decides to go shopping and said they'd be back for dinner. We said dinner would be at 5:30. At 5:45 they hadn't show up, and weren't replying to texts, so we ate. They showed up at 6 and she freaked out that we hadn't waited so we ordered pizza. She spent the next two hours complaining about how brutal pregnancy is and how it sucks so much and how she's never going through it again. I lost it & told her that I was in the middle of a miscarriage and I'd love to have her problems because it means my baby would be ok. Everything got quiet and she looked at me and said ""I can't believe you'd use the ""M"" (miscarriage) word around me. That's bad luck, and if I lose the baby it's your fault!"" and went to her room and slammed the door. About 15 min later she said ""I'm glad you lost your baby. You already have 3, and if you had one right now, you'd just be trying to upstage me. I'm glad your baby is dead.""

I burst into tears, and my husband told her to get out. He said ""I've watched you complain, whine and bitch all weekend. We stayed quiet about what was going on with us because we though you deserved a chance to enjoy sharing your news. But this is enough. Get out now.""

She started screaming about how we are TA while my brother packed their stuff and they left. So, are my husband and I TA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for leaving/ghosting my GF that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me,"**UPDATE:** 

I was not expecting to post an update so soon, but I was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

Over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. However I had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. However of course they know that I can't avoid work. So they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as I get home from work. With them is my girlfriend. They insist I talk to my girlfriend and I eventually relent and our parents leave.

Once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. Saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... Basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...And then she gives the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. She says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. This emotional support quickly turned physical

This makes NO sense. We have ALWAYS talked about having kids excitedly.

She takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. She also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if I don't believe her. So she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. She says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. I ask to see her phone. She reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since I threw her out.

I tell her I need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. Once outside I lock the doors, unblock her on WhatsApp, and send her a long text. I'm reciting this by memory so I don't have to open WhatsApp and see her reply.

>Whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. But you should know the following. First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test. This child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. I will never forgive you for that.

I have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. I also won't post any updates after this. I get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so I'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

**Original Post**

----------------------------------------------------

**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.

-------------------------

My gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

Last week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

Anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.

So I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

Anyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?

AITA For Not Telling My GF Why I'm Tall?,"I'm M23 and my Gf is f24 we've been together for a year. Back when I was 18 I went abroad for uni and I started getting taller slowly at first, I was about 5'5 when I left and slowly after about 7 months I was 5'10. I went to the Dr in the country I was studying in and they assured me I was in puberty still and I'm just getting taller. I went home for the summer and everyone was surprised that I'm like a normal height now and it was nice being taller. I had no medical symptoms so didn't go to the Dr in my country since I was healthy. I was still growing slightly and I was around 6ft tall when I left back to go abroad for school in the fall.

Once I got back to school I started having a lot of migraines and dizzyness etc. It was pretty mild so I stupidly ignored it for a few months but I was still growing and about 6'2 by the winter. I went to a large hospital near my uni instead and they gave me a brain scan and MRI and they discovered I had a smallish tumor on my pituitary glad and this was causing my symptoms and crazy height gain. The tumor was stimulating the gland to release high amounts of HGH. I flew back home ASAP and my parents took me to the hospital and thankfully it was benign and it was removed easily. So after all that I'm 6'3.5 after about 2 yrs of having this tumor while both my parents are 5'3. So I was destined to be short and all my kids probably were too.

I met my GF last year and I basically have no health problems from it, I just go in for check ups on my hormones and a brain scan every 6 months. I told my GF that I had a brain tumor but it wasn't a big deal and she didn't care too much about it since we dealt with it. I didn't tell her it caused me to get tall because idk she never asked and none of my friends or family cared and no one talks about it.

She found a picture of me at my prom and I looked really short and she was like wow you grew so much and I told her ya its because of that tumor I told you about. She was surprised and asked more about it so I non chalantly told her what happened and how I would have been 5'5 if it didn't.

To my surprise she got mad and said that I was lying to her about my height and that if we had kids they would be short since everyone in my family is. Which is true my genes didn't change, my kids would probably also be short. Called me a huge asshole and has been distant with me for a couple of days.

For context she's 5'6

&#x200B;

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*\*

For everyone messaging me asking if my dick got bigger during this the answer is yes it did. But the doctors I saw all agree that it was because I was still in the latter stages of puberty still (late bloomer). But its still in the average range, just in the higher part of that range now lol.

AITA for forcing a special needs child off my child's soccer team because of the actions of her mother?,"My husband and I are 54 and 56. We've been married almost 39 years. Yes, we got married at 17 and 19. Our daughter was a surprise late in life pregnancy when I was 49. For some reason, I've always looked much younger than my age. I'm usually estimated to be in my early to mid thirties. Gets annoying at times now, but it's okay. My grandmother was the same way. My husband looks his age. I worry about the severe generation gap and finding friends with similarly aged kids, so I try to keep up with younger pop culture and technology.

We signed our daughter up for soccer this year. We were at our daughter's soccer practice last Saturday, and a mom came up to me when my husband was off getting coffee. We talked, which went well. When my husband came back, she went stone cold and excused herself.

All this week, this woman has launched a campaign against me and my entire family. She thinks my husband and I have a 30-40 year age difference, which is ""inappropriate"". She thinks our relationship is based on money (?!), that it ""sets a bad example for young girls"" and I especially should ""think about what my daughter is learning"". The team parents were starting to be against me, and I needed to respond.

I was infuriated by all of this. I try to keep a mentality of ""age only means what you let it"" and care for my appearance and stay more modern, but I wouldn't think I'm trophy wife level. I sent a mass email with what I think is a toned down reaction to this woman's judgement and three things: my wedding announcement from 1981, my daughter birth announcement (which showed our ages), and a picture of me heavily pregnant, with my husband, at my 50th birthday party.

The woman was humiliated in front of all of the parents on the team, so much so that she had to leave because they all refused to work with her at all. Her child has special needs, and this is one of the most inclusive teams. Many of the leagues around won't allow special needs children because they ""can't accommodate"". I feel bad that now her child can't experience sports, but maybe she earned it? We're not leaving this one because it is more accepting of non-traditional families and works best with our schedule. AITA?

Edit: We married so young because we both had very...harsh homes and were in love (still are!). At the time, marriage meant automatic emancipation and you had better economic chances pairing up. We do have more money than most parents of young children because my husband and I are naturally not very fertile. We were essentially dual income no kids for over 30 years. We took an ""if it happens, it happens"" approach to kids and stopped preventing after we both had graduated college.",Not the A-hole
"AITA - I moved for my husband's job, my kids now hate me","Bit long, stick with me. Throwaway because I'm active on a mom board, and haven't discussed this there.

My ex and I split 5 years ago now. We had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. He's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. After my divorce, I reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. He's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. We married 2 years ago. 

A year ago, he got orders to move to Texas from where we all were in California. My older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. I approached my ex and told him the situation. I said I know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. He blew his top and said absolutely not, I wouldn't ""take his kids away"" and said he'd see me in court.

The judge ended up ruling in his favor, and I was awarded summers and every other holiday. I was absolutely devastated. I moved, and I've barely seen the kids since. They came at Christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. The older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on FaceTime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. My daughter has said I chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but I can tell he's angry. 

I've asked my ex to talk to them about it and he basically said I chose to leave, it's my fault and he's not getting involved in ""our issues"". So, let me have it Reddit, AITA?",Asshole
AITA for yelling at my husband for eating the wrong cookies?,"This is some petty ass nonsense

I(37F) made fancy cookies for a friend’s birthday this past week. The amount of planning that went into these cookies was silly TBH. Slowly but surely I collected the ingredients I needed through annoying ass grocery and amazon orders and miraculously had everything I needed to make these cookies on time for my BFF’s birthday.  Baking them was also a hassle - I had to bake them in small batches in order to correct the dough until I got the perfect cookie. So I’m running back and forth to the kitchen for hours while also taking care of my 10 month old son. I made extra cookies because my hubby has a sweet tooth. 

Hubby (38M) comes home from work and is super excited that I made cookies. I tell him how hard I’ve been working on these tricky ass cookies and tell him very specifically that there are 6 cookies that he must not eat that are perfect in size and shape and decoration and will be given to my BFF.  I TELL HIM THIS TWICE because I can’t stand the thought of having to deal with more cookie decorating. I even separated the ‘off limit’ cookies from the rest so it’s obvious which ones are not meant for him. He nods in acknowledgement. That evening he’s back and forth, in and out of the kitchen eating cookies (getting chocolate on the fucking sofa as he eats them) At some point I check on the perfect 6 gift cookies to see if the decorations have set and - what’s this?! One of the 6 quarantined cookies is missing! 

I asked hubby why he ate one of the special cookies and he laughed. ‘Oh honey the other cookies were too big and I just wanted one last small cookie’. I was only a little mad at first but kind of shocked.  ‘I told him ‘I can’t believe you just did that when I asked you not to twice! WTF dude?’

His reaction ‘It’s not a big deal sweetie. Are you really going to get upset over a cookie? There are so many cookies left, just use one of the others. Or give her 5 instead of 6.’

At that point I got a little more angry.  I told him that I wanted an apology and that he was being inconsiderate.  He rolled his eyes at me and apologized sarcastically and muttered that he would sleep on the couch tonight ‘because we’re arguing about cookies now.’ He said I was being immature for arguing with him about cookies. He gives me the silent treatment for the rest of the night and slept on the chocolate stained sofa. 

Now I’m fucking pissed and confused. Am I an asshole because I made a big deal out of this stupid cookie situation?

AITA for contesting an entire will to avoid a clause I didn't agree with?,"Using a throwaway. I am the only child of my parents. They set their will up to have me inherit about 70% of their estate, with the stipulation that I donate/tithe 10% of my portion to their church. My parents' siblings had the rest divided among them. 

Here's the thing: I don't view churches to be a worthy cause to give to in general. I actually view it to be unethical to make the churches richer while actual worthy causes suffer. Beyond that, that particular church had a horrible effect on my childhood that I'm still working through as an adult. I can't on moral or ethical grounds give money to my abusers. 

They had another clause where if someone contests the will, everyone's portion gets tied up in court and it's very possible that no-one gets anything. My case extended legal proceedings for almost 9 months longer than it would have been, but I was able to argue and win that the church could be substituted for any non profit charity. I chose Planned Parenthood, RAINN, and Saving Our Sisters, the three organizations that I felt best counteracted the religion I was raised in, and split 25% (15% extra) of my inheritance between them. 

I've been getting flak from all of my extended family, who say that I should have honoured my parents last wishes and not dragged everyone through months of court because I ""couldn't control my emotions"". I don't agree, and I honestly couldn't live with myself having given a single dime to a religious group or religious institution. I would have forfeited the entire thing if I had to to not do it.

Edit: The legal proceedings have since ended. The reason that they set the will up that way was that they wanted me to personally have to sign the check to the church in an effort to draw me in. I didn't realize this wasn't obvious.",Not the A-hole
AITA thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up...,"Yeah, I know this sounds awful.

My (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant. 

She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic.

The problem I have with this is:

1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it.

2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her.""

I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her?

As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it.

I fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

AITA for bringing a really sassy doctor's note to school for a medical excemption?,"
So my school made this dumb rule that nobody can have a water or drink bottle with them because a couple seniors got caught drinking vodka at school.

The only exception is if you have a form signed by your doctor saying there's a medical reason you need it. And carry the note with you whenever you have a water bottle so you can show it to teachers or administration.

Now, my doctor who i have my yearly checkup with is also one of my mom's best friends, and last week she and her daughter were coming around to hang out with our family.

I was telling her and my mom about the school rule and they thought it was silly too. My doctor was talking about how unhealthy it was to not let kids drink water all day, and sell them sugary sodas at lunch 

I asked if she'd sign a doctor's note allowing me a water bottle and she said od course. So I printed out the form and she signed it. There was a section saying to describe the medical need and she wrote ""water is necessary for life"" which my  mom thought was funny but also thought might get the note rejected, like it was obviously meant for specific medical conditions or disabilities. 

But she said that if anyone had a problem with it, to have them call her and they'd get a piece of her mind.

So I took the note to school and a bunch of teachers told me I couldn't have a water bottle and I said I had a note. Most of them didn't read it closely enough to see the reson but out of the two that did, one laughed about it and asked if it was real. I said it was, she could call the number on the form. She seemed satisfied.

The other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.

I know my doctor hadn't meant it as a joke about actual medical problems...

AITA for Having Professional Hair and Makeup for a Wedding When the Bride Didn’t,"Hi, y’all.

My brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on Sunday. I (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while I was a guest, I wasn’t in the bridal party. 

They got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. The dress code on the invitation was “formal.” For the three weddings I’ve been to with formal dress codes (and the eight I’ve been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. That is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. A few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my SIL could hire locally. 

Well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. When her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn’t used a professional either, nor had she. 

It was kind of awkward in pictures, but I didn’t really see a big deal.

Well, yesterday, I got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to “upstage her” and that sort of thing. Quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (FYI, my brother thought I looked pretty and didn’t see an issue except “when did you become a woman?”)

I’ve tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they’re having none of it. Was I really a bitch?

AITA for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight?,"So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he’s even attempting to board. I’m mentally crossing my fingers he’s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:

“Sir, I’m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you’re taking up quite a bit of my seat”. 

He wasn’t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there’s not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn’t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I’m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren’t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn’t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. 

The guy seemed embarrassed and didn’t want to get up. He mentioned how he can’t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he’ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here’s where I made my offer. 

I told the guy, “Look, I’ll put up with this if you give me $150 — that’s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.”

He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. 

Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn’t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person’s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn’t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

After the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? ",Asshole
AITA for banning my kids from my in-laws house because they keep forcing their religion on them?,"I was born in Saudi Arabia. I escaped by convincing my parents I just wanted to visit family in Canada, and the moment I got the chance I sneaked out of my uncle's house and went straight to a women's shelter. They helped me apply for asylum. I am now a proud citizen of the Great White North, I even got a maple leaf tattoo the day after the paperwork was complete. I'll never forget the first time I bit into a pulled pork sandwich. I almost cried. It was like tasting freedom.

I am now married to an incredible man with two kids (8M and 7F). He's also an ex-Muslim, but was born and raised in Canada. His parents are first-generation Pakistani, and well, they don't like me very much. They blame me for my husband's atheism, even though he's told them several times he was an atheist before we met.

The biggest point of contention is how differently they treat our kids. One incident in particular that a caused a pretty big fight was when my kids told me their grandparents prevent my son from cleaning up after himself and make his sister do it. My husband reamed them pretty hard about this, so I was hoping they'd start to respect our boundaries, but yesterday I found something that really bothered me.

We pay my SIL (16F) to babysit. Yesterday when I got home from work, I saw she'd forgotten to log out of her Facebook. I went to log her out, but then something caught my eye - it was a picture of my kids with their grandparents, my daughter wearing a hijab. I investigated further, and realized my in-laws were blocking me from seeing these pictures.

It felt like steam was coming out of my ears. I understand to many Westerners it's just a piece of cloth, but to ex-Muslim women it's a symbol of our oppression, and I don't want my daughter wearing it until she's old enough to understand what it represents. If she decides to wear it as an adult I won't stop her, but for now, I don't want her wearing it.

My husband and I made this crystal clear when they first bought my daughter a hijab, and we told them to return it. They tried to convince my daughter it was just for dress-up, and that just pissed me off more because they don't even let my SIL wear makeup. They don't care about dress-up, they care about brainwashing my kids.

My husband and I banned the kids from his parents house, and now his whole extended family is sending us nasty messages. It looks like we're going to have to find a new babysitter, too, but that's a price I'm willing to pay to prevent my children from being brainwashed. Are we assholes?",Not the A-hole

I've been with my boyfriend for 7 months and he's small down there, like 4 inches give or take. He constantly asks me if it's big enough, if I can feel it, and I always reassure him and tell him he's fine. I tell him I'm not with him for his penis and he has nothing to worry about.

 However the last few days he got increasingly agitated and kept asking me if I was lying, if he's too small, and wouldn't take ""You're fine"" or ""You're average"" or ""I don't care how big it is"" for an answer. I told him to stop pestering me but this went on for a few more days until I snapped and told him he's below average but he has nothing to worry about. Obviously he didn't take it well.

She had tried saying that I told her she could use my name, but even if I did, (which I know I didn’t because I would remember something like this) it’s the fact she didn’t pay a penny for two years, since she opened the account. She said things to me like I ruined Christmas, how terrible I am treating her, I don’t appreciate anything she does for me, and tried holding college over my head saying she isn’t going to help me do anything, or pay anything for my college if I try to do anything about the electric. Some of the things were so bad that my fiancé said I should delete the messages so I don’t have to look at them whenever I get on my phone.

After much thought and consideration, I decided to shut the power off, I gave my mom some time to figure something else out for the power to the house and I’m not sure if she thinks I’m serious or not but I intend on closing the account. She now has basically disowned me, and after talking to my little brother, (He’s 18), I heard how she tried turning my siblings against me, telling them how terrible I am and twisting the situation in favor of her. 

My friends think I should sue her, but as my mother I don’t think I could bring myself to do it,  I told her I’ll take the debt on but I’m not letting the account stay open.



Edit: Hey all, thanks for the Santa’s last ride. I noticed a lot of comments on this, I want to get to them all and try to read them all. As of now there’s a few questions about why it wasn’t shut off earlier and accrued so much debt,  to be honest, I’m not sure, I called the company and they transferred me to a few different departments such as payments, billing, account services, etc. but most of the workers there said they aren’t sure either and they’re going to look into it and let me know what comes up. As things progress I’ll update this in the future and if anyone is curious as to what happens you can check back. Thank you all for any advice and support given and I’m taking it all into consideration. I can’t let this just slide, the consequences would be too dire.",Not the A-hole
AITA for firing my sister after seeing her blog and not rehiring her without an apology?,"Basically what happened is read my sisters blog. It was sent to me by a friend of mine who was asking if one of the “characters” was me. Spoiler alert, it was me.

Its couple years old and really popular. She doesn’t use our family’s real names but they are very similar and use the same first letter. So think real names: Katy, Julia, Marissa and Brad then the fake names being: Kathy, June, Marnie and Bob.

It’s descriptive enough of our lives and what we do for work that my friend identified me from it.

Its mostly about her and her life but there is still a lot about us.

A year ago I had an abortion. It was during the lowest point in my life so far and only she and my husband knew about it. She swore to me that she would take the secret to her grave. Yeah, she dedicated a whole entry to it.

A couple months ago she and her husband got laid off due to world events. I run my own business that wasn’t really affected and I offered her a job there to help her out. She’s not qualified in my field so I essentially made up a position for her so she could have a steady paycheck. She basically does data entry and other random tasks online from her home.

Her blog since then has basically centred on how much she hates it. She called it demeaning work and says a bunch of bullshit about how I obviously don’t respect her intelligence. I say this is bullshit because 1. She would need years of training to work any of the open positions 2. I told her what she would do when I offered it and she gushed about how grateful she was and that I was really helping her.

I called her and told her what I had read and how hurt I was. Her defence is that the blog is her online diary where she vents and that I should know not to take any of it personally. She actually had the gall to tell me that she is hurt that I read it! Apparently the right thing to do was ignore it??

I told her off for telling the internet my secrets and dragging me online where I could be, AND WAS, found by people who know me. She just said she did all her due-diligence by changing the names and it wasn’t her fault my friend found it.

We argued for a bit, it got increasingly heated, and I fired her. I told her that if she couldn’t apologize or see how she was wrong here, then she wasn’t who I thought she is and she could find a job where she felt more respected.

It’s been a week and I haven’t spoken to her at all. Her husband has been contacting me on her behalf trying to get her job back as they need the money. He claims she is sorry but I think if she was, then she could tell me herself.

My own husband is telling me I am overreacting and that she’s family and I should just forget it. I don’t agree.

Am I the asshole here?

TLDR: Sister drags me and reveals my secrets on her blog and I fire her, am I the asshole?

EDIT/UPDATE: After reading a lot of the response I have become more and more sickened by this situation. I sent my sister an email detailing how much damage this is doing to me emotionally and could do to me financially and professionally. In the email I am asking her to delete all entries in her blog that include private details about me, my business or our family.

I am giving her an ultimatum. She can do as I asked, delete the entries, and I will consider it water under the bridge. We can move on with our lives and try to repair our relationship.

OR

She can continue to ignore me, keep her blog, and can consider me out of her life. We can see each other at family events and keep things civil but I will no longer share my life with her. She wont be an aunt to my future children or a real sister to me.

Ill update if and when she responds.

EDIT/UPDATE 2: She replied to my email asking me to facetime her tomorrow. She wants to talk to me after we both have had the night to cool down. I agree with her as I am pretty heated right now.

Will update after our talk. Thank you everyone for the support, has really opened my eyes to the gravity of the situation.

FINAL UPDATE:

I talked to my sister early this morning. We had a really productive conversation! I won’t go into too much detail since it was a long and emotional call.

The reason she had not reached out during the week we weren’t talking was a bit surprising. It turns out her husband knew about the blog but had never read it at her request. After our blow up he wanted to see what had made me so upset. She allowed him to read some of the entries and he ended up siding with me. There was also some information on him and his family that he was upset about so they were having a separate fight about that.

I guess my email to her put into perspective to her how much damage her blog and the information she shared there could affect others. She showed me over the videochat that she actually deleted the whole thing. She told me that the blogging started out as a place to vent, but when it got more popular people started emailing her asking for updates on certain “characters” (ie her family) and she started seeing hundreds of comments. She became obsessed with it basically.

She apologized for sharing my secrets and for being ungrateful about the job. She claims that she was exaggerating in the blog to get more views and likes and I can see that. 

Our relationship is damaged but not beyond repair. She is not coming back to work for me, instead I am just sending them a small amount of money to help cover their rent. It not as much as she was making but I really do love her and I still want to help her. Once one of them gets a job they will get back on their feet. This way they at least have less stress.

Once things start to reopen in our area she promised to set up a regular therapy appointment where she can vent all she wants and get actual advice. As well as help for what she described as a “blogging addiction”.

I want to thank everyone for the comments. Some of them were harsh and some of them were crazy but it helped a lot to figure out how I actually felt about the situation

AITA for telling people my sister's youthfulness comes from plastic surgery and fillers?,"My sister is 34 and I'm 40, but since our early 20s people have always assumed she's the older sister. 

I don't know why she seems to have aged early or why I look younger - I was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. I used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

I moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. Last weekend I went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and I was shocked by her appearance.

I knew she used botox, but this was next level. Her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. I asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". I'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

She asked me not to tell anyone and I said of course I wouldn't. But then...

Now, I thought she looked weird because I know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

I was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""It's probably because I didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

As a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, I was hurt by that. Without thinking I blurted out (louder than I'd intended): ""Oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

I regretted it before I'd even finished saying it, but I thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

My mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. My brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. Pretty much everyone else thinks I am a massive asshole.

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to cook for my teenage kids?,"I am a single mom to my two kids Jenny (15) and Mark (17). They are good kids and I love them to death but they have both adopted very specific diets. It started with Mark getting into weight lifting/body building last year.

He is on a “cut” right now and is dieting like crazy. He gave me a list of approved foods for his diet and its basically just chicken, broccoli, brown rice, tuna, lentils, potatoes. There a couple more veggies that I’m “allowed” to cook with but that’s basically it.

Mark was a really chubby kid and I know the body building was a huge turning point for him so I want to support him. I was cooking two meals for the family every night, one for him and one for Jenny and I. It was a bit stressful but I was managing.

About a month ago Jenny told me she was going vegan. This is something she wants to do for ethical and environmental reasons and I support her. She gave me a book of vegan recipes to use.

Making a full vegan meal for one kid and a “body building” meal for the other takes 2 hours minimum if you include planning, prep, cooking and cleaning. The ingredients for these diets are pricey so our grocery bills have skyrocketed. Marks hates spice, Jenny loves spice. Jenny hates lentils and broccoli so I can’t even try to combines some of their meals

Both kids hate cooking and refuse to help. They make their own breakfast but not lunch so I have to portion their dinners so they can bring leftovers.

Yesterday I was just exhausted and just didn’t want to cook. I told the kids to order takeout when I went to take a nap. Well I woke up from my nap to two pissed off kids.

Both of them were giving me shit for not cooking; Mark bitching takeout food is too greasy, Jenny bitching there weren’t any vegan restaurants in our area.

Something inside me broke. I just started crying and told them both they were on their own from now on. I would buy the groceries but I wasn’t cooking another damn meal.

Jenny called me a shit mom and ran off to her room and Mark just rolled his eyes at me.

Neither kid is talking to me right now and I just feel like shit. I wanna support my kids in whatever they do. At the same time, I just can’t cook anymore. My whole life is just work, cook, sleep.

Am I an asshole? Are my kids right, am I a shit mom?

tldr: Both my kids have specific diets and want me to cook for them. I am tired of it and am going on a cooking strike.

EDIT: I honestly cant believe the amount of comments I am getting. I just logged in after making the post this morning and I am just overwhelmed.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the support. I am sobbing right now.

With regards to my kids. Please know that they are really wonderful kids that are going though a rough time and not dealing with it the right way.  Their father hurt them, and is still hurting them, deeply. I am saving up to afford therapy for them. Hopefully in a couple months I can get them into a session.

I grew up in a household where my mom was superwoman... just did it all with a smile. I wanted to be that for my kids. After my ex husband left us, I tried to hold onto it.

I see now that I just did them a huge disservice. I will be strong in this and they will learn to fend for themselves, one way or another. I am receiving a lot of great advice and I take it to heart.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for going to the gym during ""women's hour""?","I recently moved into this particular apartment complex because its a lot closer to my work and it has a pretty spectacular gym. The gym fees are built into my monthly rent payment, about $40 and is optional. I elected to pay it because I'm an avid gym-goer. I've been going to the gym at my usual time of around 6:30ish and at first I was oblivious to the fact that during the times that I go, its all women - who usually give me pretty dirty looks but I thought nothing of it. I made a friend in my complex and when she saw me at the gym she was super surprised to see me. Unbeknownst to me, there is a women's hour every weekday from 6p-9p. Now look. I know that us dudes can be big creeps and it can be annoying for a woman to try to get off a workout in peace. But I think that 3 hours is far too excessive. I ended up leaving that day to keep the peace though.

Those times make it incompatible for me to go the gym which is open 6a - midnight. I work 8:30a to 5:00p and I usually come home at around 5:30ish, depending on traffic. Usually I like to chill for about half an hour after getting home to decompress and I either make food for later or just browse the twitter or reddit. Now I know that I could wake up early to go....but imma be real honest and say that I'd rather not do that because I like my sleep. What makes it even worse is that the nearest gym is a 40!!!!!! minute drive away. Which is a no bueno for me.

So I thought about it and escalated this matter to the strata manager and I asked her about the women's hour because I was not informed of this prior to signing my lease. Apparently its not a policy instituted by the strata, but the tenants (who are mostly women) agreed on this policy as a community and the strata neither endorses nor discourages this policy. I was prepared to give up and make do with the other gym but first I inquired about getting my monthly gym fee waived if I won't be going there. Strata manager said that she can't do that until my lease is up for renewal in a year. So I said eff that, I won't be paying for a service that I won't use.

So I go to the gym. I make sure to go out of my way to not look at or talk to any of the women there because I want to leave them alone, and vice versa. I just work out and keep my head down.

Today one woman tapped me on the arm (more like hit me if i'm being real) and said ""you know it's women's hour right"" and I said yeah I know that but the window makes it pretty much impossible for me to work out at other times so I have to go now. Oh and please don't touch me. She got pissed and told me to get out. I refused and ignored her and continued my workout whilst all the other women gave me extremely dirty looks. AITA?

Edit: wow I woke up and didn't expect to see this blow up. just to answer a few questions: some people have asked why the nearest gym is so far away - this is because I live in a town that's a satellite town of a major metro area. think Mississauga or Abbotsford or something like that

Some have also asked why I don't talk to the women in there. that's because I agree with women's hour in the sense that I do believe they need their own time to workout, I just heavily disagree with the manner in which they're doing it. so Im not going to the gym to talk to anybody....Im just going to workout. I really make an effort and go above and beyond to not appear as if Im ""creeping"" on these women, like I said I just go and keep my head down.

I suppose I could try to get the policy changed but, again, the overwhelming majority of tenants are women (it was the strata manager that told me this). so I would imagine I'd have a hard time getting my voice heard. You know what, now I know how women feel like when they're in a job or something in which they're overwhelmingly the minority in gender, it can kind of suck.",Not the A-hole
AITA for preventing my daughter from getting a new phone/allowance?,"Forgive me if I get heated in this post, but this situation makes me extremely angry. 

A few months ago, my daughter smashed her iPhone for a social media post. In the post, she said “it’s okay, my parents will buy me a new one.” The thing is, I definitely would have bought her a new one that same day and would have never known if it wasn’t for the fact her brother tipped me off and showed me the post. 

Her father and I were obviously extremely angry. We both came from rough childhoods and worked hard to build a good life for our kids, so to see her take advantage of that was extremely upsetting in a way I can’t even describe. Her father and I are divorced, but we sat down and agreed that 1) we are cutting off her allowance, and her purchases now have to come through us, 2) we will never buy her a new phone but we might consider a flip phone when she goes to college, 3) we will monitor her social media to make sure she’s not participating in damaging content, 4) if she gets a job and wants a new phone, she first has to pay us back for the phone she destroyed, 5) we won’t buy her a car when she turns 16. 

As I said, a few months have passed and I still feel the same way, but her dad has softened and he thinks her “attitude’s changed”. He says that we might be “too harsh” over a “teenager’s mistake” and we should at least give her an allowance for chores and change “we’re never buying you a phone ever” to “going a year without a phone.”

Personally, I don’t care if all kids have one. She has an iPad with social media and a Macbook. She can still message her friends. But I refuse to get her another phone. If she wants one, she can get a part time job and work for it so she can see how much work goes into getting a phone. But I don’t see value in giving more money to a kid who doesn’t know the value of money. I rather my daughter be unhappy for a few years over a phone than raise another spoiled and out of touch asshole for the world. 

Her dad respects my opinion and agreed he won’t give her a phone or allowance, but now my daughter is pissed at me and calling me “a narcissist” and “controlling”. However, my actions are a direct result of her misbehavior and I am not preventing her from getting a phone; she is free to work and buy one at any point. However, I think I might be the asshole because my daughter will be punished for years over one mistake. AITA here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being angry at my husband for spending my tummy tuck money,"***UPDATE on my profile as mods did not approve the update on the AITA sub*** 

Repost, sorry if you read this already

My husband (37) and I (35) have been together for just over 11 years. We have 3 beautiful children. Before we were engaged we talked about having babies. I said I always wanted to be a mom BUT I will be getting the ""mommy makeover package"" after I'm done. This is a tummy tuck and possible breast lift. I was very clear that I would want us to start saving as soon as I was pregnant with the first baby. 

First pregnancy hits, and it hits hard and true to our promise, we start saving. After my first child was born we found out my abdominal muscles had separated and needed to be repaired surgically. This is essential a tummy tuck. Since giving birth to my first I have experienced horrible back pain and back spasms due to the seperation, but we wait and had 2 more babies 

My youngest is now almost 1 year old so I brought up the surgery to my husband. He asked me if I was sure I wanted the surgery. Lol yes, I am VERY SURE. He asks me why I want it, which I found insane since I have been talking about it for 8 years straight. I told him 1. I look pregnant all the time due to the seperation and I hate it. It makes me feel awful and sad and 2. The pain was getting unbearable (even with therapy). 

Well he tells me I'm being very vain and that he doesn't think I should have it, he completely ignored the pain part. I start to get confused and ask to see the account where it's being saved (to clarify, we are both on this account but it was never linked to my online banking. I saw the balance last month at 15k). He became silent and left the house. I was very very confused so I called up the bank. They told me the account had under 1k left. 

I burst into hysterical tears and call my husband. He answered and didn't say anything. I unload on him about being betrayed by the person I trust the most in the world and ask where the hell the money went. He said he was under a lot of stress with the kids (I am a SAHM and do EVERYTHING) so he wanted to treat himself and bought a computer for his office. 

I told him not to come home and he hasn't yet.The thing is, he is an excellent daddy and husband and this is very out of the blue. It has made me so upset that I texted him I wanted a divorce since I seem to not matter. He texted me back saying no divorce but it was his money anyway. This has damaged us to a level I never thought we could get to.

My MIL called me and told me to kick him out but my own family (especially mother) is saying she's very disappointed in me and thinks I am vain and shallow. I just want to look normal and play with my babies with no pain 

AITA?

Edit to add: he said he thought I didn't want it anymore since I haven't talked about it in a few months and he thought I'd never realize. And he has seen me struggle with the pain for years and has taken me to every therapy appointment. 

Also the money wan transferred to his sole account (I have one too, for ""fun money"". We transfer the equal amounts to each of us when we can). I cannot see the transactions after the transfer

The money is sitting in my account atill and i will move it back tomorrow morning as soon as i can. We talked about the recovery time for surgey and the time I needed to take off to watch the kids and run the house. It has made me panic a great deal so I moved it thinking you wouldn't mind me spending it and we just save up again. I did it out of panic and frustrations and did not expect you to find out so soon.

Rest and I will fix it all tomorrow i promise you.  You will have the surgery you wanted. I am a selfish stupid man and I hope you can forgive me""

AITA for telling the flight attendant to ask the woman in front of me to raise her seat up because it was pressing on my legs?,"I was recently on a long (3+ hour) flight.  When we got airborne, the woman in front of me reclined her seat back, pressing them down on my kneecaps.  I am a tall person (6'5"") and generally don't fit into coach seats easily. I couldn't even put my tray down.  Leaning my seat back doesn't really help. I wrangled myself out of my seat and asked her politely, ""I'm sorry ma'am, but I wonder if I could impose on you and ask to please raise your seat up just a few inches?  I don't have much space back there and with your seat pressing on my kneecaps, neither of us will be very comfortable during this long flight.  Thank you.""  She just looked at me blankly, said ""No"", and closed her eyes.  I walked to the front of the plane and explained my situation to the flight attendant, who went back and spoke to the woman, who then reluctantly raised the seat up a bit.  When I got back into my seat, the woman turned around and hissed ""Asshole"" at me.

AITA (or I guess are we) for making a family that is tresspassing on my property uncomfortable,"26m. My boyfriend and I live in a lake house. I have two brothers and our father hasn’t been in the picture since I was 15 so and my BFs father left him and his mom when he was really young. 

My brothers are 24 and 21. The 24 year old has a GF who I think is 23. My brothers and the GF came to spend the weekend with us. 

We have lake front property and a little probate beach area. We have signs up that states it is private  property to deter trespassers and cameras that monitor the beach 

This afternoon, we had been taking a break after going on jet ski ride, my youngest brother was helping me cook lunch and my other brother and his GF had decided to go down to the beach. They came back up and told me that there were people on our beach. They had asked them to leave, but they didn’t. 

My BF went down to investigate and apparently there was a whole boat load containing five adults and four kids. He again asked them to leave and told them it was private property. They refused. He called the police and ate lunch as we waited for the police to come. 

Over an hour has gone by and the police hasn’t showed up. He had been planning to go down to beach after lunch so we decided to go down and try and annoy the family into leaving. We played music with explicit lyrics (nothing too bad but still) brought down alcoholic drinks and played drinking games. We purposely and out of character acted rowdy not putting a filter on what we said, my boyfriend and I, who are not ones for PDA, kept holding hands, making out and stuff because there was a good chance this group of people was homophobic (we live in the south). 

After awhile, the group god fed up and left, before the group left one of the women yelled at us “shame on you people for ruining what was supposed to be a nice Father’s Day for my husband and brother. We just wanted a good day on the lake and didn’t need to witness frat boys gone wild.” 

I shrugged and said, “I mean this is MY property my family and I can do whatever the fuck we want on it. Next time do as your told and stay the fuck away.” 

The adults in the group look disgusted, one of them men looked like was about to yell at us for what we said but instead they just drove off. 

The police came much later, and obviously weren’t any help. As we discussed what happened My brothers GF mentioned that what we did was immature and kind of rude. And we could have handled it better. Were we the assholes?",Not the A-hole
AITA for giving my sister up for adoption?,"I was adopted when I was 5 years old by a couple who were 28 and 30 at the time. They had no other children. This past year, two things happened. My adoptive father was diagnosed with cancer, and my adoptive mother got pregnant for the first time in decades. My adoptive mother always thought she was infertile, but apparently her ""miracle"" had arrived. She carried on with her pregnancy despite his cancer and her age. She died in childbirth, and my adoptive father followed her two months later. 

Which left me with an infant baby sister and two dead parents. My family is telling me that this is my duty, that I'm not a child or incapable, and of course they're not offering to take her in at all. They've all vehemently refused. Everyone is furious that I ""used"" my adoptive parents' resources, and now that it's time to reciprocate I'm ""taking the easy way out"". They say I'm the right age to have a child anyway, and that it's just like if I had sex and gave birth to her. They've even brought up my fertility reducing medical conditions, and say this is my chance.

This isn't my child. I'm not ready to be a parent. I have graduated college, yes, but I still had dreams. I'm not in a financial, emotional, or mental place to raise a child, even if I kept every penny of the meager inheritance. I'm still single, and I want to be able to date and maybe even marry and have my own family one day. I'll never be able to do anything with this child anchoring me down. 

I consulted with lawyers, and they say I have the right to give this child up for adoption. I'm using an adoption agency. It's an unusual adoption because I'm not attached or related to the child except legally, and I'm also splitting the inheritance 50/50 with my sister and giving it to the adoptive parents for her benefit, so they're gaining money by adopting this child. I picked a couple that my adoptive parents would have approved of, a mid 30s straight religious couple, as opposed to a 25 year old bisexual atheist (me). We've planned for an open adoption with a much more appropriate aunt role for me, and I think it will work out because I obviously don't feel or have a motherly bond.

My family is furious and I'm getting 24/7 calls that I'm selfish, that they'll force me to keep her, and all sorts of empty threats. Am I in the wrong here?

AITA for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?,"Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

My girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

So basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

Well, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

My friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

I don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

My friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?

Please tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. 

TL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

EDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

And to all women, I'm sorry our bathrooms suck. I'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. Tiny bladder club!!",Not the A-hole
AITA for letting my kids reject hugs and kisses from family?,"My two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

My wife and I agreed we wouldn’t force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

Recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to “give Grammy a kiss goodbye” and he said “don’t want to” and we said “that’s fine, wave goodbye then.” And he waved and said goodbye. 

She started to say “oh, no kiss for Grammy?” But I shut that down with “(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings” and we left it at that. She seemed to understand. 

My sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said I was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he “didn’t want to”. 

I tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn’t the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it’s not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn’t treasure her visit. 

We’re about to host thanksgiving and there will be plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son, and in a couple years, from our daughter as well. 

I was ready to stand my ground on this but now my wife and I are less certain after this incident. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA For going off on a lady for calling the cops on me? WIB if I reported her?,"I'm black. My husband is white. He has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who LOVES me, and who I think isn't too bad herself. My niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. We hang out a lot to give my SIL a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

I was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. She was defiant, and I'm all about consequences after two warnings. She kept running from me laughing her butt off, so I told her it was time to go. Normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a GIGANTIC fit so I had to carry her. She wasn't screaming in a ""WHO IS THIS HELP ME"" way but in a clearly understandable ""NO, I WANT TO STAY AND PLAY. AUNTIE(ME), NO"" way. But also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

As we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. I smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. She then got in my face like ""Do you KNOW this child."" I'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so I just said yes and tried to step around her. She then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" I told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""No mother would EVER say that about her kid"". Yeah, maybe. But she can't spell so. She then demanded I give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. 

I was pissed. I told her I don't have to prove anything to her and I'm leaving with my kid. She then literally RAN  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. Cops called. Security guy asks what's up. I was polite to him but I told the lady off. I said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to IMMEDIATELY jump to kidnapping was insane. The cops showed, and they asked my niece who I am ""AUNTIE (ME)!"" and I showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. It's done. 

She  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. I want to report it. She'd been watching us and saw my niece and I hanging for at LEAST 30 minutes familiarly. So while I could have showed her the pictures, I didn't feel like I needed to. It's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. Now, I have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. I'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. I just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""THIS ISN'T MY MOM"" card. And then I really WOULD need the cops to be called because I'd kill her. 

I get she was concerned. And that unlikely I'd adopted a white baby. But also, 100% fuck off, lady. AITA? Would I be if I complained to the facility?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?,"Several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. Before we start, some background about my friend: I've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. He worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. He paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. He recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

On to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. I could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. When we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""At 33 years old I shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""Taking public transportation is for losers"". As someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, I'll admit I took some offense to that. I've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

The real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. Wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. Here's where I may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

After a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. After they left, my wife said I shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and I almost ruined dinner for everyone. My friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

AITA for telling the barista that my girlfriend is with me?,"Basically I'm 25m and she's 23F.

She gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. She cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. She always goes to the same coffee shop. 

Me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. She always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. That was fine. 

Anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

Anyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. I ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and I shit you not he said ""oh is that for Emma?"" And when I looked shocked he went ""I just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". I said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. The guy kinda laughed and i said that I appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, I think he was flirting. He laughed again and said sure thing. 


I didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare I embarrass her like that. This pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! She said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. 
Fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay. 

She stormed out and still won't speak to me without making sly digs.

AITA for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?,"Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. 

I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. 

So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for allowing the girls on my HS track team (I’m the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;,"This is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because I’m honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. I just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that I have to be in his office Monday morning and I’m scared shitless. 

Basically I just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. We have some very talented girls and I enjoy it. 

We were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it’s about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I’m so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn’t long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

Parents are furious with me and obviously it’s gone up the chain. I’m hoping to god I can chalk this up to my inexperience and I’m not fired buf when I had a 6’4” dad screaming in my face that he’s going to get my fired...I’m scared. 

Am I the asshole for allowing this?

Edit: Just as a quick update, in rhe last few minutes I've gotten two texts from parents offering me thier support and willing to show up with me Monday to at the very least talk about how out of line the dad was who screamed in my face, that makes me feel a little better.",Not the A-hole
AITA for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?,"My daughter just turned 6. We had a birthday party for her on Saturday. That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice.

All that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""Sarah"" and it's ""Sara"" and I said, ""who cares, just scrape off the H"" but she insisted on returning it. So I said ""fine whatever."" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags."" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified

""What the fuck is this?"" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her ""It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.

"AITA for using ""peanut repellent"" to stop my sister from stealing my pretzels?","I(17F) am a person who love to snack and have a special addiction on cheese pretzels from a specific bakery. The place is rather far from my place, and since I don't drive, I would spend about an hour and half or so on bus to and fro just to buy them once in a while.


My younger(13F) sister loves them too, and she is always too lazy and stingy to buy for herself that she would steal from me. When she does steal, she would take the whole box of 6 and finish them before I realized they are missing. Whenever I confront her, she would laugh and say that I don't need all that since I am so fat. Yes, I do have a decent amount of chubs, but that's my business, not her's.


After quite a while of failing to hide the pretzels, shouting match between me and my sister, complaining to mum who doesn't give a damn and agree that I don't need extra fats, I have started using another way, ""Peanut Repellent"" I call it.


You see, my sister is mildly allergic to peanuts. She had accidentaly ingested them a couple of times in the past, she looked nasty for a while but nothing serious happened otherwise. Still, it was enough for her to make an effort to avoid eating peanuts.


I bought some breadcrumbs and would now sprinkle them on top of my pretzels in front of my sister whenever I buy them, announcing to her that they are peanut crumbs, so that she would stop stealing them anymore. She did stop. 


My sister has been calling me selfish pig and my mother demanded me to stop as I am putting my greed over my sister's safety, to which I replied that she would be in no such danger if she keep her hands and mouth to herself. AITA for using the ""peanut repellent""?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not explaining straight away about how I lost my leg?,"I am (24M)

In the summer of 2016, I was driving pretty late at night. There wasn’t anybody around so I was enjoying the peace and quiet. Then, out of nowhere, this speeding car hit me and I remember hearing a loud screech and seeing black. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital and I’m told I was in a horrific car crash. Basically, another driver had been drunk driving and was speeding and slammed straight into the driver side of the car. My lower body was crushed and I had broken all the major bones in my lower right leg beyond repair and that my leg had been immediately amputated from the knee whilst I was unconscious. I also had breaks in other parts of me, open bleeding wound and even some burn wounds as part of the car had been leaking and caught fire. All in all, I was pretty lucky to be alive as I should have died.

Anyway, I had a long recovery. I was in hospital for months and also had to learn to walk again with a fake leg. When I eventually did heal, I was left with some noticeable burn scars, normal scars due to the crash and quite glaringly a missing leg. The crash had a profound effect on me as I was only 20 and it destroyed my relationship with my then girlfriend and my mental health. It took me a long time to feel comfortable being an amputee and I decided to get into the dating game. My friends helped me and I have currently been talking to someone for the past few weeks and we’ve been able to meet a couple of times. She knows I’m missing a leg but I never explained why as I didn’t really know her and it was an insanely personal thing to open up about. 

I finally told her what happened to me last night and explained that it’s not something that’s easy for me to talk about and how I’m pretty scarred both physically and mentally from it. I kinda thought she’d get it but she got really angry with me. She said that I’m an AH as I clearly don’t trust her enough to open up about my past to her, especially something as huge as the crash as it’s pretty visible I only have one leg. I tried to reason with her and say that it’s only been a few weeks but I just made things worse.

I do really like her and I think maybe I could have said something earlier so I can see why she felt a little hurt but I also believe that sometimes huge things take time to come out so idk. AITA?

Update: thought it was clear enough but the guy who hit me was driving drunk not me. I was sober.

Update 2: a lot of people have said this is a red flag so tbh I’m considering asking to meet her again and explain that her behaviour was now I realise not okay and that I’m considering things between us. If it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be.

Update 3; I read a lot of comments basically saying I deserved better and fuck it, after a few hours of thinking ,you’re right. I asked to meet her again and I plan on telling her to her face I don’t see us going anywhere.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not specifying my medical condition to my SO?,"I (F31) met my boyfriend N. (M33) about a year ago. Few years ago I developed a medical condition which was treated by hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). This of course caused me to be completely unable to have my own children. 

Few weeks after I met N. I told him that I'm infertile, knowing that at our age this is important information and may be a deal breaker. He reacted pretty sweet, he told me that it's okay and he doesn't think of me less because of that. I asked him if he didn't mind never having children with me and he said we'll deal with that when the time comes. 

I think that was the moment when I should have corrected him or say anything, because there is nothing to deal with. By I thought to myself that maybe he meant adoption or something. 

The next time when I think I should've say something was when few months later his friend informed us that he and his fiance are expecting a child. They had some difficulties and apparently it took them several years to succeed. N. said that night: ""You see? The doctor told them they couldn't have children too and look, here they are! Miracle babies happen all the time!"". I just said something like ""Good for them."" and changed the topic. 

Two weeks ago he moved in with me. As we unpacked his stuff he said ""Okay, now we can start looking for some therapies for you. I managed to save some money, we can deal with that now"". I asked him WTF is he planning to deal with. He said, with my alegged infertility. I asked him again WTF does he mean ""alleged""? He said ""You know, like my friends, they were also supposed to be infertile and now they have a newborn at home"". I replied saying that I'm happy for them, but every case is different and in my case it's completely not possible because I don't have any uterus. He was furious, started to yell that I should have told him that in the first place, that I mislead him. From my point of view I told him enough and he is adult so he made conscious decision to stay with me. We fight about it ever since. 

So AITA for not telling him exactly what condition makes me sterile?

AITA for refusing to let my sister play with our Switch after she failed to make payments on it?,"Basically my sister (14F) and I (20F) wanted a Nintendo Switch, but it costs a lot of money to get one so we decided to split the cost. Overall the switch + games + accessories cost about $420 (ayyy) and as I have a job and I’m older, I agreed to paying for most of it ($300).

We gave ourselves about 3 months to save up money, but by the end of it, my sister didn’t have enough for her $120 share (she was always spending money and hanging out with her friends.)

But I still wanted a Switch so I said I would cover her as long as she paid me back via artwork and drawings. She’s a great artist and she does do commissions, so we agreed that I would pay for her and in exchange, she would create 3-4 drawings for me.

So we bought the switch back in January and we both use it. Anyhow, I asked her to draw me a portrait of my friend for her birthday, nothing too strenuous, asked her 3 weeks in advance and gave her all the info she needed. She never delivered and i was angry, but I just bought my friend another present last minute so I wasn’t too upset.

Anyhow fast forward to February and she did the same thing. Then more recently, I asked if she could draw a character I liked from a TV show and she just straight up told me that she didn’t want to, that she never wanted to, that she didn’t know why I kept asking her to draw shit and that I was not entitled to her drawings.

I reminded her that her drawing for me was literally apart of the deal we had on the Nintendo switch but she said it’s been months since we got it so we should just drop it.

So I did just that and now I’m refusing to let her play the switch, of course she’s angry but I said it was technically my Switch now since I paid for it 100%. I brought it up to my mom and she said I need to be the bigger person here (figuratively and literally) and share it with my sister. AITA in this situation?

# EDIT AND UPDATE:

When I went to bed, this post had like 30 comments and there was no new ones coming in so I was sure it'd be dead. SUPER surprised to see 1K+ comments when I woke up! There's a lot of concerns I would like to address in the comments section but the only one I want to address is that I'm a college student who pays for my own rent, car payments, car insurance, my priority is putting money in my ROTH and 401K etc. so it DOES take me a while to save up to buy games. 

Anyhow, she actually came knocking on my door after lunch and apologized to me. She said her actions were unnecessary and she was mortified about how immature she acted. I kind of lectured her on financial responsibility and she took it very well actually! We started a change jar so she could save up, even if only a little bit at a time. We negotiated and I said the 3-4 drawing offer still stands, but I won't let her play with it until she creates at least one, and that I want the other three drawings done by the end of this year. So now she's drawing Haley from Stardew Valley. Some people are going to say I'm too lenient, but in the long run it's probably better off like this.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not being attracted to my girlfriend’s body?,"I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
I’m also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I’ll try to keep it as PG as I can.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
I will say that she’s the first thin person I’ve ever been with. She’s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I’ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I’ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She’s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she’s not attractive if she doesn’t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.
I told her I had to be honest, and said that I’m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It’s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I’m being honest, that’s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we’ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn’t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).

Am I being the asshole here?

"AITA for not reminding my husband about holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc?","My MIL's birthday was about two months ago. They live on the other side of the country, so it would typically mean a phonecall and maybe a birthday card. Well, I guess my husband forgot about it and didn't call her or send her a card.

I found this out because she called and was disappointed that she didn't hear anything from us. I told her that my husband probably should have put her birthday in his calendar and set a reminder, and that he never does.

She asked me why I didn't keep track of this stuff for him, because ""he's a guy, they don't care about that stuff."" She mentioned he'd skipped his sister's birthday and niece's and nephew's birthdays too, and that I should start trying to remind him. And then she said ""And don't forget Mother's Day, either.""

I said that she would have to talk to him about this, and it didn't sit well with her. She got annoyed and told me that like it or not, it's kind of ""my job"" to keep track of this stuff, because again, guys don't care. I said ""Well, if he doesn't care, he doesn't care. I'm not his mom.""

She ended up talking to him about it, and he got pretty annoyed with me for not reminding him about this stuff and that he just doesn't remember this kind of stuff. He said that we're a team and that he's obviously not good at this, so I should step up.

I asked him what the release date for a video game he'd been talking about was. He said the exact date. I just looked at him for a minute, and he got pretty defensive and said ""That's totally different.""

Then I said we would make a calendar together that we both had on our phones so we would get reminders for important dates. He agreed. So I started the calendar, entered in my dates, and it has been sitting there, unused for the past two months. What happened? He missed another birthday, and the whole thing started again.

**Edit:** So I don't have to keep saying this over and over, I had no idea when his mom's birthday was. She's not *my* mom, and I have never celebrated her birthday before, so I am not sure why I would ever know that. Same with the others in his family. This is why a shared calendar was the big solution I came up with. I can't celebrate something if I don't know when it is. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for being upset about my wife selling her engagement ring?,"I got engaged to my wife when we were 26, we had been dating for 7 years.

I got her engagement ring engraved to say “Semper amemus” which means let us always love, I spent all my savings on her engagement ring and even took a loan out to buy it, it seems silly now but I love her and she deserves the best.


We got married at 30, adopted our first child at 32, second child at 35 and now we’re both 40.

I recently found out she pawned her engagement ring for £1,200, I spent over nine thousand on her ring.


She’s telling me she’s got a bunch of pictures of it and she isn’t a jewellery person anyway which is true in all the years I’ve known her she’s only worn her crucifix and engagement/wedding ring, the wedding ring means everything to her but she doesn’t have any attachment to the engagement ring.

I’m completely upset about that 

She thinks I’m an AH because it was *her* ring after all and it didn’t mean as much to her as it did to me

AITA for quitting on my friend because she won the lottery?,"I've been the sole babysitter for a friend since their child was born 3 years ago. I don't get paid supremely well, below minimum wage ($60/6hr when minimum would be $84/6hr) but it's still been agreeable because it's easy money and I can study while I'm there. My friend is also not particularly well off (or wasn't as you'll soon read) so I was throwing them a bone by being lenient on the wage. The husband is against babysitting and daycares (he was a victim of abuse this way) but he agreed because we're all friends and have been for a long time.

My friend won $740,000 in the lottery two months ago and everything is more or less settled in. They bought two new 2019 cars ($60,000+ vehicles), travelled a bit, etc. But they still paid me the same amount, which stung because I'm covering for them while they went to Cuba and Mexico.

They can afford to pay me more, so I told them this. I want minimum wage, and they declined saying it's too expensive. So I decided to no longer babysit for them. This means they'll have no babysitter because my friend's husband doesn't care for them.

I know I'm not the asshole for quitting over a wage but it's not entirely that. I'm half doing this vindictively because I know they're in a peculiar position where I'm their only option. But all I want is minimum wage, I'm not going to gouge them over this fact. Part of it might be jealousy but if they can afford $120,000+ in cars in the span of two months, they can afford an extra $24 per shift of my babysitting.

AITA for not making my daughter share her lottery winnings with her stepsister?,"



Even though she’s under 18 for holidays I always get my daughter a couple of scratchers that I will cash for her. My dad used to do the same for me and it was fun even if I didn’t win. The only rules I made about them are anything over a hundred dollars goes into a savings account for when she’s older.

I decided to give my stepdaughter some lottery tickets too. I had asked my wife about it beforehand and she was going to have the same rules with the money except she would be the one to hold onto anything over a hundred for her daughter since we keep our finances mostly separate.

My stepdaughter scratched hers and won $10. My daughter scratched hers and won $300. So I cashed them in and gave my daughter $100 and my stepdaughter the $10. 

My stepdaughter was disappointed and my wife thinks I should have split up the money evenly so each of the girls got at least $55 to spend and $100 to save since the ticket and money were technically mine legally.

I don’t think splitting up my daughters money would have been fair to her. I certainly wouldn’t have made my stepdaughter to give mine any of her winnings if she won more.

Edit. Messed up on math. After taking out the $200 and splitting it up they  would get $55 spend.

Edit 2. A lot of people seem to have missed the part where I explained the rule I had about them, so I’ll repeat it. I am not keeping any of the money for myself. The $200 I didn’t give my daughter went into her savings account that she can use when she’s older.

Edit 3. They’re $1 scratchers. The grand prize is under $1000. So no need to worry about one of them winning thousands or millions.

Edit 4. The scratchers were a small side present. They both got lots of other presents too more suited to their interests.",Not the A-hole
AITA for legally changing my name and refusing to speak to my mother,"Growing up, my mother had a horrible habit of trying to one-up my Aunt Terra. She did everything from dying her hair like my aunt, making our living room a replica of her's, and getting better versions of her pets. My Mom was the ""pretty sister"" growing up, married ""better"" and had ""better kids.""

This caused huge resentment for my siblings and I. Everything we did was thrown into our cousin's faces. This led to us not speaking to my mother that often and refusing to go to see our Aunt Terra. I was close with my cousins \[we went to the same school\] but I hated when my mom was around.

What made it even more awkward was the fact my mom stole my aunt terra's names.

My oldest brother is Martin and a year younger than cousin Martina. I am named for my cousin Rebecca \[I'm Becca\] and we are six months apart.

I started going by Eve \[short for my middle name Evelyn\] when I was 13. My Mom refused to call me anything but Becca. But my whole family was more than happy to call me whatever I wanted. My brother went by his middle name as well.

I turned 18 and my dad paid for the legal name change. I am now Evelyn Surname.

My mom threw a fit and threatened to never speak to me again. I took her up on that offer and stopped contact. My dad has since divorced her and at 25 I have not spoken to her in *years.* She has reached out to me and said she was in therapy, had started medication for bipolar, and she wants me in her life.

I was almost tempted but she ended the message with ""I miss my Becca.""

I told her she had the wrong person, there was no Becca here. I told her when she wanted to speak to Eve I would be here. She has not reached out since.

AITA for calling my angry neighbor out in front of her family?,"I moved into an apartment on the ground floor of a house which is split up into three apartments. The house next door is owned by a couple with several kids.

The woman who lives there has a temper... A few times, when I've been hanging out with friends in the back yard, she's yelled at us over stuff. Playing music with cusses where her kids can hear, being too ""slutty"" with each other, which was awkward because we were not doing anything sexual... Other stuff that's too ugly to repeat here... Etc.

As far as I can tell she never does this in front of her husband or kids. Her husband isn't home often, it seems. 

Then, a while later, I was out getting my mail when four people walked by, the neighbor lady, her husband, and two older people who I think were either her parents or her husband's parents.

The husband asked me if I knew there was water leaking from the hose in the front yard of my house. He seemed friendly and like he was trying to be helpful.

I said I hadn't known, maybe the maintenance guy left it on.

But then I got a really weird feeling about how the woman that has said so much nasty stuff was standing with her family acting really chill in front of them.

I said ""Hey, excuse me, aren't you the lady who's called my friends and I sluts, (homophobic slur), and (c-words) ? I was hoping to talk to you at a calmer moment.

She said no right away.

I then, knowing full well that she was that lady, said ""Oh sorry, perhaps I'm confused. There's a lady who lives in that house, mid 40s, heavyset with chin length brown hair, smokes out back every night, who's said all those things and more, and I really don't appreciate it. Do you have a sister? A roommate?""

She cut me off and said maybe it's better I leave, and so I did. I heard fighting from that house that night and I think it was because of what I said, her husband and the older couple seemed shocked by some of it.

AITA for getting mad at my mom for continuously forgetting about my gf's allergy?,"Hi everyone.

My girlfriend and I have been together nearly 2 years now and have spent a bunch of get togethers with my family in that time. From the beginning, I told my parents that my girlfriend has a serious pork allergy. Whenever a family occasion comes up that involves them cooking, I always remind them about the allergy because they always seem to forget (and my family seems to eat a lot of pork, go figure). Last year at Christmas, my mom cooked the turkey with bacon layered on the top of it despite knowing about my girlfriend's allergy, and my girlfriend couldn't eat it.

So, since the holidays are coming up I reminded my mom a few weeks ago about the allergy. Today at lunch I was talking to my mom and brought up Christmas Day. She then says, ""I'm cooking the turkey with bacon on top"". I just looked at her and said ""If you do that, (insert girlfriend's name) won't be able to eat it like last year"". Then she got all upset and says ""Fine, I just won't cook it with bacon like I had planned then"" and I said, ""You don't have to do a whole separate plan"" and she got pissed off and said ""Good  I won't."" She then asked if my girlfriend can eat ham and I just looked at her incredulously and reminded her that no, she can't, because ham is also pork. She just huffed at that and walked away from the table and didn't sit down again.

I feel hurt because I feel like there's an inconsiderate aspect to this by both of my parents not keeping in mind my girlfriend's allergy and me having to continually remind them. I'm mad because if I hadn't said anything today, the turkey would have again been cooked with bacon on it and my girlfriend wouldn't have been able to eat it, which I personally would find upsetting if I were in her shoes and it happened for a second year in a row.

AITA for posting a video of the mayor of my town driving like an idiot to YouTube?,"
I have a dashcam and sometimes I upload videos of dumb shit I see to YouTube. 

Anyway, I was driving home from work a few days ago and saw a really expensive Audi cut across three lanes in one move, and cut into the exit lane I was in, barely squeezing in between me and the start of the barrier. I slammed the brakes, and there wasn't any accident but it shook me up. It was the closest call I've ever had.

The driver pulled off into a gas station and I pulled over by the side of the road so I could turn my dashcam and get a clear video of the driver's face as he pumped gas, so I could confirm his identity. I had been wanting to make a report for reckless driving because the guy had almost caused a really bad accident.

I had never reported something before, but this was probably the scariest close call I'd ever had and I thought it would be a good idea to.

I reported it to the police non emergency line, and they said they'd get back to me but I didn't hear anything yet.  I also put the video on YouTube titled ""crazy Audi driver in HomeTownName"" 

Anyway, a few days later, someone commented on the video saying that was the mayor. I didn't believe it at first but then I looked up pictures of him, and was certian. It was definitely the same guy, he'd even been photographed by a local reporter near his Audi.

I edited the video title and description and said that it was the mayor of the town! And I guess because it's such a small town and the video got shared around, it's one of the earlier results if you look this guy up. It's apparently gotten shared in some Facebook groups like a local mother's group, and a community group, and the guy is getting a lot of shit for it. I didn't see the reposts myself, I'm not on Facebook.

But I got a call from one. of the mayor's employees asking me to take the video down. I said I'd like to talk to the guy, like I wanted to just have a chat with the person who nearly killled me, and then wouldn't even call me himself to apologise? And she got really defensive but also formal like ""I'm afraid that isn't possible at the moment"" 

Anyway, some of my coworkers think it was kinda shitty of me to follow the guy, film him, and put his name on the internet. And I guess I get that; but I also feel like as a public figure and a representative this guy should be held to a higher standard.

AITA for thinking the school or the other Parent show pay for new epipens?,"On Friday a student at my daughters school had a severe allergic reaction. The kids parent never brought in a new epipen after an old one expired and the school didn’t have any of their own so they used my daughters pens. Both of them. Now I’m not upset they used them. It may have saved the kids life. I’m glad the kid is okay. 
Today when I went to drop off new ones for the school and I asked the school for contact information of the parent so I can get reimbursed for the new pens. They told me they couldn’t give me that information and refused to even contact the parent for me. So I produce the receipt and said OK you can reimburse me for it as my Insurance would only pay once a year for them, I do it every January and I had to get these out of pocket. The woman acted like I had aborted a baby in front of her. She refused saying that the school isn’t liable for the use of the EpiPens. 
I make okay money but these damn things are not cheap, 650$, and that’s still a lot of money for us. I’m glad that it was used to save a kids life but I really do feel as if I should be reimbursed. But I was made to feel like a worthless asshole. 
I spoke to the principal of the school and... well I was a little more short that I should have been after the secretary was such a bitch and he’s going to talk to the school board. Currently they’ve never had this happen before and they don’t know how to proceed. It cost me 650$ to replace the set. 

So AITA for wanting someone to repay me for a life saving drug that was used on another child?

Edit: Thanks. I really do feel better. The office staff and principal seemed like I was the worse person in the world. I normally don’t care to much what people think but those stares. They really got to me.

Edit 2: So I just got off the phone with the school’s superintendent. She apologized. It turns out that the school did in fact have epipens on campus but the person in question didn’t know the location of the emergency box, another issue, and used my child’s pens. She said that they would be doing mandatory retraining for all staff and personnel. They would also be reimbursing me the cost. It would take about a week. She also apologize for the rudeness of the staff at the school this morning and that they didn’t follow protocol last week on Friday about informing me that my daughter didn’t have an epipen any longer. 
In short I wasn’t being an asshole after all and the office staff was for whatever reason. Maybe they were scared that me asking questions would lead to something. I don’t know. I just want to thank all of you. Especially those that gave me information on the generic forms of this drug. I’m going to talk to my daughters doctor about it as in the past I was told there wasn’t a generic. This will really help us save because the damn things are so costly and I make just enough that I don’t qualify for any of the programs to help lower the cost.

AITA for telling a girl at the gym that her pants are see through?,"My gym has multiple squat racks facing mirrors opposite each other. This means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  Because it might help with context I’m 6’, 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

While in between sets, I’m standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when I see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that I can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

Like 90% of people in the gym I just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn’t exist.  So I move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and I can pretty much see her butthole.  I don’t mean if I squint and stare, I mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

No idea why I cared (am married and completely uninterested) but I go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

“Hey this is super creepy, but I’d feel creepier if I didn’t say something.  When you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.”

Again I thought I was being helpful and that she’d want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. This girl practically screams “You fucking pervert! Stop staring at my ass!” 

Not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, I go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.

AITA for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?,"Edit 1: Wow, thank you all so much for you input. I will post an update in a day or so

Edit 2: PLEASE STOP GIVING ME AWARDS THIS IS A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE DANK MEMES

The title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

My fiance and I are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, Summer 2021.

I make pretty good money for my age. In fact, I make more money than any of my friends or family, and I would bet I'm in the ""1%"" of my community. I try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. I should also add when we started dating, I was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

My fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. She was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  Since then, she hasn't worked. I really didn't mind at all. I make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

I am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead I just would venmo her some cash weekly. It was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

She has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. I know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  She has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

I shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

I told her I would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so I could see exactly what she was spending it on. I could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but I hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

She blew up. Telling me I wasn't trusting her and how I was the one against joint bank accounts so I should understand her privacy. Yeah, HUGE red flags all over the place.

I talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying I was not respecting her privacy when I'm the one that demands it also.

AITA for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?,"Hi everyone, I’d like some input. 

My wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we’d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she’d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she’s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. 

The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said “oh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.” Then she showed a few to me. 

They were those “Earn 0.07$ a gallon” receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn’t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

I’m so disgusted guys. I can’t believe she did this. I don’t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I’m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?

Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I’ve worked in for 15 years. I’m on disability through my employer but it isn’t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don’t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can’t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I’m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",Asshole
"AITA for calling the police on the parents that left me to babysit their toddlers without my consent, and telling them I will no longer babysit their kids anymore?","I'm VERY late on this, sorry.

I'm an 18 year old guy with a lot of experience when it comes to handling kids. I've babysat my baby brother multiple times when I was 14-15, and even some of my cousins aged around 3-8 (where I live it's not illegal to do, so don't worry). I do this when I'm free on the weeked.

My town's pretty small and the people there are very busy sometimes. Combine that with the fact that there aren't many babysitters and well, news spread (via my mum who wanted me to do this) that I'm a good option.

I voluntarily do my services for cheap, (I'll use the currency dollars to put it into perspective for most of you) approximately $2-3/hour, sometimes even for free. The parents/carers are always so surprised and amazed when they arrive back to see everything in perfect condition, and even more so when I tell them the price. They often offer more but I reject, because I just enjoy working with kids.

This one family took advantage of this though. I live alone with a few roommates, so this family I previously served multiple times called me and felt that they owed me a special Thanksgiving dinner because it was the least that they could do.

I don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but I didn't want to be rude to their kind offer and decided that I would go. I drove there and we were having a good time eating and talking. My parents called to check on me so I excused myself to leave the room and go on a quick call with them and left. They must seen this as an opportunity of some sort, because the next thing you know they left quickly and left a note on the table saying ""Sorry! We'll be right back and pay you in full."", and left me with a 4 year old boy and 3 year old girl.

It was late and I had plans to enjoy my Thanksgiving holiday and they ruined it. I obviously wasn't happy so I tried calling them 3 times but they didn't pick up. I dialled the non-emergency police number and when the officer showed up, I told him everything.

The parents turned up and the officer demanded their side of the story. They told him they had to attend an emergency community meeting. They were lucky not to get fined, but the officer gave them a strong reprimanding and left. They were confused and ticked off at me. I said ""you should have let me know and you practically left your kids with me without my consent. That's illegal""

I then told them ""don't expect me to babysit your kids here on out"". They've tried to call me numerous times that they need me and they apologise, but I wasn't having any of it. I told my parents and they thought I was being a little too harsh.

**EDIT**: A LOT of you guys are confused at my contradictive phrasing. **I don't celebrate Thanksgiving**, but you can still celebrate the holiday with your own plans instead without actually celebrating the event. I know some non-Christian friends who decided to go on a vacation to France during the Christmas holidays, that doesn't necessarily mean that they ""celebrate Christmas"". It's just taking a break from all the stuff you usually do and having fun. If I'm making sense.

**EDIT 2:** You guys are right. I ought to charge more. It seems like I undervalue my work and I don't. But with charge rates like that, it's very easy to be taken advantage of. Thank you for all of your insights on this.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making Gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?,"So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

I've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

Well, it didn't stop. 

Anyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

The noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH! followed by snorts and the like.

So far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. His audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor Gargoyle rears its ugly head.

I enjoy babysitting, love kids, etc - why not?"" My mother took me over to Jane's house, introduced herself, gave Jane her number and left once she saw that there were actually kids there, that Jane and her husband Peter were getting ready to leave, that it was legit basically. 

Jane and Peter left and I babysit the kids who were cool kids. I watch a movie, clean up the mess we had made in the kitchen (spaghetti with toddlers is a nightmare!) and chill on my phone. Nothing I do on my phone while I am at Jane's is anything near 'inappropriate'. I do have a lockable folder with some inappropriate things on there (aka anime and manga that are definitely NOT G rated) but don't touch that folder at all while I'm there. 

Jane comes home at 10pm, checks on the kids, checks out the house and as I'm waiting to be paid, she turns to me and says ""before I pay you - I need to look at your phone. I want to make sure that you didn't take photos of my house or my kids or look at anything rude"". I ask her whether she means she wants to look at my Iphone's camera roll and she shakes her head. ""No, I want to quickly check your facebook, your messages and whatever other apps you have to double check"". 

I obviously say 'no' and Jane tells me that she will not be paying me. I call my mother and she quickly comes down. She looks at my phone herself, tells Jane there is nothing on there concerning her and to pay me now please. Jane pays me and informs me I will not be asked back and that she will be telling Kate that I was ""not a good babysitter!"". My mother replies that she will be also talking to Kate about her choice of 'good friends' and we leave.

AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?,"tl;dr at bottom

Okay so I’m almost 19.

When my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. They got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn’t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it’s weird they never told their daughters, given that they’re all such protestors against abortion.

But anyways dad also has a sister, who’s daughter I’m really close with. She’s Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it. I absolutely adore her baby, and I try to help raise him given that he doesn’t have a father.

I’m usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle’s daughters, and I was messaging them three way last night. I was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why I would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

I told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. But they overrode me, saying that she’s easy and shouldn’t have spread her legs blah blah blah. It went on for a few more messages.

I got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

“Yeah I hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. Everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.”

Three hours later and there was still no response; I knew I was in deep shit.

And I was! My parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning I’m using my old old old phone right now. They were very tense with me today. I was very earnest. 

I always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus I ask, AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?

tl;dr: uncle and aunt got abortion way back when, told unbeknownst cousins about it when they judged our cousin for having baby out of wedlock, parents mad at me. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my STB ex-husband he will not be allowed in the birthing room?,"I(30f) am 30 weeks pregnant with mine and my STB ex husband's(31m) daughter. She will be my first child but it turns out she won't be his first child. He's been carrying on an affair that started several years ago during my residency in internal medicine and cardiology. His excuse was I was working long hours and not emotionally available so I ""drove"" him to it. I found out about the affair because the woman with their child came to our home 2 months ago demanding I release him from our financially abusive and loveless marriage. 

I guess you could say I ambushed him because I called him and told him he needed to come home. When he did and he saw her I knew based upon his reaction he had been cheating. So I kicked him and all his stuff out of the house. In my book, I granted his wish. He has asked for another shot that we go to marriage counseling but he has had years to come clean and didn't so I am unwilling to attempt reconciliation. 

He's been calling and leaving messages at home, my cellphone, as well as the hospital where I work asking if he could be with me when I go into labor. I've told him in no uncertain terms will he be allowed in or anywhere near my birthing room. I want people in there that I trust and he isn't it. He's been guilt-tripping me though saying he has a right to see his child be born. That his fuck up is separate from our daughter, and it is but I don't want the added stress of him being present.

His family and he all think I'm the AH and already alienating him from his child. My family and most friends support me, however, there are a few who think I'm being an AH here. Maybe I am because of the hurt he has caused me.

TL:DR found out STB ex-husband has been cheating for years and I've banned him from the birthing room.

Edit: for those worrying about alimony we have a prenup in place which by him cheating he is in full violation of. He is therefore not entitled to any alimony. 

He is on his own a mechanical engineer and though he doesn't make nearly as much as I do as a cardiologist he can more than afford to take care of himself financially without my help.

Edit: we do not live in the US for those wondering. I graduated secondary (or HS) at 16, completed uni (or college) at 20, finished medical school at 24, and completed my residency at 28. My country does not require doctors to enter fellowship programs. 

Edit: let me make this perfectly clear as it has continuously come up. I will NOT under any circumstances keep him from having a relationship with his daughter. I am completely agreeable to shared custody, and to him seeing her after she has been born.",Not the A-hole
AITA for reading my teenage daughters diary?,"I (m35) have a 16 year old daughter. I’ve been a single father since she was about 3 years old as I got sole legal custody due to some addiction issues her mother has. We have a really good relationship, but I always worry about her not having a woman to talk to. 

Over the past few months she hasn’t really seemed to be herself, I know she went through a bad break up but I’ve been worried it’s more than that. I’ve tried talking to her, and my sister only lives down the street so she’s tried talking to her also, but my daughter is really keeping to herself and it concerns me. 

She went out to see her friends for the first time since quarantine started yesterday and asked me if I could give her room a quick tidy whilst she was gone. I agreed because she does a lot of chores but she’s not good at cleaning her room. Whilst I was putting clothes back in her closet, I stumbled upon what I now know to be her diary. 

I shouldn’t have read past the first page but I just wanted to know if there was anything going on she wasn’t telling me about. There were some pretty heartbreaking stuff for a father to read about how down she felt about herself, so when she got home I brought it up to her. 

She asked me why this was suddenly coming up and when I told her I’d read her diary she absolutely flipped and told me it was an absolute violation of privacy and she’s completely humiliated. I told her I was just trying to protect her and she said it was none of my business and locked herself in her bedroom and hasn’t spoken to me since. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for telling my friend she can’t be a Virgin?,"I’m unsure if this is rude and/or ridiculous, so Reddit can be the judge. 

My friend, L, very adamant about saving herself until marriage. (we are both 21F.) It wasn’t even just for her, she would shame and side eye people who weren’t married and sleeping together, even one of our mutual friends. She wholeheartedly believed that was a sin, as she was very religious. 

However, she got boyfriend, and they ended up sleeping together, told me that herself. (Edit: she told me he took her virginity.) One thing led to another and they broke up amicably. 

After that, we were hanging out and she went off on a tangent saying, “girls need to respect themselves and not sleep around, that’s what husbands are for.”

Me: “Does that make you one of those girls?”

L: “What are you talking about?”

Me: “I mean, you had sex.”

I explain that is doesn’t have to be shameful and she can just not do it again until she’s married if she pleases. She seemed to be in disbelief that she’s not a virgin anymore. She also seemed upset that I mentioned that to her. 

I mean we’re 21, I hope she knows what sex is. 

AITA for pointing this out?

EDIT: Oh wow! I didn’t expect this to blow up, haha. I do have one thing to say, when my friend says “sleeps around” also she believes any girl in a relationship that’s having sex is also sleeping around, because she is being unfaithful to her future husband. That was poor wording on my part, I was reusing her words, though. :)",Not the A-hole
AITA for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?,"So I have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when I was 13. I never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

Growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. It's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

I worked with him on and off through college and I've gotten very good at it.

He asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after I graduated. But my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

I do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. He also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

To no one's surprise, my father said I needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

I refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. My father was upset but I guess he figured he couldn't stop me. We continued having weekly dinners.

For some reason, people are liking my company's work more. I have expanded my company more than my father ever has. I also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. I don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless I want to.

Last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. I admit I did feel bad so I offered him a full time job in my company and that I'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. But I told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

This made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. He said I betrayed him. Then I basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

I do feel kind of guilty I ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. But at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

AITA for refusing to take off my heels around my short male cousin.,"Hey reddit! I (then 15F) went to a family celebration last Christmas. It got bought up today on a family zoom call bc we are meeting said cousin and aunt on holiday next month and my aunt seriously told me to forget my heels. So last Christmas, we stayed in a hotel and had a meal where we got dressed up. I wore a black dress with black high heels. I picked the shoes bc I like them and they looked cool with my outfit. I am 5'4 btw, and my cousin 'James' (then 23) is 5'5 / 5'6. With the heels, I was a bit taller than him.

When I came downstairs for food and he saw me in my heels, he was immediately sulky, especially when we took a family photo (in my family, they put the cousins in age order, and he had to stand next to me as I'm the next youngest.) One of my female cousins said my heels looked nice and commented on how tall I looked, and I replied, 'thanks, i really like these shoes, the extra few inches really makes a difference!' James then told his mother (my aunt) that I was making fun of his height   . My aunt then told my dad to tell me to take the heels off, and my dad took me aside and asked me to take off the shoes so I didn't rock the boat. I refused saying 'I'm sorry my shoes are insulting his masculinity. Also, 24 is a bit old to go crying to Mummy.' My dad laughed, but told me to change to my doc martens. I refused.

Cut to my aunt telling me off and pleading with me to change bc 'James is insecure that he's eight years older than you and you're nearly his height, and taller with heels. It's enough that his sister is 5'8.' I sarcastically apologised for my genes, which she didn't appreciate, and told her that he's a bit old for his mum to do his dirty work. She told me to respect my elders (meaning her and my cousin) and I got told off by my grandma for rocking the boat.

I mean, I get respect your elders, and that sarcasm isn't always the right answer but seriously how can you be offended by a shoe? Not to mention that it really irked me that he's 24 and can't even complain to my face, and has to get his mother (who he knows dislikes me for some reason) to tell me off. AITA?

AITA For Getting My Cousin's GF Banned From Family Dinners,"My boyfriend [19M] has been dating me [19F] since we were 14. I am close with my uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents. We get together often to hangout, celebrate holidays, and eating out for birthdays. We eat out like every month together. My boyfriend almost always comes with me. My extended family and him love each other and consider each other family. 


At our dinners, either I pay, my parents pay, or me and my parents both pay partially, for whatever I order. My boyfriend pays for what he orders. Whenever the two of us go on dates we both pay for whatever we order most of the time. We both like this arrangement. We both work and have very close salaries.


My cousin's [32M] girlfriend [33F] has been coming to these dinners for the past two years. However the past year she's been rude and sexist (in my opinion) to my boyfriend. It started with her passively aggressively loudly talking about how guys who are good boyfriends always pay for the girl's order. She also would announce how she's ordering certain expensive items and drinks. She started telling my boyfriend at dinners that he should be paying for me. She got more and more rude about it, telling him he doesn't deserve me. She once went to confront him about it when he went to the bathroom.


I tried talking to my cousin about it but he just says he can't control her behavior. I try defending my boyfriend to her sometimes when she makes these comments but it doesn't stop. So I talked to some family about it and they agreed she was getting really rude. They told my cousin to get her to cut it out but she kept doing it. After she confronted him, my family decided my cousin's gf wasn't welcome to the dinners anymore until she apologizes. My cousin is now furious at me calling me a snitch and saying how unfair it is a ""dumb teen relationship"" is getting priority among our family over their ""adult relationship"". He has been cold to me since. I wasn't setting out to get her banned but this is what my family decided. I love my boyfriend and want him to feel comfortable. I also love my cousin and I know how great it is to have your significant other close with your family.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for “double-reporting” an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?","My husband and I have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is African American and I am white (this will be important later on in the story). My son just got his driver’s permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. The other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

I scolded my son and gave a “sorry” wave to the driver. At the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. His car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. He rolled down the window and shouted the N-word at my son. My son’s face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. The encounter **sickened** me.

I did some research on the company; at one point I even plugged them into Facebook. They have a very active Facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. I called the company and reported the man’s behavior, describing him very vividly. They informed me that they knew exactly who I was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. I had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

Two months later, when I was browsing Facebook kind of boredly one day, the company’s name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it I clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. One of the very first photos/posts I saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. To my horror, I saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. Meaning they didn’t fire him.

The company is part of a nationwide chain, so I called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person I could get to, and I reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn’t fire him. The man I spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person I’d reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. Additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have “no place” and “no future” in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee’s career is now toast.

Was it right of me to “double-report” this guy? I’m sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that I was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. Am I an asshole or a “Karen” for not dropping this matter?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my kid I would help him get a Switch if he can beat Ocarina of Time?,"My 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a Nintendo Switch so he can play BOTW. Right now he has $200 saved up. At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

I know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn’t been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he’s a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He’s been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

Instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I’ll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. 

He jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he’s already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn’t gotten too frustrated yet. He’s only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don’t bother him either. 

But anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I’m a massive dick. That I’m trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he’s already such a good kid. Now I’m having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

AITA for inviting my sons entire class except for one child because of his autism?,"My sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david. 

The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david. 

Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.

AITA for refusing to pay for “my part” of the pizza?,"A few friends and I went out to a party and got drunk. Three of us headed back to sleep at Jamie’s. I was pretty out of it and passed out on the couch. I sort of remember one of them asking me, “Hey OP what do you want on the pizza?” I said “cheese” and went back to sleep.

I woke up and the two large pizzas they ordered were gone. They were like “yeah when they got here you were asleep” and asked me to pay a third since I “helped ordered the pizza.” I was really confused by this and said I was not going to pay third for food they ate. They were like “it’s not our fault you were asleep, you helped order the pizza.” I would be happy to pay for it if I got even one piece the morning after! I asked how the two of them (two small girls) even managed to eat two large pizzas and Sarah was like “well Matthew helped.” Matthew is Jamie’s boyfriend. I said then well Matthew should pay for his part. They got angry and said “you helped order it, we would have gotten something else if you hadn’t.”

AITA for not wanting to be involved with a child I helped conceive?,"I got pregnant in high school, when I was 17 (I am just turning 30 now). I wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. He involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.

I was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. I was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. Delivery was a nightmare. The whole process was so traumatic that I've been diagnosed with PTSD from it, for which I've been in therapy for the last four years.

In my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so I did that. I haven't regretted it for a minute (I do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, I do NOT regret giving up parental rights). I do not think about this child, I do not think of myself as having a child, I am not a mother. I have never met the child and never want to.

Last month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. I told him that we did things according to his wishes and I never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.

He and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought I'd 'come around.' They want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. I won't. Am I the asshole here? All I have done is what I have always said I would do.

Note: Sorry, English isn't my first language. I also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very US-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as I am not from US and we do not have the same type of child support laws.",Not the A-hole
AITA for accusing my brother of replacing my wife’s refrigerated breast milk with cow milk?,"My wife and I had our first baby a month ago. She prefers to pump a few bottles worth of milk at a time and feed the baby from the bottle. She stores the bottles in the fridge. 


My little brother has never had a girlfriend. He acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what I’ve seen. He came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. 


Yesterday, my wife and I, along with our baby, went over to my parent’s house. My brother knows since he’s in our family group chat. He texted me when I was at my parent’s house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. He knows my front door pin to get in. 


When I got home I saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. My wife bottle fed my baby that night with no issues. Today, however, she said the baby reacted very differently to the new bottle she fed her. She coughed much more than usual and spat out the milk, which never happened before. So, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. She told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. That bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.


My wife suspected it was my brother drinking her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. I agreed that it would not be out of character for him to do that. I thought it was a bit fishy he would come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would come to my house when no one was home. 


I called my brother and asked him why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn’t wait a few hours until we got home. He said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall and it was more convenient to drop them off then. I asked him to please tell me the truth if he swapped my wife’s breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently denied it. I told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what a coincidence it must be. He said he really doesn’t know, but I could hear the tremble in his words. I told him that my wife and I don’t believe him and if he doesn’t apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened and ask what they think. He once again denies doing anything so I hung up.

AITA for telling my friend's husband about her secret food stash?,"Background: I have this friend Mandy who I guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" She has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

Recently Mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. Mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

This was about January and Mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and Mandy has actually gained weight. Mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

I was helping Mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge Tupperware bin the back of her suv. I assumed she wanted it unloaded but as I moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. I asked her about it. She got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. I asked her if this why she's gaining weight. She told me to fuck off. I texted her husband because in the heat of the moment I was furious she had spoken to me like that.

Her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so Mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. Mandy is blaming me, am I the asshole here?


Edit: I accept my judgment and I won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and I don't want to he part of this anymore. No I don't want to have sex with him. Nor did I ever imply or infer that. Enjoy your day.


Edit 2: based on some responses that said I was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which I accept) I called and told Mandy that I was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. She said that I am just another person oppressing her and that even the Avengers were oppressing her these days. I asked her what she meant (won’t spoil the movie) but I explained to her that I was acting out of frustration and Avengers is just a movie and now I was really concerned. She said I could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we’re done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. Thank you for participating but I think it’s a dead subject at this point.

"AITA for being annoyed my girlfriend has started dressing ""weird"" recently?","My girlfriend always dressed comfortably and practically until recently; she works at a professional job, and she would usually wear jeans, sneakers, T shirts or sweaters, etc.

About a month ago, she had her friend shave both sides of her head, but leave hair on the top and back of her head. I wasn't a huge fan of it but she said she wanted it for a while, but she was too afraid of being embarrassed if it turned out badly. But now that everyone is working from home, nobody can go out, she took the chance and she loves it.

Then she bleached her brown hair to blonde. Then in a week she dyed it florescent green.

And she was buying a lot of new clothes, crop tops and tank tops, really loud patterned pants, platform sneakers that look like running shoes but have a sole that's like 3 inches tall? Just generally flashy and eccentric stuff. And whenever I ask, she says that this is more her style but she's just been more comfortable getting into it when there's less social pressure.

She's stopped wearing bras and that's also awkward because I can tell she gets stares

I asked what she's going to do when she has to go back to work, and she said she'd dress appropriately but obviously couldn't change her hair. But she didn't think that would be a problem, she'd been practically indespensable during the difficult time the company was having recently, and she couldn't see there being any trouble over hair.

I've said I also don't love her new look, and she's always like ""I don't look that different, like it's still me"" but honestly she does look really different.

We had a fight after I asked her a couple times to just wear normal things when we hang out together, and she got really upset with me over it, saying that she was just trying to have some fun and try something different and it was really rude of me to tell her how to dress

AITA For banning my brother from bringing his indian gf to my wedding?,"Title sounds very bad and horribly racist, but let me clarify:

So my brother (He's 25) has been dating an American-born girl to indian parents since last year (She's 23). Her parents do not like their relationship because he's White and probably prefer her to find an indian man.

He has been trying to gain their approval but failing and from what he said, they continue to shrug him off and actively exclude him if she tries to bring him to her family events. 

This has annoyed me because my brother is one of the nicest people I know. In the mean time, I proposed to my girlfriend and we're sending out invites to everyone. I came to the difficult decision that since his gf's family will not accept him, we will not accept her. I talked it over with my girlfriend and told her how strongly I feel about this and she agreed.

I didn't want to spring this up on her, so I asked his gf if we could meet up and I sat down with her and explained that in good conscious, I could not invite her to our wedding if her family cannot accept my brother and I essentially boiled it down to ""if they don't want my brother, we don't want you."" I told her she will be banned from all of our future family events until something changes with her parents in regards to my brother. 

She got upset about it and this caused a huge divide in my family. My brother obviously is against it but I wanted to do it out of support for him. Other relatives agreed this was the right thing to do, but I've been seeking judgement from outside my family to gain a clearer perspective if I was being an asshole in making this decision?

EDIT: I just want to clarify to all the posters that I am NOT doing this to punish her or her family. She still hangs around her family a lot and given that her family is disrespectful to my brother, I feel that makes her toxic and I do not want toxic people at my wedding. If she disowns her family then she can come",Asshole
AITA for refusing to lie about my husband having a favorite child?,"When I met my husband he had a fifteen year old daughter, who was for the most part easy to get along with though ridiculously spoiled. His daughters mother had some mental issues and he was a single dad for most of her childhood. He said he never wanted kids and she had been a result of birth control failure and that he didn’t want anymore.

I told him that not having kids was a dealbreaker for me and he quickly reconsidered. His daughter was seventeen when our daughter was born and I was shocked at how jealous she was. In general she is not the clingy emotional type but she was furious. He made it his priority to make her feel better and reassure her that she was always going to be the important one. My stepdaughter went to college and thrived and we had another child. She wasn’t even jealous that time but he still made a big production of loving her more.

Right now our kids are 13 and 15 and my stepdaughter is 32, married with kids, and living on her own but it is still pretty clear that he favors her. They talk on the phone almost daily but he has a hard time talking to our daughters because their “too emotional” 

Right now he is visiting his oldest daughter at her beach house and we weren’t invited because she hates our 13 year old. My daughter did go through a phase of being very rude and acting out but we did therapy and discipline and it is under control right now. I said he shouldn’t go see his daughter because it is rude to exclude his wife and kids and he said he doesn’t care if she is rude, she’s still his daughter.

In the past when the kids said something I made excuses for him. We FaceTimed today and my 13 year old made a comment about my stepdaughter being his favorite and I just said I’m sorry honey. When the kids got off the phone he got mad at me for not correcting her but I said I’m not going to lie about it anymore. he has admitted to me in private that she is his favorite but he says it’s not his fault and he can’t control how he feels.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting bf correct a Chinese woman?,"We live in a shared house with a bunch of random Craigslist roommates. One of them is Chinese, and was sitting at the kitchen table during lunch time slurping her noodles and minding her own business. 

My boyfriend had just come into the kitchen to eat his own lunch, and rather than ask her how her weekend was or anything other polite conversation he instead asks her, “Can I teach you something about culture?” 

I *knew* he was going to tell her that Americans consider it rude to slurp food. But this woman wasn’t at a business event; she was in her own house and (in my opinion) can eat her own culture’s food however she damn well pleases, especially since she was sitting alone by herself first and we just happened to enter the same room after.

So I cut my boyfriend off and said, “Stop!” He kept trying to talk to her. “Don’t say anything!” I said again. He kept wanting to press the issue.

Ignoring me, he said, “I don’t care, but Americans think it’s rude to slurp your food.”

“Jeff - stop it! Drop it!” I said, as she looked highly embarrassed and quietly continued eating her meal.

I apologized to her and said, “I apologize for Jeff‘s comment.” And he said, “And I apologize for my girlfriend not letting me talk to you.”

I don’t think it’s Jeff’s place to “educate“ people who ***didn’t ask for feedback and were just trying to be comfortable in their own home.*** 

He thinks I’m being a “culturally insensitive, racist liberal” for not letting him “help” teach her American customs.

Who’s being the asshole here?

Edit: By “help” teach her American etiquette, he meant that he wanted to tell her that Americans would find it rude if she slurped her food at a business lunch or such occasion, not that she had to stop doing it at home. 

He worked as a “cultural consultant” abroad, helping foreign business people secure deals with Americans by teaching them about customs and mannerisms and whatnot. So I genuinely believe that Jeff thought he was doing her a favor by letting her know that others might be turned off by slurping. But I still think that 
1) it’s not his place to give such information unsolicited, and
2) the minute you point out that “Americans” find slurping rude, she’s going to feel self-conscious and judged about doing it at home, even if Jeff says it doesn’t bother him.",Not the A-hole
AITA for naming my dog Askim?,"8 years ago I got a gorgeous chug. While extremely high I decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is Askim, because when people ask me his name and I tell them about 50% of the time they’ll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it’s name. It’s hilarious. 
I had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. Occasionally I’ll be chatting to someone that hasn’t met Askim yet and when they ask his name I have my little laugh but other than that it’s a dead joke. 
Well, I just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. An elderly lady asked Askim’s name, said “what?” So I repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. I quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. Since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they “heard about my joke” and that they didn’t appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

I honestly don’t get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog’s dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction I’ll accept your judgement on it.

EDIT: it’s a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, I’ll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

I should have been clearer, but I guess I didn’t know how to spell it out until I saw you guys suggest it. I absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that I made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought I did that intentionally. This is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

The truth is that I say the word “Askim” multiple times a day. I’m aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it’s just a thing I call my dog. When going out I’m not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and I wasn’t trying to trick her, It was small talk and I didn’t even  think about it until I got a negative reaction. 

It’s been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and I know from personal experience that it’s very true. I really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community Facebook page, especially now that I know it’s Turkish meaning and that it’s a town in Norway and neighborhood in Sweden.",Not the A-hole
AITA not caring about or accommodating for my roommate's girlfriend's baby,"I (27F) and my roommate (23M) rent from our landlord (60M) and are both on the lease. Recently my roommate started dating a woman (19F) with a kid (toddler). 

Both the woman and the kid are really annoying. I'm childfree and dislike being around children. This annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. I could deal with this until now. Roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). I am very vocally not happy with this and I told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. It's been a month so I'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

Best thing I can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. I don't acknowledge the kid, I bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, I moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since I hate going out there now anyway. Apart from that business is completely normal. I smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as I do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who I have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as I want during non-quiet hours. I refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. One time I was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. I saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. I lied and said I was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

Roommate's girlfriend HATES me and thinks I'm being selfish. Thinks that the baby needs to come first. She has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks I should be responsible for childproofing the house. I told her to take it up with the landlord and that I wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.

Today I was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that I'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal ""babys should come first, always"". Am I really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house?

AITA for telling my son that I don’t trust his boyfriend,"My son(26M) introduced us to his boyfriend(23M) few years ago. They live together and they’re pretty serious, but me and my husband don’t know anything about him. We see each other often. I just know his age and name. 

He’s financially stable, he owns a huge house, when we asked him where he worked, he just chuckled awkwardly and didn’t answer us. He never answers any questions. 

Recently my son talked to me and said that he wanted to propose to him. I was happy for him of course. I congratulated him. Then we started talking about some stuff. He asked me opinion about him. I told him that I basically don’t know him so I don’t trust him that much, but since he loves him It’s his choice. He got upset at that and left pretty soon. He has been acting distant since that.",Not the A-hole
AITA for praising my son differently than my daughter?,"Throwaway account + obligatory mobile formatting apology.

I (52M) am the father of 3 kids, 15F, 7F, and 7M. The last two are twins and are very close, having the tendency to copy each other. I love and adore them all equally.

My son is not a very masculine kid, and is less interested in some of my hobbies because of this. He has always preferred whatever his mother and older sister did, like baking or dancing. I have no problem with this, I love him as he is, but to be honest, I’m slightly disappointed that we haven’t had the kind of amazing father-son bonding that I got to have with my Grandpa (my Dad died when I was pretty young) when I was a kid.  

Since I’m at home almost all the time now, I’ve been seeing just *how* feminine his interests have gotten. Asking to help cook every meal, helping his older sister alter second-hand clothes, and playing pretend. He’s even asked to have his sister paint his nails. I’m not upset or bothered by it, but it isn’t typical for young boys. 

I’ve been working out at home instead of at the gym because of our current circumstances, and when my son came in while I was lifting weights in the family room, he showed an interest in it. He was excited about the idea of having big muscles, and tried out some of the 5lb ones. Even though he mentioned being like She-Ra (from some new Netflix reboot, I think?), it was still progress in my eyes and it seemed like he was showing interest in masculine hobbies. I praised him and did the whole *”wow, you’re so strong!”* thing in kid-talk to encourage him. 
 
When his sisters walked in, the twin (7F) joined in. Like I said, they have the tendency to want to do what the other is doing so she expected the same kind of “wow, so strong!” stuff. When I wasn’t as enthusiastic with her and focused on my son, my oldest got annoyed and asked why I was treating them differently. I explained to her that because he hadn’t taken interest in these kinds of masculine hobbies before, I wanted to foster his own identity as a boy separate from his twin sister. She accused me of being misogynistic for this! She then said that I was TA for making his sister feel weaker and implying that I didn’t approve of his feminine interests. I don’t think I’m TA, because there’s no reason for my daughter to be inclined towards this kind of thing, but my son should be developing a more masculine personality as he gets older. 

When she told my wife (41F), she also blew up at me, saying I was acting like a cartoon misogynist. Both of them are pissed. So, Reddit, AITA?


|Edit:| Hey everyone. I was 100% TA. I appreciate that some people tried to empathize and say NTA or NAH to be charitable, but I’m in the wrong here and I knew it deep down while I was writing the post. Re-reading it, I feel ridiculous for writing that all out. I want to say thank you, because these comments where the objective kick in the ass I really needed! I realize now that I was really out of line for saying that shit and making my daughters feel that way. I set up a stupid false dichotomy, and my daughter was very right, I was being a misogynist. No excuse for that. I apologized to both of them and my wife an hour after I posted. I also shared this post with my little brother, who, as I mentioned in a comment, was teased for being effeminate as a kid/teen, especially after he came out. I think some people took me mentioning that as blaming him, which wasn’t my intention at all- none of my behavior is his or anybody else’s fault. 

We talked for a while and that (along with many of the comments you guys left!)  made me aware of how badly I’m treating my son. My Grandpa, who raised my brother and I for most of our lives, was a “manly” guy who I’ve always idolized completely. Well, my brother made me aware that my Grandpa in particular made him feel shitty about his femininity and his sexual orientation. He would regularly say degrading, terrible things. I was oblivious to just how much that hurt him, and it seems that I’ve picked up some of these same ideas. I’ve been such a dick for so long, and now that I realize how absurd some of the ideas I’ve held onto are, I know how much of a disservice I’ve done to my boy. I shouldn’t try to make him change just to protect him from bullies. In this situation, I’m the bully as much as it hurts to think. 

I’m planning on talking with him about this issue and apologizing. If we can this week, I want to let him choose something that he likes that we can do together. I’m not going to make the same mistakes my Grandpa did. At my brother’s and some redditors’ suggestions, I’m considering trying out therapy or a support group. After a mistake (huge fuck up) like this, I think I ought to try to be the best dad (and big brother!) I can be and work to stop thinking that way, especially when I’ve already done so much damage. 

I’m sorry about the extremely long edit, but thank you for your responses and helping me with this issue. I showed my wife some comments and she also thanks you all!

|Edit 2|: This will probably be the final update, but wow! I’m overwhelmed will all the responses, I wasn’t expecting so many. Thank you to everyone, I’m glad you guys were honest (but still encouraging!). I’m sorry I haven’t been able to reply to you all. I got a lot of really kind and personal messages and I want you guys to know I’ve taken it to heart.

Some people asked what I’m going to do with my daughters, since it seems like I focused more on my son in the edit. My oldest wants to try Krav Maga, so in the coming weeks we’re hoping to find a place that’ll accommodate both ages. Youngest daughter has wanted to learn how to roller skate too, so my 15 year old may have to teach us both!

I was able to talk to my son for a while this morning and apologize for yesterday. Talking about gender roles and all the trauma surrounding my Grandpa may be something I’ll talk to him more about as he gets older, but I got the message across that I support whatever he’s interested in. I asked him about She-Ra (some commenters told me that it’s fun for adults too) and we watched a few episodes together. You guys were right! My oldest and I both thought it was very cute. I asked him what he would want to do together, and he mentioned trying to alter something. I brought down a box of my old stuff from the attic and lo and behold- I found one of the 80s Hawaiian shirts my grandpa bought me (probably an effort to make me look like Tom Selleck). With some guidance from my oldest, we’re going to try to make it fit my son with room for him to grow into it. I think it’ll turn out nicely, and because it’s “really vintage” my 15 year old loves it. 

So everything is pretty good right now. I invited my brother over (lives a few hours away) for dinner so my son and I can make him something. I can’t believe that I was feeling upset about him liking baking and everything, I’m lucky that my boy wants to help everyone. So, I’m definitely TA, but I’m slowly becoming NTA! Thank you all. I showed my oldest some of my favorite comments and she thinks they’re great and I should expect a “clown of the year” award for a father’s day gift, haha!",Asshole
AITA for refusing to support my son's pregnant girlfriend until she takes a paternity test?,"My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months, and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well. 

She is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own.

Our family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow. 

Since my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the ""best"" in terms of support. 

My son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA?

Edit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath. I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner. 

It's a lot to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to meet my biological daughter ? (I gave up my parental rights years ago),"Many years ago, I was married to man named Mark. 2 years into the marriage, I found out he was cheating on me and got the other woman pregnant. It was a huge blow because I too was pregnant with his child. I was only 9 weeks pregnant and was determined to abort the child and divorce him. He begged me to reconsider, and insisted I give our relationship a second chance, and so I did, albeit reluctantly. 

I had a very unhappy pregnancy and when I was 6 months pregnant, I learned that he never stopped seeing the other woman. He told me that he was torn and that he was in love with both of us. I wasn't willing to tolerate any of that bullshit, so I moved out and filed for divorce. I wanted him to disappear from my life, but being pregnant with his child made things difficult. 

I never bonded with the baby , and the baby being his offspring contributed to the negative emotions that I felt. 

I told him that I didn't want this baby. So when he got together with the other woman, I gave her the choice to adopt the baby, which she did. With that, I officially signed over my parental rights as soon as the girl turned 6 months old (I left the day she was born). When I left, I told Mark that I didn't want anything to do with the girl and the other woman was free to be her mother. 

I moved to another country and tried to leave that part of my life behind. I met a wonderful man and we got married. He knew all about my past and now we have 3 wonderful kids who are 9, 5 and 2 years old. 

Recently, my ex Mark contacted me out of the blue and told me that my biological daughter, who is 14 now, wants to meet me. Apparently, his wife had passed away and before she died, she confessed that she wasn't her biological mother. 

I'm torn. I don't want to meet this kid. It was very difficult for me to leave that part of my life behind. I was depressed for years. I reminded him that I gave up my parental rights years ago and that I wanted nothing to do with both of them. I planned on telling my kids about their half sibling once they were grown and mentally mature, not right now when they are still so little. I told him to never contact me again and hanged up.

AITA for publicly telling my half sister to stay out of my life?,"My half sister has a weird obsession with me. She stalks me on my social media profile and acts like a deranged ex. I'm pretty popular on Instagram, where I also post my art, so making it private is not an option. 

She is 17, and I haven't seen her in  years. The last time I saw her, she was 12 and it was at my grandfather's funeral. 

My biological father had an affair with one of my mum's friends when she was dying. It was sick and my poor mum found out about it 5 days before she passed away. The other woman was already pregnant with my half sister. 

I was 15 and old enough to know what that meant. I refused to live with my dad (courts allowed it) and started living with my maternal grandparents. My 2 older siblings were in college and they haven't talked to him in years. 

We chose to keep them out of my life and we like it that way. 

Whenever I, my husband or my siblings make any sweet post, she literally spams the comments section with comments about us abandoning her and our biological father. 

I keep blocking her, but she comes back with new IDs every time. I definitely think she is not in a good mental place, and needs help. Possibly professional help. 

The last straw was on mothers day, when I tried to post a beautiful tribute to my mom. I posted many pictures. Some of those pictures were beautiful family pictures and I edited my biological father out of them. 

She commented about me posting edited pics and abandoning our father. It was a long post, and she actually posted several old family pictures in her account. That post got a lot of attention, and people started asking me about it. 

Only this time, I didn't delete her comment or block her. I replied under her post and asked her to stay away from my life. All this time, I avoided a confrontation because I believed she was young and misled by her parents. But as a 17 year old, she should know better. 




This was my reply :

 "" I don't know about others, but for me and my siblings, just because our biological father decided to have sex with some rando, and cheat on our dying mum, doesn't mean we owe anything to him or the result of his indiscretions. Please respect our boundaries and leave my family alone. You are old enough to understand this and if it bothers you, consider therapy. This level of obsession with our lives is really unhealthy. I wish you and your family well. ""

AITA for not bringing homemade treats to the office Christmas party? And telling of co-workers who expected me to?,"
This happened a couple weeks back. I am 22 and I'm one of very few women in my office at work. It's me, one other engineer, and two ladies in HR and administration. It kinda sucks and I wanna get a new job once my 401k is vested

Otherwise, there are a lot of guys. Like 50 or so. Most of them older guys with families

We had a potluck style party, and I was assigned a dessert. Everyone was asked to bring something. 

I picked up cupcakes from Aldi the night before the party, and thought that was settled. But when I brought them in, a couple people started giving me some shit for not bringing something homemade. Specifically 5 of my male coworkers.

I knew a lot of my coworkers have wives or even daughters who cook for them, like they'll have lunch made every day, and they weren't getting shit said about that

I was like ""How many of y'all cooked your own stuff for this? Not your wife, not your daughters, you yourself got in the kitchen and did it? Come on, raise your hands. Anyone at this here table put any work into this themselves??""  and none of them could.

I was like ""cool, well I'm single and unless one of you wants to buy me a mail order bride or some shit, don't complain"" 

I was being facetious, like I honestly don't think it's cool that they all act entitled to do fuck-all at home, and I would want no part in that life...

But it caused some drama at work, the HR rep got secondhand word that I was comparing people's wife's to mail order brides or something. Stuffs cool now,i explained myself, but it seems like it ruffled some feathers

AITA for possibly making my parents homeless?,"This isn't just me, it includes my twin brother. My brother and I (17m) were an accidental pregnancy. For context, our oldest sibling is 37 and has a kid who goes to our high school. Our nearest sibling in age is 28.

My parents always made it clear that we weren't supposed to exist. They were never abusive or neglectful or anything, but they were kind of cold our whole childhood. 

My brother and I will graduate high school in about a week, and will be 18 in two weeks. My parents have told us that as soon has we turn 18, we will have to pay rent. Neither of us have jobs, and we probably won't be able to get jobs right now.

I confided in my sister that I'm really stressed about this, and she offered to let my brother and I stay with her while we're in University, completely free of charge. I'm really grateful for this, and we're planning on accepting her offer.

I told my parents about this, and they freaked out. I guess my mom was planning to move to part time work and they needed rent from my brother and I to keep up with rent. They said that they have provided for us our whole lives, and we should pay them back now that we're almost adults. 

I mean, it's true. They have given us everything we needed for 18 years, and I really don't want them to be homeless if they can't afford the rent, but I don't know how I would even afford to live with them.

Edit- my brother and I both have some savings, so we could conceivably pay rent for a few months. I also feel guilty moving in with my sister, because she has three little kids and a cat to take care of, and I don't want to put any extra strain on her. None of my siblings have a great relationship with our parents, so my parents won't ask them for help.

Edit #2- I'm actually shocked by the support here. I've been talking it over with my brother, and we're going to move out as soon as we legally can. Thanks guys.

AITA for taking a 3 hour nap every afternoon and expecting my husband to look after the kid and only wake me up for emergencies?,"My husband (38) and I (34 f) have been married for 5 years. We have a 4 year old daughter and and a 3 month old son. Our son has a health condition and needs to be fed every 40 to 80 minutes. 

I work in IT and can easily work from home and generally make my own schedule. My husband works from 6am to 3pm. I get up every hour at night to feed our son so my husband can sleep. I drop our daughter off at kindie in the morning and then work and look after our son. I obviously don't get much sleep during the night so I have started to go to sleep from 3.30 to 7pm and I made it clear that I am not to be woken up unless it's an emergency. My husband looks after the kids and cooks tea while I'm asleep and at 7 we all eat. After that we take turns reading stories to our daughter as a bed time ritual. She's usually down for the night at 8. Then my husband and I have us time form 8 to roughly 9.30 which is when he goes to sleep. After that it's only me looking after our son so my husband can sleep through the night. I usually do some more work and go to sleep at around midnight but obviously very interrupted sleep since I have to get up every hour. 

My husband has started complaining recently. He doesn't think I should sleep in the afternoon because during that time childcare is on him completely. He wants some time to relax when he gets home. But the thighs is, I need a few hours of uninterrupted sleep too otherwise I'll go crazy. Our son will most likely outgrow his condition and should be able to live a normal toddler life by the time he is 18 months. I can't possibly not sleep for another year and 3 months though.

AITA for bringing up to neighbor how his daughter still lives at home after he pulled me asside while I was shoveling to lecture me on why I shouldn't still be living with my parents?,"I've moved out 3 times so far. Moved away to Cali for a year and a half after highschool, didn't work out, moved back home.

after a few months I got place a couple towns over with 3 roommates. 2 of the roommates left halfway through forcing us to break the lease because we couldn't afford it. moved back home.

Moved out a third time after a couple months, did a year lease with my best friend at an apartment in the same town, then moved back home after because I'm leaving in 5 months to move to Georgia with my current girlfriend and nobody will sign a 5 month lease.

I don't feel great about it, but I'm 23 and for the third time I have been forced to move back in with my parents.

Yesterday I was out shoveling the driveway so it would be done before my parents woke up.

The next door neighbor was out too, and he comes over and asks me how things are going.

He very quickly mentions how I'm too old to still be living with my parents. I'm already embarrassed enough by it as it is, but I know I have solid plans to move out again in 5 months. I didn't think this was worth mentioning to him, as I feel like he has no business caring about his next door neighbor's lives.

I get heated very very quickly because I was honestly taken back by his comment. I stop him mid sentence and mention to him

""doesn't your daughter still live with you? your daughter who's like 35? your daughter, along with her husband and like what? 5? 6 kids? don't they still live here with you?""

he starts yelling that I'm rude to mention that, how it's not the same thing, how they have kids and it's a different circumstance, etc etc etc. 

I'm getting more and more frustrated, it's 7:00 in the morning and I have work in an hr. I decide to just walk away and continue shoveling when I see him start to fucking fling his driveway snow into my driveway! I'm like ""DUDE WHAT THE FUCK? ARE YOU 6???""
 
my dad wakes up around this time and sees us outside arguing so he comes out and starts arguing with him himself. I go back inside and get ready for work and here I am after work wondering if I crossed the line by mentioning his daughter. I really don't think I did but it's starting to eat at me a bit.

tl;dr neighbor tells me I'm too old to still live at home so I bring up the fact that his even older daughter and husband still live with him, along with their 5+ children.

edit: I can't possibly read all these comments, but the vast majority have settled my doubts about this situation. I feel kind of awkward right now, didn't really think this one interaction between 2 unknown people was worthy of being read by thousands, but thank you.

AITA for expecting a guy who invites me to his house for a movie date at dinner time to offer drinks or food?,"The setup: I’ve known this guy for a couple years and we’ve worked together occasionally. We’ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.

I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.

I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” 

He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men’s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he’s low on cash. But isn’t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I’d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn’t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. 

I call out casually “what do you got to drink?” 

He calls back “Do you like tap water?”

This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he’s serious. There’s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

I call out, “Yeah, sure.”

He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.

I’m starving. I haven’t eaten since 8am. 

I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” 

He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”

This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. 

Then he asks me to have sex with him.

I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.

I don’t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (And then they can offer to split the tab)

AITA for hiding my friends laptop because he imposed restrictions on me in my house?,"I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out.

This is my first year in college. Everything is working out fine EXCEPT for my roommate. Ever since I moved here I just can’t stand him. Why? I can write a whole story about why I despise this person but I don’t wanna keep this long so I will just mention the key points.

1. He is really messy. His room is a total mess (not that I sleep there but I don’t have TV in my room and sometimes have to go to his room for it. NOTE that we are paying equal rent so he isn’t doing me a favor for it).
2. He used to not even wash his plates until I told him I am not washing for him.
3. He would leave a mess everywhere until I had to explain to him like he is a little kid as to why it’s not good to have a dirty house.
4. Bathroom smells horrible whenever he leaves it. He can’t even clean the toilet after use.

Luckily though, I would rarely see him because I would spend most of my times at either the library, gym or with friends or my girlfriend after classes. Now though, because of what is happening, I must stay in the house which is killing me.

I now have to work out and study at home. I like to jump the rope as a cardio exercise for 10-15 minutes which can make some noise. 2 days ago, while I was exercising he told me to stop jumping rope and find something else because I make too much noise. I got so pissed off because I never complain when he does things that bother me but now he can’t even handle some noise for 10 minutes? I told him I won’t stop so he just went back to his room. Yesterday though when I wanted to work out again I couldn’t find my rope. I asked him if he has seen it and told me he HID IT from me and will give it back to me when he finishes studying as he can’t concentrate. I got so pissed off because again IT’S JUST 10-15 MINUTES, maybe 20 with breaks in between. I never complain when he bothers me but he can’t even handle this. Because of this, I hid his laptop when he was out today. While I was working out, he asked me if I had seen his laptop and I told him I will give it to him after I finish working out. He said he has an online exam tomorrow and that he needs it now to revise but I refused to give it. I’m physically stronger than him so he can’t do me anything either. He just went back to his room.

Well. When I finished working out he asked for the laptop back. I went outside to get it but I couldn’t find it anymore. I think someone must have stolen it. I told him I couldn’t find it and he told me that if I don’t give his laptop back today he will press charges on me but he has no proof so I doubt it will work. He is blaming me for stealing his laptop but I just hid it because he tried imposing restrictions on me. I didn’t know it will get stolen. Today I even caught him stalking me on social media. I called him out on this.

AITA for this? Or did he go too far?

WIBTA if I reported a nurse for breaking HIPAA rules?,"I (18F) had my mom schedule me an appointment for severe abdominal pain. She forgot that I had switched clinics a couple of months ago, so she made me an appointment at my old kids clinic. Because of corona, we scheduled a FaceTime appt.


During my appt, the only questions the nurse asked me were coronavirus related. Since she wasn’t asking me about my pain, I told her my symptoms. I also mistakenly thought she was a different doctor I saw last year, and she took great offense to that. For the rest of the appointment, she was curt, rude, and when I tried to apologize for mistaking her for someone else, she ended the FaceTime call. The entire appt lasted 7 minutes.

Because I had such a bad experience, I went back to my clinic. The doctor I saw there was kind, knowledgeable, and immediately knewwhat to do. He ordered an x-ray, and I got the X-ray as soon as our appt was over.

So for some reason, the X-ray was sent to the first nurse instead of my doctor. She called my mom to ask for my phone number, since she cannot legally talk to my mom without consent from me. During this phone call with my mom, these are some of the things she said:


-My poor diet is to blame for my pain ( I eat a very balanced diet and she didn’t ask me about it, how would she know?)


-She accused me of lying to my mom about my symptoms. She said that as an 18 year old, I was too embarrassed to tell my mom the truth. She also said that I was constipated and I had blood in my stool (neither of those are true). 


-She said that I was too focused on going to parties to care about my health (I do not party)


- She said that I spent the entire appointment backpedaling for my mistaking her for someone else, and wasted the appointment.


-She said that although I am 18, I am not mature enough to care about my health, make my own decisions, and said I was no different than a child.


-After she attacked me for my character, she discussed the results of the X-ray with my mom. I’m pretty sure this is illegal. She admitted to my mom that she wasn’t allowed to discuss my medical information with her, and that it was illegal, but she did it anyway. Unfortunately the phone call was not recorded.


-She never ended up getting my phone number from my mother (which is on file so she didn’t need it anyway), so I believe she meant to call my mom this whole time


When my mom told me what she said, I started crying and was very angry. I think what she did is illegal, I never signed any consent forms allowing doctors to share my medical information with anyone else.


So here’s the part where I could be an asshole. I don’t care if my parents see my medical information. Her discussing my X-ray results with my mom does not hurt me at all. However, based on her other behavior and the fact that she did break the law, I want to report her. Although I know what she did was wrong, I would be reporting her out of spite and anger. 

So WIBTA if I reported this nurse?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my disabled SIL to come live with us?,"My husband and I have been together for about ten years. We have three young kids and a fairly hectic life, as you can imagine. 

My husband has a sister who has cerebral palsy. She is 38 years old, but cognitively has the development of about a five year old. She can’t really speak clearly, but she can make some sounds for common words to say what she needs. My husband can understand her better than I can, but I’m trying to get better. She’s not permanently wheelchair bound, but she can’t go up stairs or walk long distances so she does have some medical equipment to help. She needs help doing everything for her basic care, from bathing to dressing to feeding. 

He obviously grew up with her so he’s very used to everything she needs. When we go to visit my in laws, it always seems to me like their entire livelihood revolves around her. She also throws big tantrums when she doesn’t get what she wants. There ends up being a lot of yelling from all sides. I find the whole environment so stressful and tense, but it’s what they’re used to. 

My husband’s parents are getting older and I think it’s getting more difficult to care for her. My husband approached me a few weeks ago saying he thinks it’s time his sister comes to live with us. My whole world came to a screeching halt. We had talked about us helping financially and coordinating care before, but never about her actually coming to live with us. 

In truth, I just can’t picture us staying afloat while adding her into the mix at our house. We have three kids under 6. It’s a madhouse here all the time already. If she lived here, we’d need to have all three kids in one bedroom. We’d also need to get some serious modifications to our house because it’s not handicap friendly. Also, I  truly think this would ruin the relationships we are building with our kids. I think my husband and I would have to spend so much time and energy caring for his sister that we wouldn’t be able to focus on our own kids. This breaks my heart and is the big dealbreaker for me. 

I suggested moving his family closer to us (they currently live 5 hours away) and seeing how we can help without them living with us. I said we need to start looking into some appropriate assisted living facilities and he flipped out on me. He says he promised his mom he’d take care of his sister, she’s his blood, etc.  I understand it’s his sister, but I also feel he has his own new family to consider, too, that he’s completely ignoring in this equation. 

Obviously this is a big fuckup on both of our parts to not discuss this in detail much earlier on. I can’t picture us managing this with three kids, and it just makes me sad to think of us 30+ years down the road when we’re “empty nesters” and always having his sister there by our side. To be honest, if I knew his sister coming to live with us forever was a total mandatory for him, it might have meant the end of our relationship.

Edit: wow this post blew up a little bit. Thanks for everyone’s replies. I am reading through them and it’s helpful to see from all sides. I do want to clarify that it’s not that we hadn’t talked about this at all. We had talked about it, but the extent of support we had talked about was financial support and coordinating outside care. We had never discussed her coming to live with us. I understand it was a miss to not discuss that overtly, but it felt like we had a solid plan before that about helping in all other ways and getting her proper care as she and we get older. So I think this has been a change of heart now that it’s becoming real.",Not the A-hole
AITA for 'forcing' my GF to get an abortion?,"I (24M) had been dating my GF Amy (24F) for 2ish years. We didn't live together but were in the same complex. I lived with my old college roommate and Amy lived with an old GF of mine in highschool (good terms). I had plans on proposing in the near future and got a ring from her roomate for sizing. 

Before I could propose, Amy told me she was pregnant. I was happy because we both wanted kids shortly after getting married anyways. I was was in a good spot fincially and we both had good jobs. We had a deep talk and she was planning to keep the child and being a family. I went engagement ring shopping the next day and ordered the ring. 2 or 3 weeks later she told me she got the abortion because she didn't feel ready and wanted to advance her career first.

I was upset but understood. I was mentally invested in our future family for a few weeks. We had talked about it during this time. But I felt like Amy flipped the switch on my when we could've talked more about her decision. I didn't show any hate towards her but she could tell I was upset. Some time passed and she asked what was wrong and I told her, 'We could've been a happy family,' before I left that day. I knew was over then. We fizzled out in a few weeks and I ended it. It really came down to her flipping from keeping the baby to getting the abortion without telling me. 

A few weeks after it ended Amy showed up at my door upset at me saying I forced her into an abortion. Her roommate/my old GF had told her about my family money when she told her about the abortion. In short, my family is wealthy and I could just not work. I choose to live my life without their money for now. A kind of I want to be my own man thing. I'm on good terms with them.

Amy bascially told me she got the abortion because we weren't finicially set. I didn't agree with that at all. Even without my family money I do very well for myself. I didn't live a cheap life and always paid for everything, including international vacations. She also knew my salary. I never told her about my family money because I saw how money affected my siblings relationships before. I had planned to tell her after the proposal when we talked about wedding costs. Thinking it would be a 'you can have your dream wedding, not worry about money, do what makes you happy if thats working or being a SAHM.' But Amy just went ahead with the abortion without telling me. If she told me her she wanted the abortion because of financials I would've told her right then. But she got it done after weeks about us talking about raising the child together. 

Amy basically blamed me for the abortion saying I should've told her about my family money before. I told her about my plan to tell her when I proposed. But she got the abortion after telling me she wanted to keep the baby and there was nothing I could do. She wanted to get back together but in short I didn't think it would ever work. 

So AITA for not revealing my family wealth to Amy and 'forcing' her into an abortion?

AITA for not letting my friends enter the Forbidden Room?,"OK, this is a throwaway, on mobile, English isn’t my first language, etc.

So I (M20) live with another guy (M19), who I’ll refer to as Red. Red’s autistic, and he’s not a party person. I am. He also is extremely camera-shy, like he’ll go out of his way to hide if someone is taking a photo that he could appear in. That’s perfectly fine, but I still like my parties. So we came up with the Forbidden Room. The Forbidden Room is a small room we have, that we made super comfortable with a fuckton of pillows, a mattress, and noise-cancelling headphones. Whenever a party stresses him out, or people are taking a lot of photos, he locks himself in the Forbidden Room. There’s two keys, one is with me, the other is with him.

I never specified what the Forbidden Room is. I only told people it’s locked, and so they can’t access it. (Which is true — Red unlocks it to enter). The arrangement works great for Red and I. A few days ago, someone in the group WhatsApp casually mentioned Red disappears in parties, so I mentioned the Forbidden Room’s purpose. (Red knew I was telling them.) 

My friends are all now mad at me, because that’s not a real reason to lock up a room, and that they like Red, and want to chill more with him, and by doing this, I’m essentially allowing him to remain socially distant from others. They’ve demanded entry next time to the Forbidden Room, and I’ve denied them; and they tried to compromise by saying anyONE can have a downtime in the room, and I’ve refused that.

Red’s argument is, he can’t tolerate being social for very long, and some of my friends have taken pictures and posted them online without his permission, and created a scene when he asked for it to be taken down; and that he doesn’t trust they’ll use the Forbidden Room responsibly, and it doesn’t solve his need to hide in a place on his own.

So, AITA for having a forbidden room that only Red is allowed in?

EDIT: this got a lot of attention overnight. I’m gonna try and read through this with Red, once he’s up. 

Some points of clarification:

-  I’m not throwing parties at the moment

- a few said it’s super obvious that I’m NTA, but honestly, based on my friends response to me wanting Red’s Forbidden Room to stay intact, I might as well have committed a crime, to the point I second-guessed myself.

- I am no longer second guessing myself, the Forbidden Room is staying.

EDIT #2

- Red and I are reading through all of your comments. He says hi! and to all his autistic friends, he recommends a Forbidden Room.

- He also says thanks, and this made him feel significantly less crazy for having the need to disappear.

- Happy cake day?? I keep seeing this around. No idea what it means.",Not the A-hole
AITA for laughing at my girlfriend for her suggestion to pay off her loan,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Me(32) and my girlfriend(29) are living together for a year and going out for two. I make about 1.5 times the amount she makes and split all our bills including rent 60-40.  She has a huge student loan in low six digits. So here's the incident. Yesterday, she came up to me and asked why I was not helping pay off her student loan.I asked her whether she wants me to help plan her budget or is she expecting me to help pay of her loan. she said it was the  latter. I told her I am not willing to join finances as long as we are not married. But she retorted that I have more than enough in my savings and it's unfair that I am not helping her pay off her student loan. So, I asked her if she was expecting me to take my savings and completely pay off her loan. She nodded and I started laughing uncontrollably. She got upset and has informed most of her friends and they have been calling me an asshole as I am not helping her. I would have been fine if she had asked if she could reduce her share of the bills, but for her to suggest this I don't know how else to react. She has been giving me the silent treatment since.

AITA for telling my mother and siblings that they are now dead to me?,"Two years ago I (21F) married a Korean man (27M) we have been together for four years, and if I have to be honest my family never liked him because he's Asian. They (my mother and my siblings) used to make fun of his eyes, and they even made fun of his height, he's really tall and for them ""real"" Asians can't be tall.

Last year I got pregnant and they were ""happy"" because my daughter is the first grandchild. Well, now my daughter is three weeks old and my family didn't want to come to meet her because my sister, who decided to get pregnant after knowing that I was pregnant, doesn't want them to come to visit me and my husband because she thinks my husband is ""infected"", she is obsessed with the virus that is affecting many people lately (the virus that started in China)
My mother avoided my texts for weeks and when I sent her pictures of my daughter she didn't even answer me. And one of my sisters even made fun of my daughter's eyes, I sent her a picture of her and she said ""oh she has *chinky eyes* like *my husband's first name*"" I tried to ignore that kind of comments but I had enough.


Yesterday they decided that they wanted to come to meet our daughter so they showed up at my house with gifts for her but I didn't open the door and when she called me to tell me that they were outside I said that we only accept visits from family members and that they are no longer my family, and my mom ""cried"" and told me that she has the right to meet her first granddaughter that I was being cruel but I told her to shut the fuck up and I hung up the phone.
Today my sister (the one who said that my daughter has chinky eyes) sent me a text saying that she is very sorry and that she wants to meet my daughter but I told her not to contact me anymore because for me they are dead and I blocked all my ""family"" from everywhere.

AITA for kicking my disabled mother out of my house because she isn't accepting of my gay relationship?,"My mother is widowed, without many funds and suffering from heart failure, with an ejection fraction of less than 15% and a bunch of other stuff wrong with her. She isn't eligible for a transplant for a number of reasons and at this point according to optimistic doctors she has another 10 years left. Before her diagnosis, she had a lot of money saved for retirement but since then, to pay for all of the medical expenses she has and her expensive meds on a monthly basis she's had to sell her home and move in with me, her only child. 

So I've been letting her live with me rent free for about three years now since she fell sick. Things have mostly been fine, but that's because I haven't been in a relationship during this time. I've had relationships in the past that would end because of my fear of my parents finding out, who were always extremely homophobic, especially my mom. My mom isn't homophobic with the excuse of religion, she just blatantly hates the entire LGBT movement and has said some incredibly hurtful things over the years without knowing I'm gay that have stuck with me all my life. She's also racist. But, she's my mother, so I accepted her into my home because she didn't have anywhere else to go as no extended family could or were willing to accommodate her.

A few months ago I met my current boyfriend, we'll call him Steve. I decided that I'll have some balls and tell my mom I'm gay and introduce Steve to her afterwards judging by her reaction, since she literally lives with me I thought just maybe she could sit and bear it and then find out for herself that her entire world view is wrong after seeing us together for a while. Not only did she tell me she's disappointed in me and started crying about how she should have raised me better, she told me I was going to catch aids and die if I stay with him.

I told her she has a month to find other living accommodations and that she can't stay here, and that I don't care where she goes as long as she gets out of my house. I said this quite calmly and gave her notice to find someplace, so I think I didn't do anything wrong but other members of my family think that I've practically made my mother homeless, and since no one else wants to accommodate her and she has no funds and a severe disability she'll end up in a shelter. Honestly, it's not my problem anymore. I'm sick of sacrificing for her when she can't even accept me for who I am, so if she's homeless, she had it coming.

But anyway, do you think I'm the AH?

Edit: Sorry if this wasn't clear, but she met Steve a week after I originally came out. There's some extra info in my comments if you want more background on my childhood or her beliefs, it wouldn't fit the word count if I pasted them all here.

Edit 2: Read my reply to u/nihil_esque 's comment if you want more info, but after reading through all of the comments I've decided to give my mom a 6 month grace period to get used to me being gay and if she still can't tolerate me after that I'll personally put her in an assisted living facility.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my wife for an abortion.,"Me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. We’re not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn’t have kids.

Now I’ve been putting off getting a vasectomy, I did get one a few weeks ago but I was just procrastinating it which was my fault I guess. However I used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. So about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and I realized that I’d ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she’s on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. I go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything’s all good.

Nope. She’s now six weeks pregnant, I was surprised cause isn’t she supposed to be on birth control? Come to find out that she hasn’t been taking it for at least a few months now. On top of that, she wants to keep the kid which I am very against, she’s very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she’s against having kids too. I feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows I’m very against kids and not only that but I was a foster child and don’t know anything about my parents so I have no clue what inheritable diseases I may have. 

I really don’t want to have a kid. So much so that I’m thinking of divorcing her if she’s not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest I might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

I have told her that I’m against this pregnancy but I haven’t pushed any further than that. Would I be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",Not the A-hole
AITA for suggesting that my trans friend wear a towel at a Japanese sauna?,"I am a 20 y/o girl. I am in Japan on exchange with some friends of mine. Most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. She was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. Currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. However, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

Anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or Japanese bath house. Basically, you are expected to get completely naked. Everything is gender segregated. There is a separate men’s section and women’s section.

My friend who is trans also wanted to go. So we all went as a group. Everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but I think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. Finally, when we were in the changing rooms, I quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

She asked me why and I told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. She got mad at me and said sarcastically, “Thanks for your concern.” In the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said I was out of line for suggesting it. They both thought it was none of my business. I explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that I’m just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

They avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. There were some looks but not as bad as if she didn’t wear a towel.

I apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said I meant no disrespect. But she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that I am transphobic, although I do not believe that I am. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for continuously asking my in laws about their tradition of women eating after men?,"Am not a native English speaker, so sorry for any mistakes.

When I (F) first met my husband's family, I noticed they had a tradition where all the females (it's a huge family living together) would cook the food together and the men would eat first after which the women would eat. I didn't initially comment on it, not wanting to get into a conflict with people I didn't know too well.

As years passed though, I got more annoyed with this tradition. For one thing, the food would be cold by the time I (and other women) begin to eat. We also usually visited during holidays and festivals, and a lot of expensive delicacies that is not normally prepared otherwise is made then, and I don't always get any because their might not be leftovers. Not to mention, I help cook, so it seems absurd to me that I have to wait hungry while others are done. None of the other women seem to mind this.

A few months back, before eating, we were all in the living room and I thought I would ask them about this.

Me: Can we all eat at the same time?

FIL: No. This is an old tradition in our family because men would be really hungry after  coming back from work.

Me: Most of the women work nowadays though.

FIL: It seems really wrong to suddenly stop something we have been doing for so long now.

This continues on for a while - FIL insisting it's a tradition and shouldn't be broken and me saying it's sexist. Nothing changed, men ate first like usual, and I dropped it. However I had several of my husband's relatives  come up to me and say that I am an asshole for questioning their traditions, and that I don't stay with them and asking this makes me an asshole. A lot of the women also think I am an asshole because they think I made a big fuss about nothing.

AITA for letting a guy quit while I was firing him so I wouldn’t have to pay severance?,"I’m a small business owner and I had to let one of my employees go today. 

I called him in and began to explain that he was being let go and why, and he stops me and goes on a bit of tirade, you know, “I’m the one who makes this place run. I’m the last guy who should be getting fired.” And I was sitting, letting him get it out of his system. Then he says: 

“And what’s more, you can’t fire me. You can’t fire someone who doesn’t work here. *I*. *QUIT*.” So I seized the moment and said “You’re quitting?” 

And this is the PG version but basically he said  “You’re damn right I am!” And I said “So you’re resigning your post, you are choosing to not work here anymore, you are leaving your job?” 

He said yes, he said a few other things, he left. I processed his removal as though he’d quit. I no longer had to pay him severance of any kind. 

Now I feel a bit badly. Because I know getting fired is tough and you sometimes react off the cuff, I’ve been there. 

But he did go on a loud, insulting, profanity laced tirade making statements against me and his coworkers and our clients, and most importantly, he really he did quit. 

Am I the asshole for letting him quit instead of giving him the benefits he would have been entitled to if he were fired?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my (23f) bf (26m) I’m uninterested in having kids with him after saying he’d love it more if it’s a boy?,"So my bf and I have been together a year. We had an instant connection from the beginning but took 4 months to actually date (in total we’ve been involved for 16mths). We talk all the time about having children and marriage when I’m done with school/when he’s paid off all his student loans from university.

When talking about the future of kids, he’s said many many times he’d rather have a boy than a girl. Everyone has preference, it’s fine. 

So last night watching a movie about a family w multiple kids, I jokingly said he would love our kids more than he loves me. (I think that’s normal to love kids more than spouse sometimes, and it was a complete joke I didn’t think he’d even respond to.)

He got a serious tone and said “if it’s a boy I will, not if it’s a girl”.

I told him that if he has that deep rooted resentment towards women and is that sexist in a way, we shouldn’t have kids as that’s not the proper mindset to have nor should gender decide how much you love them. 

He said it’s rude I’d tell him that I don’t want to have his kids now and that his mindset is normal and many men love their sons more than daughters.

To me, his mindset/ability to only love a boy that much feels like he thinks the opposite sex (women) are lesser compared to men. I’m not easily offended, but this seems like if he had a son he’d raise it the same way, which is concerning

UPDATE; thank you SO MUCH to everyone who commented with experiences, opinions, and different viewpoints than mine! I was NOT expecting this to blow up how it did. 

For those that came to the conclusion I wanted to be told I’m right, I didn’t make this post to be told I’m NOT the asshole, he genuinely made me feel like a nut case for having an issue with his beliefs. I felt guilty for not wanting his children. 

I talked to him and told him that I can’t be in a relationship with someone who I can’t have kids with and that I feel doesn’t respect me simply bc I have a vagina. He said he was kidding and I’m being too sensitive and I didn’t understand him (lol). Once he thought I was serious he said he would chanfe. I educated him on why his viewpoint is sexist and hope he changes to be a better man for someone else. 

I believe he loved me and we were meant to be together for some period of time but we weren’t compatible when it came to our views on topics like what I posted about. He took it well but was in disbelief I was “overreacting so much”. His idea of this came from his father and growing up he was told women are inferior and having boys is ideal. He said with the break up he’d be going to stay in Pennsylvania with his father for a bit, for anyone worried about what could happen after. 

Yes there’s a possibility his mindset could change, but I’m not willing to train a 26 y/o to see my worth as a woman. This is a huge deal breaker for me. 

I’m heartbroken and so sad as this is the person I’m in love with, HOWEVER, life will go on and I’m better off without someone that doesn’t see me (or our potential babies) as en equal bc of my gender. Thanks everyone!

UPDATE UPDATE- please don’t message me about my opinion of men and women being equal being wrong. You won’t change it. I’m getting very nasty messages for leaving this person, but it was my choice. After thinking back to other instances he overall DID see me as inferior and was sexist, I just didn’t think much into these things bc he was good to me. Gonna say again, this man loved me I know, but if you do not see someone as your equal you can’t love them fully (which he’s given an example of by saying this about potential daughter).",Not the A-hole
AITA for not disciplining my daughter for laying into a nosy woman at church?,"My wife and I have one 14 yo adopted daughter, Sarah, which is relevant to the story. We recently found out that she has PCOS, which I'd never heard of before. Part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

Between this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. Today at church, some woman decided that Sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her CHANCE at a free baby. Sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

My wife thinks that Sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. I don't agree.

First off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if Sarah WAS pregnant? Infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. I recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. With her medical problems, Sarah will probably be infertile herself, which I think puts her on par on that point. Secondly, Sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. I don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem. I've had physical fights over less. Maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.

AITA for letting our daughter get off scot free?

Ninja edit: Sarah will have to be on oral birth control for her entire life, and may actually lose at least one ovary in this surgery. I'd say she qualifies for infertility on those grounds. I don't know how it wouldn't.",Not the A-hole
AITA for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?,"Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. 

I’m getting married next year and I’m so excited about it. My fiancé has all his groomsmen picked out, and I’m in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I’d also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I’m sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. 

I drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he’d be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said “Will you be a part of my Bride Tribe?”, deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E’s ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.

Fast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E’s reaction didn’t go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to “fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold” despite his transition. I tried to explain that I’d picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn’t get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me “basic” and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.

I guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he’d be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he’s still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it’s best if he isn’t a part of the bridal party. My fiancé says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I’m being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don’t it will cause all kinds of family drama.

Would I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

ETA: 
Wow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I’m going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

E sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for “snapping at me”. He admitted he was wrong and it was “totally out of line” and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party “if I’d have him”. Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven’t sent any response yet. 

A also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

ALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?,"Just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. I feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

I just had a baby on July 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. I know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like I have to entertain also. It would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that I expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). She also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores I could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

She texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. This is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and I'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. I wrote her back and told her that I'm really not up for visitors this week because I'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. She hasn't talked to me since yesterday after I wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. AITA here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to watch my grandchildren overnight twice a week,"I have 3 children, 30m, 28f and 20f. My son has 3 children, my oldest daughter has 3 also and my youngest has 1.

When my oldest grandchild turned 1 I'd occasionally have him overnight to give my son and DIL a break. Then as more came along I'd watch them too but now I feel it's at a point I can't cope with watching 7 children all in the one night like my children have wanted me to do so I've been watching them in groups of 2-4 once a week or so. 

I don't want to sound like I don't care about my grandchildren but I had my oldest child at 14, my parents refused to help raise my children apart from paying for the basics until I turned 16 which was obviously their choice so from a young age I've worked full time while raising children. I've told my children on several occasions that I don't mind helping out now and then with overnight visits but at the same time I want to go traveling etc now I have some time to myself and also finally work on my career. I always take my grandchildren, children and their partners out once a week for a big family dinner and I see my grandchildren several times a week between that. 

Today my 3 children came over together and told me they'd been talking and they felt I'm not pulling my weight when it comes to helping with my grandchildren. They've asked that I watch all the children every Friday and Saturday night so they can get some time to themselves and their partner. I told them no, watching all 7 children is exhausting for 2 days in a row every week as they're so excited to see eachother and it's also lots of work getting 7 children fed, bathed and into bed. As a compromise I said I'd watch either all 7 one night every 2nd weekend or continue as things are watching them once a week in smaller groups. 

They're not happy at this at all. They said as the children's gran I should be expected to help out so things aren't so stressful for them as parents. I already help out financially by paying for each grandchild to go to 2 after school activities a week. I understand my children are probably stressed from dealing with the kids all day everyday through lock down and I'm happy to make up for that time by watching them a bit more often for a few months but am I such a horrible person for not wanting to give up my entire weekend on a weekly basis? They've left me to 'think it over' but I've told them I won't change my mind. I'll also add that they've all admitted they aren't done having more children with my son saying they're currently trying for a 4th so I don't know what they expect me to do as numbers increase

Edit: thank you everyone for your comments. I've responded and read as many as I can for tonight but it's 2am and my eyes are closing. I'll try reply to anymore tomorrow! You've all been very kind and thank you for the awards too

Edit 2: wow this blew up overnight. Thank you so much for the awards that people have given me. I've sent the link to my children to this for them to read and I haven't heard back yet. I also told them in a group chat that going forward I think they should watch each others kids on a rota and I will help out once a month or so. There's so many comments that I don't know if I'll make it through them all but I'll try my best

Hopefully my final edit...

My son's been and gone. First of all he thinks you're all a bunch of see you next Tuesday's for being so concerned about him and his sisters lives and how their children are looked after. He's read lots of your replies and has had to 'stop himself replying back in anger'. 

He's deeply upset and angry at me for telling the internet our problems. I said to him who else am I supposed to turn to for advice when my own children think so little of me. 

He said him and his sisters are at breaking point since lockdown in March as I wasn't willing to break the rules and allow the kids come to my home. Apparently I've no idea what it's like having to be around children 24/7 with no escape. I tried telling him lockdown wasn't exactly a picnic for me either and I missed them all and their children. He again said if I missed them so much I'd be grateful to get to spend every weekend with my grandchildren as I'll have realised what I was missing. I told him I had infact realised what I was missing by not having to run around after children almost daily in one way or another and spend my weekends childminding for free. I told him I was done being an unpaid childminder and from now on I would watch one 'set' of grandchildren a month and take each child out once or twice a month on their own for a couple of hours so I get to know them rather than spending hours stressed by their company.

He started crying hard saying I can't do this to them, I've no idea what it's like. I reminded him exactly what I had given up to raise him and his sisters and it was now my time to enjoy life while seeing my grandchildren a healthy amount. I told him I'll pay for one activity a month per child and the rest is on them as I know they can afford it. He ended up saying he was leaving as he was too angry to discuss it further. On his way out he kicked one of my plantpots over and it broke. 

So now I don't know what life will be like going forward but I've told him what I'm willing to do and the rest is on them. I'll need to talk to my daughter's too about it but one has already told me she couldn't cope watching 7 children once a month.  I also let him know he was an idiot for trying for a 4th child when he's barely there for the 3 he has and wants to spend even less time with them by giving them to me all weekend.

Part of me feels good that I stood up for myself but the other part is feeling pretty shitty for how this has happened. I'm going to use some of my savings and book a few days away next week to the middle of nowhere with my boyfriend where we can actually relax in each others company for once",Not the A-hole
"AITA for scolding my MIL because she said ""I euthanized my first child"" in front of my toddler?","I met my current husband in college. We were not really super serious at the time - but it was a fun, lighthearted relationship. In my graduating year I fell pregnant (with his baby). It obviously was not planned.

We decided for an abortion - life was just about to begin and we didn't want to start off with a baby.

As neither of us worked at the time, we both asked our parents for money (not saying for what) - well somehow his mom still got wind of what the money was for and made a terrible scene about how we can't abort her grandchild, how we can go live with them if money is an issue, that she'll find a place for the crib, etc etc.

My parents then heard about the situation, agreed I should not ruin my life, and paid for my abortion.

I remained with the same guy, and later married. My MIL never really forgave me for the abortion and throughout the years made passive aggressive comment about it. I generally ignored them.

Fast forward 12 years. I have a 4 year old toddler. I was visiting my inlaws, and at some point was left alone with my MIL and my son. We never became close, but we're generally courteous.

My son was doing a puzzle, and he finished it in an impressive time - I said something along the lines of ""they grow up so fast"" somewhat wistfully.

To which my MIL said something like: ""They do. You'd have a teenager by now if you hadn't euthanized your first one"".

I LOST it. No, obviously my son does not understand that word, but it's the principle. And the way she said it. We fully plan to tell our son about contraceptives, abortion, and even that we had one - but when it's age appropriate, and and a moment my husband and I will choose.

I hissed ""other room, NOW"". She must have seen by my demeanor I was not kidding around so she followed. I closed the door, and scolded her, the frustration of those last years getting out. I told her I will not tolerate this bullshit anymore, that she does NOT get to talk to me like that, and that if she ever mentions this in front of my son again, I won't let them go to their house.

I then grabbed my son, and left.

My MIL has since played the victim to both my husband and FIL. Saying I was horrible.

I also really do not know what to do towards the future. My FIL is a great guy and a great grandpa, and my son adores him. I also don't want to ruin my husband's relationship with his parents.

But at this point I really don't want to let my son near her.

AITA for yelling at her, and threatening she won't see my child again? Or am I overreacting?

EDITS:
- My husband did bring this up with her, but  is at a loss on how to deal with it, too.
 
- She found out originally because we didn't get our stories straight about money

- After reading some comments, we will likely pursue counseling.",Not the A-hole
AITA for walking into my flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave?,"I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem

She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.

So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. 

The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?

**To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS. Me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. What she did was say ''Okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. I'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",Asshole
AITA for feeding my vegan nephew meat?,"My sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. 

I usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. 

So basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year).

AITA for throwing away containers?,"I meal prep my husbands breakfasts and lunches in those little black plastic, compartmented containers.

An ongoing argument is that he leaves the sealed containers at work (he's a mechanic in a shop) for several days, bringing home a stack of 10 hot, sealed, dirty containers that he piles on the counter or in the sink. I have asked him to bring them home every day, he forgets. I ask him to rinse them out at work. He forgets/cant/wont. I ask him to please take the lids off so the reek doesnt just keep getting worse. He cracks the lids open kinda on a few. Theres juice or bits of food baking in the heat from everything like eggs and sausage to ground beef to mashed potatoes. 

It's ""gag a maggot"" level when you open them, to the point theres pressure building in the containers so you get whooooshed in the face with hot garbage air. 

I told him to wash his own. That's how i wound up with 50+ containers taking up every inch of my kitchen because ""i dont have time to do dishes every day. If i have to wash dishes you just have to wait until saturday."" 

So i told him, ""Fine. I cook 100% of the meals in those containers. I make the list to buy the food and i deal with the shopping. Im the only one washing them. So if you cant use any of the options i gave you to keep them from rotting in a hot shop, im throwing them in the trash every time i find a sealed one."" 

He evidently didnt believe me because last night when he took out the trash, most of the bag was full of containers, some with utensils still in them. He freaked out and said we cant afford to replace all of it and i told him to remember thats what we tell our three year old about not scratching his movies because he wont have movies if he ruins them. 

And the three year old learned. 

So hes pissed that i threw away the containers and he is eating steak and mashed potatoes with one of the toddlers mini forks out of a ziplock bag today.

AITA for having narcotic pain meds in my medicine cabinet?,"Throwaway because I'm gonna reveal some medical info and some IRL people know my main account.

Wife had a C Section about 3 months ago. She was prescribed Norco (Hydrocodone) for the pain. We filled the prescription (20 pills) and then she never took it. She used Motrin and Tylenol only. The pill bottle went into the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where we forgot about it.

Fast forward to Christmas Day. We don't want to take an infant around to all our families gatherings in flu season, so we stayed home and invited anyone over who wanted to stop by during the day.

My wife's sister (so my SIL) Jane and her boyfriend Bob came by. Jane and Bob have been dating for a few months. I never met the guy before. My wife met him once. My point is that I don't know this dude from Adam, but he seemed like a nice guy. They stayed for a while, played with the baby, exchanged some presents, and we all had a good time before they left to go to their next stop.

A few days later, Jane calls my wife irate and screaming. Bob stole the Norco. He is apparently a recovering addict who has been clean less than a year. We obviously didn't know this. He has now vanished. His work hasn't heard from him, his parents haven't heard from him, and Jane hasn't heard from him. He could be on a bender or dead for all we know. Jane went to his apartment when he wasn't responding to her and that's when she found the empty pill bottle with my wife's name on it and called us screaming.

SIL blames us and is beyond pissed, which I can understand. She needs an outlet for her anger. What I don't understand is about half the family blames us too. They understand we didn't know about Bob's addiction history, but they said having unused narcotic medication just sitting around is irresponsible and we created this problem. It's causing a bit of a rift between the people blaming us and those not blaming us, and we (and my mother and father-in law) are caught in the middle because SIL has been on a rampage against us for ""destroying her life.""

I'm trying to be empathetic to Bob and SIL, but I don't agree. First, we legitimately forgot about it. Neither of us take medication regularly, and we had a newborn to deal with, so we weren't thinking about a bottle of pills in the corner of the medicine cabinet. Second, Bob didn't know the pills were unused. We don't know him and he doesn't know us. For all he knew, my wife could have a chronic condition and need those pills. It's not like he would recognize the prescribing doctor's name is an obstetrician. Am I not allowed to have medicine in my own house on the off chance that a recovering addict will come by and see it? 

I think Bob is firmly the asshole here and my wife and I don't have any responsibility. If we had known he was an addict and still left the pills out, then maybe, but we didn't know.

But, I don't have any experience with addiction or even taking narcotic pain meds, so maybe I am the asshole for not being more diligent about getting rid of the pills. 

AITA?

EDIT: Thanks all. 

I'm glad my initial reaction wasn't off base.

AITA for not contributing to my older brother's wedding?,"UPDATE:  Let me start by saying that I truly appreciate everyone who took the time to comment amd message me. You guys are all.awesome.

So my stepmom wanted to talk to me and she and I had a chat yesterday. 
The first thing she said was that my brother wanted to get together and talk this out. Which we did today. More on that later....
My stepmom told me that she and my dad had seen FSIL act like a brat a few times towards my brother but never anything like that night at dinner. 

My dad told my brother that what happened was completely ridiculous and both he and her owed me major apologies. He also let my brother know that he now has apprehensions about my brother getting married to her. And he wanted my brother to really think about what he wanted.  And that if he decided to marry her anyway, he doesn't know how much of our family would attend. 

My Dad did apologize to me if I felt like he didn't defend me to her. He just said that he was so shocked about what went on that he couldn't react. My Dad and I are fine.

As for my brother... Its sort of uneventful. We met for lunch at my Dads house today. When I walked in, he tried to hug me but I wasn't having it.  He did apologize. Sincerely I believe. He told me that he knew about all the wedding stuff she had prepared but  not the ""expense sheet"" and that he had told her weeks ago what his parents were willing to pay for and that she could not ask me for money. 

When I started laughing,  he knew that she didn't listen to him and he was pissed but didn't want to cause a scene in front of everyone. He went on to say that when they left, he blew up on her and she told him that she couldn't believe that he was ok with his family being so selfish and it escalated from there with her packing a bag and going to a hotel because her parents said she couldn't go to their house.

I asked him where they stood now and he just shrugged. I asked if he still wanted to marry her but before he answered, I said that I didn't care. It was his life and he could do what he wanted but I (and my daughter whom he adores) would absolutely not be there. 
And if he did marry her that our relationship would change forever. I would never ask my Dad to choose between us and that I am perfectly capable of being civil to him at family events but that was it.

I did hug him when he left and told him that I hope this all has the outcome he can live with.

And I may actually be the asshole now, but I really don't care.  I'm ok with how it ended.  
I don't want an apology from her. She means nothing to me now.

I feel like this is over and I can let it go.

Thanks again for everyone's input.


A little backstory for setup. I was widowed a little over a year ago. My husband had a substantial life insurance policy as well as a successful business that I have recently sold. I have no financial issues. I can raise my daughter without worry.

My older brother proposed to his girlfriend back in January.  She's nice and seems to love my brother. We have had no issues in the past.

Covid hit, so we haven't done family get togethers or anything. Their wedding planning has been put on hold. Until recently. Our state has slowly started opening, no one has been sick, weather has been good, so my Dad and stepmom decided to have a family dinner on their outdoor patio to discuss my brothers wedding. With my FSILs parents in attendance so they could all get on the same page.

I tried to dip out because wedding planning isn't my thing (I eloped) but was told my presence was requested by FSIL. My step mom said she thought I was going to be asked to be a bridesmaid. (Which would have been a NO but that's beside the point).

Dinner was uneventful but afterwards my FSIL pulls out a 3 ring binder and starts handing out ""information packets"" about her wedding. 
When and where she wanted it, pictures of dresses she was considering, colors, ideas for catering, pictures of cakes, everything a well prepared bride could come up with.

My favorite page was the list of expenses. How much she expected everyone to contribute. Her Dad, her mom and stepdad, my dad and stepmom, my brothers Mom, and ME. I said ""You expect me to contribute? That's hilarious"" I was met with a stern gaze from my brother. ""Oh my God, you're serious. Yeah, that's not happening""

Cue the meltdown from the bride to be. Her Dad speaks up and tells her that she was already told that combined between both him and her Mom and Stepdad, she would be given $70,000 to do what she wanted. Just like they did for her sister. She started crying. My dad chimes in and says ""Yeah, between the 3 of us, we will pay for a nice rehearsal dinner for like 30 people and an open beer and wine bar at the reception. That's it."" She started screaming. Like holding her hands over her ears and screaming"" Why is everyone trying to ruin my life? ""

So I said ""This is where I leave"" She stands up and comes to me and gets in my face, telling me how it's all my fault.I have money so I should be willing to spend it on her because she's going to be ""family"".

I just laughed,looked at my brother and said ""Good luck with all that"" and walked out. My FSIL blew my phone up for 2 days, calling me names and telling me how awful I am. I haven't talked to my brother but my Dad said the wedding planning has been put on hold while she reevaluates whether she wants to marry into a selfish family.  LMAO

I know in my heart I'm NTA but a friend seems to think I should contribute just to keep the peace. Which I don't really care about at this point and my Dad and stepmom agree with me. My other siblings do too but are trying to stay 
out of it.

EDIT: Because people keep asking 
On top of the 70k her parents were willing to contribute, she wanted 50k from my Dad and Brother's Mom snd 30k from me. Yes, $150k for a wedding.
Also, I think she had originally asked her parents for $80,000

EDIT 2: This post blew up. I.didnt expect it to. I just wanted to show My friend thate ""keeping the peace"" was not a good idea. Thank you for all your replies. Even the one that called me a narcissist and said I should contribute. 

My stepmom says she has some things to telle either tomorrow or Wednesday, whenever we can catch up. So.if there is anything to update I DEFINITELY will.

EDIT 3: I turned notifications off. I honestly didn't expect this to blow up like it did.  I will update when I have something.
To the commenters saying I.probably could have been nicer when this happened, I can appreciate that. However I was taken by surprise and being nice was the furthest thing from my mind. I showed a great deal.of restraint because her parents were there and I had never met them before. If they hadn't been there would have been a lot of cursing. A LOT.

Also to the ones who messaged me and asked, my daughter was spending some time with my inlaws. She hadn't seen them much since lockdown began except over video chat. If she had been home, I probably wouldn't have gone at all.",Not the A-hole
AITA For telling my ex-husband's soon to be ex-wife that I (and by extension my daughter) will have no relationship with her?,"I'll try to keep it short and sweet. My ex-husband cheated on me with his current wife. We divorced, they got together, and had a baby.

Well it's some years past that point, and surprise surprise, he's done it again. He and his wife are getting a divorce, and he's probably going to marry his new affair partner within the next 6 months if he follows the pattern. More power to him and his penis, I literally do not care what he does with his life anymore.

BUT I was pretty shocked to discover that his wife reached out to me, basically crying about what happened, how she couldn't believe it, and how now that we're in the same camp, so to speak, we should maintain a relationship so our daughters can still be in each other's lives and so we can commiserate.

Yeah, I told her to take a hike, and that if our mutual ex wanted our daughters to hang out, I was more than happy to schedule his visitation at the same time as hers so the girls could be together with their father, but that there was no way I was setting up sleepovers and playdates with her. I'm not bitter about it anymore, I'm remarried, etc. But I just want nothing to do with her. Haven't since the affair.

She about lost it, crying even more about how I would keep our girls apart because we both know ex-husband barely keeps up with his visitation, blah blah, and how he gets when he's in a new relationship. Yes, NOW we both know. But before only I knew, and she didn't seem too sympathetic about my end. She brought up how when she started up with my ex, she didn't know he was married, so I shouldn't hold it against her, and he's the one who cheated, not her. But I really don't care about any of that.

Anyway, she obviously called me an asshole, though not in so many words. My sister is also saying I should think about my daughter's potential relationship with her half sibling, but I think that should be on her father to orchestrate if it's important for him that his children bond and have a relationship. So lay it on me. AITA?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Popular questions, my daughter is 8 almost 9, and her daughter is close to 7, either about to turn or just turned. My daughter is completely indifferent to her half-sister on her dad's side for various reasons explained in the comments but suffice to say, the indifference isn't new. They don't and have never had a sisterly relationship according to my daughter. She does not have any specific desire to see her (but is presumably fine seeing her while they are both with their father), but if she did want to hang out with her, we'd make it happen.

**EDIT:** Also asked about the state of schedule. My daughter sees her father, generously, 8-10 times a year, never more than a week, usually for a day or two. Between 2-4 of those are with his wife and daughter. This is likely to decrease slightly since he's in a new relationship. Assuming the same pattern continues, the girls will probably still see each other at least 3 times a year. A bit in the summer, for one fall holiday, and father's day. I have also encouraged her in the past to attend his daughter's birthday parties at least briefly.

My daughter is very close with my other daughter and her stepfather, which likely contributes to her disinterest, but isn't something I can really control. I've never badmouthed her father, his wife or other sister, but they just don't really sit prominently on our day-to-day radar.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I kick my boyfriend out of my house over chicken.,"I love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. I moved into my current house last year after I got a dog, specifically because I wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. I bought her doggy door, and she loved it A few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. He eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. That was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. So then the chickens had monitored outside time. Then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. He keeps her locked in her cage all day when I'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. She can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. He's even started scolding me even when I let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if I'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.

&#x200B;

It's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. He doesn't even pay rent on my house. He refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. When I remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. When I suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.

&#x200B;

At this point I think the only thing I can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. I know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. WIBTA if I asked him to move out?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Okay, wow, I got way more responses then I ever dreamed of. I've been trying to read through them all. I feel like despite most saying I would N be TA. I think I agree with the people saying that kicking him out is too extreme. My birthday is next week, I think I'm going to ask if we could build some sort of containment for the chickens for it. Also, yes I know I am a human doormat. Been my whole life, I'm working through it in therapy.",Not the A-hole
AITA for /how/ I told someone I would not give up my handicap spot?,"This is a throwaway account.

&#x200B;

For background, I (22F) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess I have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, I had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. Though, I have a handicap placard not just because I had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

I’m not asking AITA for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what I said. My brother thinks I went too far, but I think I afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200B;

I was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) I pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. We waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. I got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200B;

The woman immediately started berating me, saying I had no right to use the handicap spot as other people “that actually need it” would be unable to park. Apparently, I am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn’t know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. She called me an entitled brat and accused me of “scamming the government to support \[my\] lazy ass,” among other things. I told her a doctor saw fit I get a handicap placard, and when she said I look “fine” I told her that my medical history is none of her business. She continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

&#x200B;

I eventually had enough and let her have it. I told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn’t eat yourself into debilitating obesity others ‘that actually need it’ would be able to use your spot. She tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which I cut her off to say if she’s going to make assumptions about me I will do the same. I called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. She threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and I told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

&#x200B;

When my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. He said something like calm down and let's go inside, and I said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. Then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. She either didn’t call the police or they refused to come.

&#x200B;

I know what I said was harsh but I’m pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. Maybe I should regret it, but I don’t have an ounce of remorse for what I said. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being ok with my parents( and family) not attending my wedding because they won’t accept my friend,"UPDATE: First off I want to say thank you for all the lovely comments, and for people taking the time to weigh in! I tried to keep up with them all and I just couldn’t, so I’m so sorry if I couldn’t get to your comment! 

Just to be very clear, I was not asking if I am asshole for standing up for my friend, I stand by my actions 100%. I am trying to figure out if I should have done more to convince my parents to come rather than simply accepting they won’t be there. 

I am going to take the advice many of you have suggested and have another sit down with my parents and reiterate my feelings. I will be firm with them and remind them that they are welcome to come but that if they do I expect them to be kind and courteous to all!


I will do an update when I speak to them, thank you again reddit x

____________________

I (28F) am marrying my fiancé (32M) in March.

I was in my parents home recently and I was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. For some background. This male friend, we’ll call him Stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. My fiancé said he’d love to have Stephen as a groomsman, and i asked Stephen and he was delighted!

Then, I told my parents, and they were like “oh we didn’t realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. She’ll be in all the photographs, we don’t think that’s appropriate”  So I was obviously instantly mad.They then said that they weren’t going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that I would need to remove Stephen from the wedding party if I wanted them to come to the wedding. 

So I basically told them that if they weren’t comfortable they didn’t have to come. I left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. I then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if I remove Stephen. Basically bribing us. I just told her I needed space and I hung up.

That was 3 days ago and I haven’t spoken to them. I’m shocked because they have never spoken ill of Stephen before,! I’m upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. I am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think I would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

I don’t know if I should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if I should leave it to them. A few people I’ve spoken to have said I’m being a bit of an asshole because they’re my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it’s something I don’t agree with. That I’ll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. I’ve had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and I’m being selfish. A cousin texted me to say that I’m choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won’t be attending if my parents aren’t, and the same for other members of the family. So it’s basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

My view is that I don’t think it’s selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone I love. I feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

Also to be clear I am 100% not removing Stephen from my wedding or taking the money, I’m not considering either option (my fiancé is in full agreement). But I just want to know if I’m the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won’t be coming to my wedding?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for telling a girl that she’s not “just being honest”, she’s just being a bitch?","This just happened at lunch earlier and my one friend is telling me I went too far and making me second guess myself.  

There’s this girl who is sort of part of my group of friends, but not really.  She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that’s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she’s very insulting, all the time.  It’s seriously like she doesn’t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says “I’m just being honest” a lot. The problem is that she can’t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it’s about her.  

Today at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  “Are you sure you’re not trans?  I’ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.”  And then, “It’s not attractive. Just being honest.”   So I said, “You’re not just being honest, you’re being a bitch.”  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, “No one thinks you’re funny.  The only thing that’s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.”  

No one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went too far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  ",Not the A-hole
"AITA for leaving a dental appointment and leaving a ""mean"" review on every site humanly possible after the way I was treated?","This is really hard for me to share. I have purging disorder. It's like bulimia but no binge. I'm 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse ""bulemia"" and ""bullemia"") and gets dismissive. 

I've been purge free for the first time since I was 10. I hadn't been to a dentist since I was 12. Well obviously, my teeth are fucked. Now when I made the appointment I was clear that it's been a long time since I'd been to a dentist and have an eating disorder, and asked if I could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for me. They said of course, they understand.

When I had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said ""Let me guess, you're bulimic?""

I started to say ""No, I have purging disorder"" and she cut me off as soon as I said no and said something like ""Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff I don't remember/understand.""

I said ""No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--"" she cut me off and said ""It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y.""

I said ""IT'S PURGING DISORDER"" because I thought if I said ""no"" again she would catapult me. 

She said ""Okay, sure, ""purging disorder"""" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.

I'm not proud of it but I started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for me. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when I calmed down. Instead of calming down, I just got my things and left without paying anything. I cried in my car but shook it off and ended up going home. 

When I got home I was still really upset and so I started writing reviews left and right about the situation. I think I left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, I got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched my name with my appointment and was wanted to discuss my reviews and how I was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.

I said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with me that it wasn't going to change anything or fix my teeth. I lied and said that I had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat me with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to me and tried to pretend they worked with me to figure it out.

I've talked about this in my therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling me I'm wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but I shouldn't take it out on them.

"AItA for refusing my MIL's offer of ""free"" childcare?","Throwaway due to the specificity of the details. 

My MIL has offered to provide childcare for my son, her grandson, for one year (from approx. 5 months of age until 17 months).  The stipulation is that my wife and I provide her with an apartment in which she will live for those 12 months.  I've offered our home up to her, but she refused and stated that she would like an apartment in order to have her own space.  

We live in a fairly particular part of Pennsylvania where the winters can be fairly severe and the summers equally so.  I just don't see the necessity of paying our mortgage and a monthly rent on someone else's apartment. When adding up the cost of the apartment, the probable utilities payments, and whatever outings she decides to take my son on, it seems very likely that this arrangement would be either close to or more expensive than the cost of a legitimate and licensed childcare business, of which we have several reputable options nearby.  

My wife and I disagree on the matter.  She wants to provide her mother with the apartment, I would like to again offer up our home before most likely ending up saying ""Thanks, but no thanks.""

"AITA for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?","I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

"AITA for eating my all of wife's toblerone, then buying a new one?","Yesterday a mutual friend came over and gave her a gift of a Toblerone from his holiday in Switzerland. She agreed I could have some so I did. She's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of an almost full packet.

She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back. 

She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances.

Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland.

WIBTA if I cancelled the adoption of my stepdaughter?,"Using throwaway 


So as the title suggests, I'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



Me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. This abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and I used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because I'm set to win in a few months.



Now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after I adopt our kid.



When I told her that I was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support I'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why I wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



For info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.



So reddit, WIBTA if I told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if I knew my wife was going to leave me after?


Edit: Wow this really blew up. To give answers to some repeated questions/comments:

Yes I know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and I will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.


Edit 2: Went out for a few drinks because I needed them because of all of this. 


Wife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.


I was originally leaning towards adoption because I love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms I've decided to talk to a lawyer when I get home to make an informed decision.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us?,"My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.

Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.

It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",Asshole
"AITA for telling my daughter her ""child"" is not really my ""grandchild""?","My daughter (28) has gotten into DPS and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child. 

I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? 

AITA?

Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. 

I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. 

Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.

Another edit: I accept judgment as I said about my actions... but I stand by my matching flannel idea. You should try a cheesy matching shirt photo, they're goofy memories to look back on.",Asshole
AITA for wanting to change my name and blowing up at my parents after they took the money that I saved for it?,"I've always hated my name because it's really uncommon and my teachers and even some of my friends pronounce it incorrectly (even after several corrections). I eventually got sick of it and researched legal name changes and the procedures and decided to save up for a name change after asking my mum and dad (to which they answered yes).

Last week I told my parents that I'd saved up $300 from chores and my birthday money. I told them that it's more than enough for the name change with post, handling etc. and they told me how proud they were about me being able to handle money like that.

Beginning of this week, I gathered up almost all the ID that I needed and put it in a folder. I couldn't find the envelope with my money so I started asking my parents and they told me they hadn't seen it. I looked all around the house and couldn't find the money. The entire time, my parents just sat there watching me and didn't help look for it when I asked. In the end I just gave up and thought it would turn up some time or another.

This morning my parents took me aside and told me that they needed to tell me something. They said that we'd be going to a ski resort (EDIT: caravan park\*) in a few week's time, and that they'd used my money to pay for some of it because ""we all need to do our bit because we're a bit tight on money right now"". I was furious. I started shouting at them for taking my savings without telling me and using it for something that we didn't even need. They argued that I'm an ungrateful bitch for wanting to change my name that they'd chosen for their little girl and that I'd grown up with it and never complained until now. I left the room and took a walk, during which my parents proceeded to text all our relatives and friends about the incident.

I came back to find my phone blowing up with 200+ messages from my aunts and uncles telling me I should apologise for being so petty and thankless. I have no idea what to do and I haven't talked to my parents since then. So reddit, AITA?

Edit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up but, today I asked my parents about cancelling the trip or at least paying me back and they told me they'd ""pay me back with gift cards"". I thought I'll take what I can get and apologised for shouting at them yesterday. I've decided to save up again but be much more cautious with my money and I definitely don't trust them anymore.

"AITA for being mad at my husband for asking if his friends can come over tonight, but today is my birthday.","So, my birthday is today and I haven’t seen my husband all day. I’m 29 weeks pregnant and had an early morning appointment I had to go to his morning and by the time I got home he left for work. I thought he would have something planned for tonight when he got home but he texted me and said “he can my friends come over tonight”. Which made me mad because it’s my birthday so why would you friends come over, clearly you don’t plan on doing anything with me and you haven’t seen me all day. He says I’m mad for no reason. His friends come over twice a week, normally at 10 pm and stay til 6 am. I’m upset because he has no birthday gift for me, says he ordered edible arrangements but they left my order at the store and so they are just gonna refund him his money. So I thought he’d do something tonight for me. He then says he will get me cake and then two seconds later text “so awkward but my friends didn’t get my text about how they can’t come over and they already purchased everything for the hookah. What do you want to do”. Now I’m mad again because what was the point of this long conversation. Just to bring up your friends again and ask me what I want to do.

WIBTA if I (f28) got steralised against my fiancé's wishes?,"My fiance (31m) and I (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. Last year I had a stillborn baby daughter. I said I never wanted to be pregnant again. It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. 

Apparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.

I hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.

In the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.
I hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. 

Anyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.
He is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. 

He says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

WIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?

Also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

Edit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
Just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

Fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

This past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.

He's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

I know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

If I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. 

His main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. 

And I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
So far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx

Edit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
Leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. We can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to fund a friend’s lavish birthday party?,"I am aware the title screams NTA but believe it or not, people think I’m the AH in this situation and it’s divided my friend group with more people being against me than on my side.

Background: i (26F) come from a well off family. My grandma (76) before she retired had a high paying job in the fashion industry. She wasn’t a designer or anything or well known on a world scale but she was known within the fashion circles. My grandpa (77) before he retired worked behind the scenes in the art industry so the two of their incomes combined was in the millions. They could provide for my mom and my aunt with no worries but they didn’t grow up spoiled. My grandparents taught my mom and aunt the value of money and whilst the family was effectively rich, they didn’t buy anything designer or any extravagant purchases. The most my mom and aunt spent on anything was buying houses outright and setting up inheritances for me and my cousins.

When I was old enough, I received quite a lot of money as an inheritance from my grandparents, a few million to say the least. I put all that money into a savings fund for my future and the most I spent was buying a new car when I was 19 which is the car I’m still driving 7 years later. Then, my mom died suddenly when I was 21 and I’m an only child, so I inherited even more money, our house and so on. I do not buy fancy stuff or expensive stuff. I quite happily shop at stores where the general public go as I don’t need extravagant designer labels to be happy. I also don’t really talk about my finances as it’s nobody’s business.

About two months ago, I had a few friends over and by sheer “accident” (I use that lightly), two of them found one of my bank statements. It was upstairs in my bedroom so I no for a fact they were snooping. I was pissed at them and I had to reveal my finances when they saw how much money I had. They were annoyed I didn’t tell them and I said it’s none of their business.

Now, I have a problem. It’s one of their birthdays soon and they want a HUGE party. I said that was cool and then they dropped a bombshell saying I should pay for it as I’m loaded. I was greatly offended and said why would I pay for someone’s party. It’s caused a massive rift with people accusing me of being selfish and hoarding all this money which I’m probably never going to touch. I told them that that’s MY money and I’m saving it for my future and any future family I may have and I’ve been labelled an AH.

Update: someone mentioned maybe my friends suspected that’s why they were snooping. Maybe they had questions after I got a lot after my mom died. I never disclosed anything to them as it was private but it was hard to hide I had a whole house I owned suddenly. I also am able to work a lot less hours than them so maybe they’ve always wondered how ibe managed to survive on a “low income”

Update 2: I should add my grandparents are still alive. The inheritance I got from them was money they’d saved for me for when I was of age.

Update 3: to those saying I’m an AH for my views on marriage. I would NEVER get a joint bank account. I think it’s only fair you both hold onto your money, don’t share and the only time technical sharing should come up is if you’re both paying half of whatever. Also I don’t ever wanna get married to those who decides to berate me for my view on marriage and getting offended why I didn’t have a reason for not wanting to get married. I also don’t understand why people are getting so annoyed that I wouldn’t share my money with an SO. The simple reasoning for that is I do not want an SO or a life partnership. I’m content remaining single. I also would like a future family one day not that I need to mention that and will probably go the adoption or donor dad route.

Update 4: I also checked my bank accounts and changed my security up as a precaution so nothing was taken. As for the paper statements, I am one of the few people who does like to have paper copies of my accounts. And yes, I do plan on cutting these friends out. I just wanted some honest to god insight into this situation as it’s incredibly frustrating and on another level, I’m losing most of my friends I’ve known for years so it’s really upsetting me.

Update 5: it was also brought up why I never disclosed I was this well off to my close friends. Yes I could have told them and never mentioned exact figures but that info is deeply private. They never mentioned their situations and I never thought to ask as finances are nobody’s business but your own. I have no obligation to tell anyone how much money I have or how well off I am.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my friend that he needs to go outside more if he was “traumatized” by watching people play card against humanity,"In my 12th grade economics class a group of people were playing cards against humanity cause it’s the last day before Christmas break we’re doing anything else might as well. Me and my friend weren’t playing but instead watched what people put out. 

I thought what they put was funny and even helped people pick out their cards. My friend also watched but had the opposite reaction of me. He would frequently object what people picked out sometimes got mad at me for being invested in the game.

When I help a guy picked two cards for something that basically said “combined together these two can make good profits” and chose make a wish and grave robbing, my friend told me he was traumatized, I just told him he needed to go outside more. He didn’t talk to for the rest of the day.

Additional info: the group had permission from the teacher so long as they weren’t loud or forced people who were uncomfortable to play. My friend goes to church but isn’t too extremely religious and hasn’t told me of anything in his past that would cause him to be triggered by the game even when I confessed to being abused as child.

"AITA for ""allowing"" my 16yo daughter to get a tattoo?","My daughter is 16, and will be 17 in August.  In September, I'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting College at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated HS a year earlier than her peers).  

&#x200B;

Last week my daughter graduated HS.  We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.  A few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend Tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  I was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.  I haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  To see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200B;

Of course the next day she posts pics online, and her Mom flips her shit.  She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.  She has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about Daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and I'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200B;

Obviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""I'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  I definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  Wife has been OK with her having sex since 13, picked her own High School and College, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  Why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  Would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200B;

Mom is livid.  She threatened to call the police.  Threatened to pick up Daughter and bring her back to her house.  Tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  None of this is happening.  A culture was created in which I don't get input on things regarding Daughter.  A culture was created in which Mom allowed Daughter to make decisions for herself.

AITA for refusing to split my college fund(s) with my stepsister?,"My mom passed away when I was 10. My parents were already divorced at this point, so I was the sole beneficiary of her estate, so I have a trust fund which my granddad manages for me until I turn 25 (I’m currently 18). As a part of the trust, my mother left me behind some money to pay for college which I will be getting access to soon.  

My dad remarried my stepmother shortly after his divorce with my mother and she has two daughters (Hannah, 16 and Emma, 18). Since my mom passed, I’ve been living with my dad full time and spend school holidays with my grandparents. For the first few years, things were okay but then my stepsisters started to complain about my time with my grandparents (because they took me and my cousins on fancy international trips and they were jealous) and my dad started trying to force me to limit contact with them. My grandparents ended up threatening to sue my dad for grandparents’ rights so he stopped, instead he started refusing to give me permission to fly abroad and wouldn’t let me keep all of the gifts my grandparents bought me.

Recently, my dad and stepmom sat me and Emma down and informed us that they wouldn’t be able to help us with college because they’d run into some financial trouble a few years ago and had to use the money to keep us afloat. Emma was devastated and when I didn’t have the same reaction, my dad asked me why I wasn’t upset. I explained that I still have the money mom left me, that my grandparents also had a separate college fund for me and that my aunts and uncle (mom’s siblings) also had smaller college funds for me. My aunt on my dad’s side also gave me $5k as a high school graduation gift/money for college so I should be able to complete my degree without needing to get any loans as long as I work part-time too. My dad already knew about the money my mom left me but he had no idea about the rest. 

Emma and my stepmom started insisting I had to share the college funds with Emma, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair. I refused, this is my mom’s family’s money so I don’t think I should share with someone who isn’t even related to them. My stepmom started screaming at me and calling me ungrateful for all of the things she’s done for me and that she was going to sue me for all of the money she spent on me growing up. My dad got angry with her and told her to stop and now they’re not speaking to each other. He said he’s happy that I’ll be able to go to college without any debts but if I would please consider giving her at least one of the smaller funds.

Since then, Emma and Hannah have been horrible to me. My stepmom keeps forcing me to do all of Emma’s chores and Hannah said if our parents divorce it’ll be all of my fault for being a greed b\*\*\*h.

AITA for throwing away my husband's Xbox after he refused to look for our lost dog?,"This is going to be a little long. Please try to bear with me and understand my situation. Thank you.

For starters, I am a nurse (35F) I have been extremely busy these past three months, even writing this post is a privilege and I am having to do this in bits and pieces. I also gave birth to my daughter 6 months ago. I have an eight year old son as well. When I am not working, I take care of my children. 

In January 2019, my son suddenly developed this strong desire to have a dog. He begged and begged for a puppy from my husband (35M). I protested against that because I had just found out that I was pregnant.

Jesus. My husband said that we should let our son have a puppy to teach him some responsibility and that he would have some practice to take care of his baby sibling. He had also promised that he would help our son take care of the dog. 
I was absolutely unconvinced but I had to give in eventually because my husband had already agreed and I didn't want to cause further fights. 

5 days ago, my son had accidentally left the back door of our house open and the dog ran away. These 5 days were also some of the busiest, most gruelling days of my work and I had to take up night shifts because a colleague had fallen sick. 

Our son first went to my husband for help, he refused to help him and said that it was his (my son's) responsibility to care for the and he has to do something about it himself. 

My husband has the privilege of working from home, he works at a law firm. He works for maybe 3-4 hours a day and plays Xbox the entire time and sometimes gets up to check up on our daughter. He literally has no added pressures. 

5 days ago, when our son told me in tears that ""dad won't look for Tippy"", I talked to my husband, who said that it would teach our son some responsibility to take care of things in the future, which I found very callous since a dog is a living, sentient being and not a ""thing"". He was playing Xbox when I was talking to him as well. He also said he won't look for the dog or anything. 

Yesterday, after coming home at night, the first thing I did was unplug the Xbox console and controller and throw it in the trash can.

This morning, before going to work, my husband threw a fit when he didn't find his Xbox in the living room. I told him that I'd thrown it away because he was so addicted to it that he couldn't even get up and help our distressed son. 

When I came back from work, he told me he had found his Xbox in the trash since the garbage truck hadn't arrived then. Now, he's being incredibly snarky, giving me the cold shoulder and he's angry because his controller isn't working. He also hasn't taken any measures to look for our dog and our mutual best friend called and said my reaction was incredibly childish. 

Now I am spending my free day calling every neighbour of ours, making internet posters and contacting animal shelters and Animal Control to see if Tippy had turned up anywhere and consoling my heartbroken son.

AITA?

Edit: My husband is a lawyer. A lawyer's job depends on how many clients he has. My husband currently has almost no clients due to obvious reasons (he told me this himself). So his workload is significantly less.

This is for all those people who're saying that I am downplaying his work.

**Update**: Tippy still hasn't been found yet. My shift has ended about 30 minutes ago and I'll go home and drive around in my neighborhood and surrounding areas to look for him. I have posted some pictures of Tippy on my profile, for those who requested. Husband is still sulking about his controller. I am at my wit's end.

I respect her desire to help and I told her: “This is your body, and I don’t think I have a say in what you can or can’t do with it. That being said, if you want to be the surrogate for him, I don’t think I would want to continue this relationship any further.”",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to allow my daughter to participate in High School cheerleading?,"I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.

Now my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

&#x200B;

I said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.

AITA for kissing my ex-girlfriend before her parents pulled her off life support?,"About a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (I'll call Anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. She received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). She had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

After months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained. Her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that I shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (I am 20yo). So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. 

A few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""I love you). 

At the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again ""I love you.""

After the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said ""I love you, Anna."" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again. The kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, I wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

AITA for not caring when my friend came out of the closet?,"My friend is obviously gay. He does nails with the girls, he follows make-up tutorials on YouTube, speaks in a higher tone of voice, and flails around a lot. He also gushes with the girls in our group when they bring up K-Pop celebs (guys) and joins them for shopping when we split up at the mall.

We (the guys) know he's gay, the girls most certainly do, and it's pretty much an open secret at this point. Nobody ever brings it up, and we basically just treat him like another girl.

So we're at school, it's lunchtime and we're all chilling in the cafeteria. He suddenly comes out of the closet and announces (to the guy-table) that he's gay. We're playing cards at the time, and our responses ranged from: ""Cool,"", to ""Finally...,""

Well APPARENTLY, we didn't show enough support because he seemed upset that we weren't caught completely by surprise.

Him: Why can't you people just accept me for who I am?

(We stare at each in confusion)

Me: Uh... we don't care. You're gay? Fine. It's none of our business. (shrug)

Him: It's 2019. It's not okay to hate on gay people anymore. (he storms off)

Girl 1: (kicks my leg) What the hell's your problem?

Me: Everybody already knew he was gay.

Girl 1: SOOOO??? You could've showed that you were happy for him! GOD! (kicks my leg again)

Me: Kick me again, I dare you. (Spoiler: she doesn't)

The guys at the table give me a mixed bag of: ""You done fucked up now boi /s"" and ""SHUT UP, LET'S PLAY. LUNCH IS ALMOST OVER""

Nobody ever gave him crap for being gay, and as far I know, nobody outside our group ever gave him crap for it either.

AITA for 'outing' my ex as a father?,"My ex, Josh, and I have a five year old son, Alex. We split when Alex was a year old, and we decided I'd have primary custody because he moved in with a bunch of roommates, but he asked to have Alex every other weekend.

Well, Josh paid child support, but he kept making excuses every weekend as to why he couldn't have Alex overnight (roommates having a party, his friend needed help moving, roommates having guests, his sister was in town, etc.) and after the first six months or so, I just stopped bugging him about it and he just stopped even making excuses. He didn't see Alex at all from ages 2-4.

Last year, his roommate situation changed, he distanced himself from his toxic friend group, and his parents were putting pressure on him, so Josh asked if he could have Alex for one weekend a month. After setting up some playdates to make sure Alex was comfortable with him (since he was basically a stranger at this point), we went ahead with that plan. And it's been great, Alex loves his dad and they have a great time together, and Josh expressed interest in having him over more weekends now. It's also been nice to have some 'time off' being a single mom. Great. Good news.

Except... I'm not a big social media person, but I checked Facebook in December and noticed that Josh has been posting a lot of pictures of Alex over the last year... and he never indicated that Alex was his son. He keeps calling him his 'friend' or 'his little buddy.' Someone even asked who Alex was and he said, ""He's my little bud!"" Something about this rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like I've been incredibly 'chill' about this process, maybe moreso than I should have, but the fact that he isn't even claiming Alex as his son is really shitty. I was worried he wasn't even telling his friends that this was his kid.

So, next time he posted Alex, I commented basically saying, 'I'm glad Alex is having a great time with his dad!' and proved my hypothesis; everyone was like, 'You have a kid???' 'This is your kid???' 'You never mentioned having a kid!'

Josh was furious at me, deleted the post when he saw it, and basically said it's his business to tell his friends and social circle about his life. My sister also said I was being petty, but she said I have an excuse because he's been so absent. Was it an asshole move to 'out' him like this?

EDIT: Just want to note a couple of things here. Our son was planned. He wasn't an 'oops' baby that Josh didn't want or didn't know was coming. I think people saying that he needs time to 'get used' to being a father should keep that in mind. 

Also, he and Alex have now been spending weekends together alone since last July, and had been hanging out with me present since April of last year, if the timeline wasn't clear. This isn't the first few weeks of their reacquaintance.

AITA for calling my cousins ex wife on her BS?,"My family all says I am being an asshole for this but I think they are just too non confrontational but I will leave it to the internet to decide so here is the story.

Background 9 years ago my cousin got married to his his highschool sweetheart after she graduated community college. They had been living together and my cousin did not go to college as he was supporting her through college. She is accepted into a  school in (no fault state) so off they move. They have a child which He takes care of and works nights to send his wife to school. In her final years she gets a job in her field under one of her professors.  Right after graduation she tells him that she wants a divorce she has been sleeping with her boss/professor for 2 years and now that she is no longer her teacher he is leaving his wife and they are getting married. ending their 7 year marriage. I was not informed of any of this to call her out at the time I was never actually told of the divorce just my parents told me to save the date for same cousins marriage then they told me what went down

So comes our story cousin was having a rough time of it after the divorce but eventually ran into his middle school crush they hit it off. They invite family to second wedding and put an engagement announcement on facebook. Bitch Ex wife sees the announcement and post, ""He is such a bad father He did not even ask his child if it was okay for him to get married again how will this affect her?""

so I responded in a PM ""Did you ask kidsname if it was okay with them if you cheated on daddy and  slept with your boss then divorce daddy? how do you think that will affect her?""

family is mad when she contacted them. am i the asshole?

Thanks everyone I tend to be impulsive and stand my ground (I have litiraly out suborned a mule) but second guess myself later especially when I am being told that I was in the wrong so repeatedly. my parents don't think i was wrong just should not have said anything. my grandmother also gets on to me but I don't blame her they keep reminding her of what i said and she has dementia and still thinks they are married when she is lucid enough to think.

AITA for refusing to meet my half sister who was a result of my dads affair?,"Mom and pops were married for 30ish years. I’m 26. Always thought they were a dream couple until 5 years ago when I found out that my dad had fathered a child from an affair that he had in 2006.

My dad had always been in this girls life, but over the past 5 years I guess because he had no one to keep it a secret from he’s more or less a full time dad to her. 

Since the divorce I’ve kept my distance from him, I’m just trying to secure my bag , live quietly and stay away from drama. 

He has lately started up this crusade of me meeting this girl and developing a brotherly bond with her. I told him It’s just not on the cards, I have no interest in picking up a relationship with anybody and I have my own hatred for my fathers new family and idc what anyone says, therapy ain’t fixing that. Believe me, I’ve tried. It’s better for my mental health if I continue to do my thing and not involve myself. 

It’s got to a point where everyone on my paternal side is bugging me for some sort of Christmas miracle meet up, apparently this girl wants to know me very much and is begging that she gets to meet me as a Christmas present. I’ve consistently told everybody ‘no’ and I’m also not celebrating Christmas with them in case they try force anything.

I told her the next day what I saw and she came out to me, I told her it was okay and that this wouldn't change anything in our relationship, I suggested she tell her mom/my wife, she said she would tell her one day when she is ready but I should keep it a secret

I asked her why she didn't want to tell her she said, her mom has a big mouth and she didn't want other people to know especially her grandparents(my wife's parents are homophobic) so I just let it be and kept the secret as it wasn't my secret to tell.

Well my wife recently found out when my daughter brought her long term girlfriend home who is now her fiancee to introduce her to my wife (I've known about this girl since they started dating, even met her parents), my wife got angry and asked our daughter why she kept this secret from her parents?

AITA For telling my girlfriend her best friend can't stay with us in my house and kicking my girlfriend out when I came home to her in my house,"Throwaway and not English, so keep that in mind.

I will try to keep this short

My girlfriend recently asked to move in with me since her lease was running out and the landlord did not want to renew it and given she makes a little above minimum wage in my country finding a rental place is semi impossible for her(If you make minimum wage or on welfare government rental housing is available if not and you are between minimum wage and middle wage you are screwed.), so it was move back to her parents or move in with me. While I was reluctant given we have only been together for a year, I love her and let her move in. I inherited money from my uncle which I used to buy my own house.

It has been going really well, until yesterday when she asked me if her best friend could move in for a while. Now this best friend of hers is a mess to put it bluntly, she can hardly keep a job, drinks enough to pass out at least once a week, smokes weed inside, got kicked out of her place for not paying rent etc. So obviously my answer was no, she retorted by saying it would just be fir a few weeks, to which I said even if it was fir a day it would be a no, she got mad saying I did not care about her friend and I shrugged andagreed saying I indeed do not care about her friend, she us her friend not my friend.

Well this turned in to a huge fight where she tried to have me sleep on the couch, I told her I was not sleeping on the couch in my own home and if she wanted to sleep somewhere else, she is welcome too.

Today I went to work and she had the day off, our argument was unresolved but she was still asleep so I did not feel like waking her up and arguing. When I got home 9 hours later I see a load of suitcases in the hallway, confused I walk in to the living room and ammet with her, her best friend and her best friends boyfriend. Her best friend immediatly comes over to thank me for letting her move in and so does the boyfriend.

I take a moment, glare at them and tell them to grab their shit and get out, after some whining they comply. My girlfriend calls me a horrible person and that they have no where to go and I tell her to join them and after a lot of arguing she grabs her stuff and gets out too.

I have since gotten multiple messages from mutual friends calling me horrible for making my girlfriend and her friend homeless so I am doubting my decision, I have plenty of room after all. Judge me. Also yes, I dumped her, before anyone asks, I am just wondering whether I overreacted and such.

EDIT: I should have done this earlier but I got overwhelmed by the amount of responses. So to answer some frequently asked questions. 1: In my experience moving in together is something you usually do when both parties are on board a long way in to your relationship, this might be cultural or personal but I don't think it is really relevant, what I deem appropriate to do at which parts of my relationship is up to me, I am not telling you, you can not move in together at 2 months either you know. 2: She moved in roughly 3 weeks ago. 3: She bought groceries once, besides that she had not contributed, nor was there an agreement on rent as this was not intended to be permanent unless we decided that later on. 4: She is not homeless, her parents live 40 minutes from me, she has a car and she is welcome there.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for leaving the United States and bringing my newborn to my home country (India) , never to return back without the telling my baby's father (my husband) ?","
I'm an Indian woman, and a new mother to my little half indian, half american baby girl. She's six months old.

The day I went into labor, I learned that my husband was having an affair with our neighbor. She's only 22 and has a myriad of mental health issues. She and my husband started an affair after she got out of rehab. I had no idea that him trying to 'help' her would involve sticking his peepee stick inside of her.

It was a traumatic day. Can't mention much here, but to put it shortly, she declared she was 3 months pregnant with my husband's child and had an emotional breakdown. 

She fainted and my husband left me alone in the hospital to take HER to another ward . He carried her in his arms in front of my own eyes.

He returned after a few hours. I had just given birth to our daughter. He took her in his arms, kissed her and left the room.

So two days go by, my husband returns finally telling me that he will have to move out because his mistress is emotionally fragile and he was the only person in the world who could support her.

He supported us financially but rarely visited. His girlfriend spent a few days in and out of the hospital. It was a continuous back and forth of her hospital visits. She gave birth prematurely and the baby spent a lot of time in the NICU, struggling between life and death. The baby was also born with a host of disabilities and conditions, which would cost them thousands of dollars in medical bills.

The last time he came to visit our daughter, he looked really distressed and emotional. That day I also overheard him talking to her on the phone. He was promising her that he would ALWAYS prioritize their baby over our baby. He also promised her that he would always love their baby over our baby because their baby was a product of love, and our baby was a product of 'duty sex'.

That day I called my parents back in India, and told them everything. They told me to come back home. I don't have family in the US. His family wasn't close to me either. I'm all alone. I came to the US on the fiance visa to marry him.

My former boss back in India got to know what happened to me, and offered me a new position, telling me that she would love to have me back.

Knowing that my baby would suffer in her father's house. I planned my escape and left the US. I'm never going back. My divorce will be official in sometime. India isn't a signatory to the Hague Child abduction convention, so technically, I haven't abducted my child. US laws don't apply in India, and we didn't have a custody order or arrangement. 

My husband is now blowing up on my phone. My parents have blocked him everywhere. Some of my friends are telling me that I ripped my baby's father out of her life and that I'm a horrible mother.

AITA for teasing my wife about finally catching her shitting?,"Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, ""See! I knew you shit too!"" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.

Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

"WIBTA for not going to my sisters wedding because of the ridiculous ""requirements""","So, i'm in the middle of a shitstorm and need some advice on if i'm wrong.

My sister is getting married in less that 3 weeks. I haven't been involved in the planning as I have my own life but from what my mom has relaid to me it's been a nightmare. My sister want's a ""fancy"" wedding and is micro-managing everything. I have no idea how normal this is but from what i've heard she broke down crying when her fiance bought the wrong shade of white napkins. Her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.

&#x200B;

In my opinion I think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. At least until yesterday. A email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with ""attendance requirements"". These requirements were a joke. Some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. But some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. The worst though were the ""gift requirements"". According to the email a gift of 300$ value or more MUST be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. The email also ends with ""Those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. Please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time""

&#x200B;

This is a joke, right? Like I can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. I called my mom to make sure this was not a late April fools joke and it was real. I told her that I won't be going because of this. That was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that I'm being selfish and that i'm ruining ""her day:.

AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?,"My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

An's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

I am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of ""terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition"", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

No, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

I will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.

Finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom.",Not the A-hole

As such, Belladonna feels she is pillar for the company and has asked to become a manager. She has tried to take on managerial roles before, but I wouldn't give her that job if someone paid me.   
She is a little snarky, but I had no issue with it. Until I caught her calling Ally ""Cinderella"" and ""Princess."" She was also ordering Ally to get her coffee. When Ally said she was working on something, Belladonna told her ""well, I guess you just sit down and do nothing then.""   
I fired her on the spot.   
My Mother thinks I was an asshole for doing that. But I don't tolerate people who think being older means they have a right to be snarky. I told people what Ally was doing at the job, and that she was not an intern. She was simply my niece assisting me on stuff I needed help with.

AITA for kicking out my new flatmate after she hid my medication?,"This happened a couple of weeks ago and im only posting this because I feel a bit guilty and then read a kinda similar post this morning that reminded me about it. 

I'm 27f, ive been taking antidepressants for around 2 years after an event in uni that gave me ptsd. If I dont take them then I turn into essentially a human Gummi bear who cant do anything except mooch around like a miserable sack of potatoes. Yes i also see a therapist for this as well. 

Anyway, my flatmate of 18months left the country to go home before covid and has now declined to return so I had to find a new flatmate. The girl that I found seemed nice, a bit weird in the typical hippy vegan way but didn't gave a problem with living with someone who eats bacon and i was having trouble finding potential flatmates and can't afford the apartment by myself. 

We agreed to a 6 week trial before she would've signed on for a year. 

Initially everything seemed fine but in the 3rd week I noticed that my anti depressants were occasionally not in the cabinet in the mirning when I woke up(I always take them at 8am before work). Often I would briefly look for them but have to rush out of the house before I could find them. They would usually be back that evening or I'd find them in the other bathroom cabinet or in the vanity next to the toilet. I asked her if she was moving them a couple of times and the first time she said no and the second she said that she was trying to find her health vitamins and had emptied the cabinets looking for them and must have forgotten to put my anti depressants back. I thought this was weird cause nothing else had moved but shrugged it off. 

In the 4th week I couldn't find them for 3 days, confronted her and she offered to help search only for her to ""find"" them in the kitchen cabinets and blamed it on me taking them into the kitchen(I never do). Beginning of the 5th week I couldn't find them again and while I was searching the apartment I saw her open bag and looked inside(yes I know im TA here), low and behold there were my pills. I confronted her that evening and she said she was trying to wean me off them and that I should stop putting that poison in my body. I told her that it wasn't going to work out and to find somewhere else to live. She threw a hissy fit and packed all her stuff that night and left(to be clear I did say she had until the end of the trial period to leave, she didn't have to go immediately). 

Anyways, 4 weeks later I have a new flatmate who seems great, but the girl has been messaging me begging to come back because the friend she's been staying with has kicked her out. Obviously I have another flatmate now so she can't move back in but AITA here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for subjecting my boyfriend to my nakedess?,"I (32F) live with my boyfriend (35M) of 5 years. We live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. As a result, our dresser is in the living room.

After work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

Angrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

Anyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??

UPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.

Thank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.

I'm also a bit obsessed with all the Seinfeld comments. Jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. Now Kramer on the other hand...

And thank you to everyone who supports my Kermit dance! I will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. But for no longer than 5 minutes. I know the rules.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting my husband kicked out of the delivery room?,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time using this platform, I'm sorry for any 'rules' broken or any mistakes made.

A friend of mine showed me this website recently, and since then I have been considering this post.

My husband and I (married for 3 years, together for 7) had our first child 3 weeks ago. She is perfect, and everything I could ever wish for, even if she is a handful. However, unfortunately, her birth was ... complicated.

I have always been a private person, and very terrified of pregnancy due to the (admittedly low, but to me nonetheless scary) risks associated. My husband knows this, and I specifically asked him, when we found out about this pregnancy, that he tried to help me lower my stress levels, since the pregnancy itself would already be causing me significant stress.

He succeeded at this during almost all of my pregnancy. He was always very calm, even when he had a bad work day and was upset. He put up with me when I cried over silly things like wanting one specific brand of food that was sold out, he made sure I was comfortable at home and rarely had to go out when I was too big to do so comfortably.

We agreed on from the start that he would be the only person in the delivery room with me. No parents, no family, no friends, just us and the medical staff.

However, on the day I was admitted to the hospital, his mother (who is usually a very, very nice lady, just has her moments) cried to him that it was unfair she would not witness the birth of this grandchild. (My husband has an older sister with two kids, and she was in the delivery room for both of them). My husband tried to get me to agree to having her in the delivery room. I said no, and figured that would be the end of it.

After a long, exhausting, painful labor, when my doctor announced my daughter was crowning, I saw the door open and my mother in law come in. No medical staff got up to stop her. My husband was next to me and I clung to his arm and told him to get her out. He tried to argue with me that she should be allowed to see the birth of her grandchild. I started panicking HARD, like I said, I am a private person and did not want my MIL staring into my lady bits while I was so vulnerable and exposed. I kept saying to my husband, ""take her outside, please, get her out of here, please, please"" but he would not budge.

A nurse finally noticed how much I was panicking and stressing and immediately shooed everyone expect me and the staff out of the room. This included my husband.

My daughter was born soon after, but because of the MIL situation, he did not get to witness the birth. He was very upset at me during the hospital stay, saying I didn't allow him to see his child be born. I feel awfully guilty because I did want my husband in there, but he should not have let his mother in. It's been almost 3 weeks since we have been back home, and he still acts coldly towards me sometimes.

AITA? I (21F) just had an abortion and my bf (29M) thinks I’m overreacting,"Hi all, I’ll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.
I  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( I’m on the pill and he wears a condom). I have no idea what happened but I still managed to get pregnant. I immediately decided to get an abortion.
I asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. He said he didn’t want to take a day off. Full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.

So whatever, he told me he wasn’t coming and that I had to take care of it. This was a week ago. The procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. I went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. I thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as I just had a tough day and was emotional at best. 
He then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.
So I immediately started bawling because I just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn’t wanted and I don’t regret it, but it doesn’t mean I feel sensitive about it). He became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that I was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. He didn’t apologize and we went to bed upset. I woke up in the middle of the night because I was cramping and sore, so I went on his couch and had a good cry. Apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if I was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights ASAP because I was being inconsiderate.

AITAH? I feel like he doesn’t give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it’s the ‘pregnancy hormones’ making me whiny.

ETA: thank you all for your judgement and messages. I’m going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. To those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn’t want it. Regardless, I want to at least understand his motivations. I will try to post an update when this is all over. Thank you again.
Also don’t waste your time calling me a baby killer, I’m 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. If you can’t understand why, then you’re not someone I want to engage with anyway.",Not the A-hole
AITA for specifically ordering food my wife hates so I don’t have to share?,"Yeah so I’m basically Joey from Friends before anyone states the obvious. I really really hate sharing food when I order out at restaurants or takeout. I always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. 

So my wife is a TERRIBLE food snatcher. She always says she’s not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food I’ve ordered. So many times I’ve ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. I ask her to order her own stuff but she’ll say she’s not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

Anyways in the past year I’ve found a good trick where I simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won’t touch any of it. Recently some family members discovered I do this and called me a massive asshole. They called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly I’m just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. AITA?

**Edit**: To those asking if I’ve told her to stop, I do, all the time, but it’s honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. Or she’ll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly “so how’s your food? It looks really good...” Or she waits until I’m taking a break to ask me multiple times if I’ve finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she’s begging for scraps. It just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.

I like just getting something she has no interest in cause then I can eat in peace, and that usually forces her to order something else for herself as well.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name even though I have one of my sons name?,"I have a tattoo of my sons name which I got when he turned 1. I’ve never had a tattoo after that. Met the love of my life 22 years ago, she had a 4 year old daughter, and I honestly truly love her like my own. 

Recently my wife’s best friend noticed my tattoo (it’s on my chest so usually covered up) and she asked my wife if I had a tattoo of my stepdaughters name. 

My wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. She told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that I should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

I don’t want to do it at all, and I keep saying no, but my wife thinks a ‘real dad’ would get tattoos of both. I got a bit upset at that comment and told her I was a real bloody dad. I asked my daughter and she said ‘I don’t want a tattoo of my name, but if you are getting a tattoo for me I want you to get a cat’ .... I love her very much but I’m not getting a freaking cat on me either. 

My wife is very sensitive about the fact that our daughter isn’t biologically mine, I absolutely 0% care as my stepfather raised me and he is the best dad in the fucking world. I love my daughter and she loves me.

Am I the asshole for refusing to get this tattoo?

EDIT: a user pointed out I should explain why I got my tattoo. I got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn’t was a medical miracle. I was celebrating the first year of his birth because that was the biggest hurdle to get through. Never saw any need to get any tattoos after that.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling strangers that my wife and I are married?,"My wife gets upset when I do this but I feel like I'm in the right here. If we are at a bar or a party, we usually go our own separate ways to socialize. I'll notice that she'll be talking to a guy that neither of us have met before and I can see on his face that he's into her. So I'll head over to where she's at and grab her, give her a kiss and compliment her. Something like ""She's so funny. That's why I married her."" Then I leave so she can continue talking. Almost every time, the guy ends up leaving after I do. She's never really flirting with these guys, just talking sports or politics. But she's beautiful and very smart and she has a knack for being very personable so they assume she is flirting. She says all she is trying to do is have a conversation with a stranger but I'll I'm doing is letting people know we are married. If it was just a conversation, they should still be able to talk to her even though she's taken. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for confronting my kids private school teacher about blue blood?,"So this happened about a year ago but I'm curious. My wife said I drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

So my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. So I was excited too and asked him what. He said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

I felt a little bad but said to him ""you know I was told that as a kid too, but I've learned that's actually not true."". I said I can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. We get home and I show him and he believes me. 

The next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. His teacher tells him no, I am the one who is wrong not him. My kid even said he believes his teacher. So I show my son more proof that I am right, but he is still skeptical.  

The next day I compose a nice email, not rude. Simply stating I told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him I am incorrect. I give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

He emails me back saying I am still incorrect. At this point my wife asks me to drop it. I am upset and I don't want to drop it. As of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

So I email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because I cannot produce anything showing he is correct. He finally relents and says I must be right. 

But at this point, I now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  My wife asked me to please stop but I didn't. I emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

He did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

Now I feel that I have taught my son a few good lessons.  A) it's ok to question things including those authorities B) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence C) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

Was I an asshole for dragging it out?

Edit. To those calling me an asshole? What is the best way to handle this then? I'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

Edit: well this blew up. I'll accept my nta. But these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? Nope. Couldn't care less. But I wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

Final edit: showed the wife this. She said that I was correct in following through. But I was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days. 
Thanks for the conversations though!",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my name pronounced the German way,"I am a 16 year old girl. My family moved from Germany to USA at the end of last year. I have been learning English since I was young because my father is originally from the US, so I don’t have to deal a language barrier Besides slang terms. 

Where I live there are a lot of immigrants coming from Asia, the Middle East, South America and other parts of North America, so my school has a program to help foreign students adjust and adapt to live and school here. Because I come from Germany, I must be apart of this program despite being fluent in English. Therefore I have a counsellor who checks in on me. 

My name is Dana. In Germany this bake is Pronounced Basically like the name Donna and not day-na. 
Some of my classmates and teachers refuse to pronounce my name the way I pronounce it even after months of asking and reminding them. So now I don’t respond when people say day-na. 

However now I have been flagged because of this. A teacher anonymously sited in the System my counsellor used that I am being rude, difficult to work with and not trying as hard as I should to intergrate and assimilate with school and social culture. 

I know that this is because I won’t let people. pronounce my name the “wrong” way. While I am reserved, I do have friends, do well in school and (when able to) involve myself in social activities in and outside of school.

AITA for sleeping outdoors in my yard? My neighbors are bothered by it.,"Ok, this is a weird one.

I've been having major cabin fever recently, working from home and generally being stuck at home, especially when the weather has been warming up. 

Getting outside helps a lot but I've mainly stayed in my own yard. I have a hammock up between two trees and I've slept in there at night under the stars. It's nice, it's peaceful, and it makes me feel a lot less like a rat in a cage nowadays. 

I know it's weird but I enjoy it. It is peaceful and helps me destress after work.

But my neighbors are bothered by it, they said it is weird, they don't want someone sleeping outdoors near where their kids play. They don't like me being out there so much because their family has less privacy, and it would be better if I stayed in the house at night.

I said I don't pay them any attention, I am just doing something relaxing to stay sane because my work and other things have made me stressed.

AITA for asking to be charged for a man's haircut when I am a woman,"I am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years I have had a short, men's style haircut. I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

Recently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.

AITA for asking? Leaving? Being annoyed at what I see as a double standard?

AITA for making drinks on my daughter’s birthday even though it made my son’s girlfriend uncomfortable?,"My son (22M) and his girlfriend, “April” (22F) live with us.  My daughter (24F) moved out but visits often. 

The other day was my daughter’s birthday and she came over for dinner. We ordered take  out, watched a movie, had a good time. She also wanted to make these drinks she found online. Here’s the issue, my April doesn’t drink. Her dad died due to an alcohol related disease and it scares her. I completely get it. But it’s my daughter’s birthday. She didn’t have to drink, we had alternatives and this is just what myself, my daughter, daughter’s fiancé and my husband were doing. 

Well, this bothered April. We weren’t getting drunk, just sipping on the deck and having a good time. My son pulled me aside and said we should stop. I said no, it was his sister’s birthday and while I feel for April, she can’t control who drinks and who doesn’t. My son got even more aggravated and he and April spent the rest of their night in their room.

The next day, April texted my daughter saying if you need alcohol to have fun, you have a problem. My daughter just sent an eye roll emoji back. I told April to mind her own business and that she doesn’t have to drink, but she can’t control others. She got really upset and said we made her uncomfortable. I said alcohol exists and if she’s that bothered by it, she needs some help. My son feels I crossed a line. My husband thinks I shouldn’t have said that either.

AITA for making a baby cry to save $100?,"Okay hear me out.

So today I took my baby over to my parents’ house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she’s home with the kid all day while I’m at work and needed a break—so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It’s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, ‘disobey a sign’ is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know…).

Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We’re home now and she’s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid’s RESP (university fund).

‘My wife was absolutely furious when she found out’ is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

WIBTA for forbidding my Father in law from seeing my kids until he stops his behavior,"My father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives. He particularly disapproves of the fact that I work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than I do. If my father in law had it his way, I would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

His recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. If I buy my husband a gift, FIL says, ""Is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" If I pay for my FIL's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" It's annoying and frustrating. I tried being snarky back, didn't work. I tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what I was talking about.

The final straw was that my kids have started saying it. I mentioned to my husband that I was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. My husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! Apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that I'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that I buy anything for myself. One of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.

I'm livid and I want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it. My husband is onboard for the most part, but his mother and siblings are telling us that this is just how he is and it's not that bad and we can just teach our kids otherwise.

AITA for wrapping a fake present for my kids?,"I have two sons from a previous marriage ages 8 and 9. I've had full custody for the last three years and it's just the step mom and me now. Their mother is no longer in the picture.

They were so excited about christmas last year. There were many presents for them under the tree from the grand parents and us, and they were constantly checking them out trying to guess what was in them. 

They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods. 

As the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was going like ""it's a..it's a"" and the final paper came off, ""brick"". I thought it was hilarious. The looks on their faces was priceless. Unfortunatly they were somewhat upset, tears were shed etc. So we let them open one more present to calm them down.

AITA for doing the same thing as my wife?,"My wife recently decided she doesn't want to give oral anymore. Her reason is that she doesn't like it and so doesn't think she should have to do it. Ofcourse she's right, no one can force her to give oral, and she's entirely within her right to refuse oral to me.

That said, I've always hated having Friday night dinners with my in-laws. My in-laws are nasty judgemental people and for the last 10+ years I've spent almost every Friday night - when I should be relaxing from a long week's work - with people that I honestly detest on some level. Why do I do this? Because it makes my wife happy and I want her to be happy.

So I told my wife that's fine - she doesn't have to, but that I'd also like to stop doing something which I hate - spending every friday with my in-laws.

WIBTA for suing my brother because he sold his house?,"Context: My brother and I are twins and had wealthy parents. We have some property that they bought for us for our 18th birthday.

Fast forward 14 years and we are both married. Our parents passed away and we finished dividing inheritance . My husband and I are fairly high earners in our own right, while my brother and his wife live off of his inheritance. Our parents wealth mainly came from stocks, bonds and their jobs so they didn't have much real estate.

Two years ago, my brother asked my husband and I for a loan so he could start his own business. I agreed to it and we sign a contract where he uses the real estate our father bought for him as collateral.  At this time, he had been living with his wife in a different city.

His business was lagging, but he still somehow managed to pay the bills. He was still making the monthly loan repayments to me, so I kept quiet.

Recently, I found out that he sold the property he gave me as collateral to one of our cousins. Neither of them said anything to me and he kept the money for himself and did not say a word about selling the property. Now I'm threatening legal action against him.

I'm getting calls from my SIL and my brothers MIL daily. At first they were begging me to forgive him and that he didn't know he wasn't allowed to sell it. Now they're calling me a heartless bitch for threatening to file a lawsuit and it wasn't his fault because I got an equal share as him from our inheritance even though I made more money.

Apparently his business was struggling so much he needed the money from the sale to keep it afloat.

My entire family is in an uproar, half siding with me and the other half with my brother.

EDIT: I do have a recorded lien, which was drafted by a lawyer. In the contract, the property was clearly stated to be collateral. Something obviously went wrong since he was able to sell the property, which I am now trying to figure out. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for saying no to major chores while wife enjoys holiday overseas?,"Sorry for the formatting, my first ever post and its from my cellphone.  

So a couple of months ago it was announced after 20 years with same company I would be made redundant. This was meant to be a good thing as i could spend the summer holidays with our daughter (5) who had started school for 2 weeks then hit the summer holidays.  I've never had a chance to have time off with her before. Instead my wife announces we are going to China (where she grew up and her parents still live).  She knows I do not enjoy visiting,  especially mid winter.  She talked me in to it by saying we would travel, which I am keen to do, great wall and terracotta warriors specifically mentioned.  Once the trip was booked she says.. ""oh we wont be able to see those things the weather makes travel hard, but we will do day trips out to other cities"".  Even that I could handle, but the day we arrive she days we wont be doing that either.  What happened was just as I feared (and as usual) I'm left to look after daughter in a small apartment in winter, while my wife relaxes in her old room, watching tv, making models and lego (her hobbies), being pampered by her parents and having lunches with her friends.  I had organised to return 5 days early to home, knowing I would want some time too.  It is now a few days until I leave and she has handede a list of chores to do like wash our house, move furniture, stuff she wants done, and will take most of my time. I said no, she will have had a months holiday doing everything she loves, while my few days are filled by tasks she wants...  I also pointed out she had denied me a month of summer holidays with our daughter (yes ive had lots of time in China with her, but stuck in a small apartment vs parks and playgrounds back home is not even close to the same).  I am now getting the cold shoulder and feel so isolated in a strange boring place.  Am I the asshole for wanting a few days to myself after the last couple of months I've had?

Update:
Hey all thanks for the comments so far.  Just to clarify, I agreed to the holiday believing we would travel out of town.  This is not usual behaviour from my wife, hence I am so caught out, and am unable to travel myself as I can speak very little Chinese. I also have a new job lined up in the new year.

Further update:
Hey all thanks for your comments and feedback.  To clarify, we are staying with my in-laws.  We visit China regularly, and they visit us each Chinese New year, and of course have taken the little one out the the malls and local area.  Major learning for me on description in my posts.  Also we live in the southern hemisphere, hence summer holidays atm.

That said I take on what people say about putting my foot down and could have owned the situation much better.
Have talked it out and agreed to tackle the chores together when everyone is back. Apparently the planned trips fell through and she just majorly downplayed it, falling back in to her comfort zone.  I'll take a more active role in planning our next trips here.

Another update:
Thank you again for the feedback, for those who think this is a bogus post, have added a pic link taken out the window this morning (not that it proves too much, but hey). We are in Shanghai, so not isolated but have done this area to death.  Making the most of what I have (I should have made that clearer) but it is limited, was just annoyed to then be asked to give up my own small amount of time after how things ended up here. As I say above, have now talked it through.

Ok Google drive was folly, open to an easier way to share in future....removed link, not that fussed if not believed.

Last post here.. again thank you it's been great reading the comments and I'm trying to take them all on.  Have a great Xmas all.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to feature my fiancé's former SO who passed away in our wedding?,"TW for loss and death. My fiance was engaged for about a month to his high school sweetheart when she passed away in a tragic, freak accident. For personal reasons, I don't want to get into how it happened, but it was no one's fault. This was maybe 6 years ago. Just for the purpose of the post I'll call her Mandy.

My fiance has been very open about this loss and how it has affected him throughout our relationship. I know he misses her and the memories he has with her and important and special. I don't want to take away anything or demean the relationship, and I've always been there for him on hard days and supported him when he needed it. We got engaged last year, the date is TBD still for obvious reasons. It was very emotional for both of us, and we've been really happy. But since planning the wedding, I've been feeling like I'm not only planning it for myself, but for Mandy as well.

It started as comments from his family. A lot of ""Oh Mandy would have loved this"" type things. I brushed it off at first and just thought it was a way of them processing grief. I have a great relationship with his family, but I know they loved Mandy too. When I went dress shopping, his mom and sister came. They kept talking about what dress Mandy would have worn, what they could see her in, etc. It might seem like nothing, but it really overtook the conversation, so much so that another bridesmaid told me later that she felt uncomfortable for me too. It turned from harmless comments into focusing what should be a special event for me into reminiscing over Mandy.

My latest project has been compiling old photos of me and my fiance for a slideshow at the reception (or rehearsal dinner we haven't decided). He told me theres something he's been wanting to ask me: he really wants to include some kind of ""in memory of Mandy"" into our wedding, and thinks the slideshow would be a perfect place. At this point, I was (and still kinda am) fed up with the Mandy comments taking over our wedding. I sternly told him that no I don't think that would be appropriate, as this is our wedding and should focus on us. We are having a table with pictures of loved ones who passed, and she will be featured there. He told me that he doesn't think that's enough to honor her memory. He wants to incorporate her in a bigger way, as she never got her dream wedding. He also thinks it would be a sweet surprise for Mandy's parents (who are invited since he is still really close to them).

I did lose my cool, I will admit. I told him honestly how I felt about the Mandy situation taking over our wedding, and how I'm uncomfortable with it. I also asked him if he could ask his family to limit the Mandy comments at our wedding, since now I'm afraid the whole wedding will be focused on her. I told him that I need time away to think and have been staying at my parent's house, but we've still been talking.

AITA? Am I overreacting?

Update: Thank you to everyone for the kind words, I've had a lot to digest over the past few days. I did try to post a separate update, but was told to just add it under my original. I'll try to put a condensed version under here.

The wedding is postponed indefinitely, but we are still together and working through things. He was defensive about the situation at first, but eventually came around. We both agreed that couples therapy is needed, and are in the process of starting that. 

As for his family, they are deeply sorry, especially (mostly) his mom. When I went to talk to her about it, she was really in tears. Mandy was like a daughter to her, so she said, and she just hasn't gotten over losing her yet. I talked to her about therapy (she told me she didn't go after Mandy died), and she agrees its something to look into, though not sure if anything concrete has come of it. I can't say that I feel 100% better about the situation, and I think that my relationship with his mom now has a bit of a strain on it, even if she did apologize. But I'm hoping to work through these things in therapy, and if I can't, or my fiance can't, then I'll have to do whats best for me and end the relationship. 

If anything else were to happen, I'll try to post an update. Again, thank you to everyone for the support, it means a lot.",Not the A-hole
AITA for changing my mind midway through buying a stranger coffee?,"I stopped by a local coffee place after work today. There was a woman behind me in line with a toddler, the kid was sweet and saying ""hello"" to everyone in line and genuinely brightened my day. 

While I was standing near the cash register waiting for my order, the woman stepped up and ordered a $4 coffee. I kindly offered to pay and she seemed so grateful and even thanked me twice. Right after, she turned back to the cashier and said, ""in that case, you can add two extra shots and a blueberry muffin.""

I was so taken aback, I immediately told the cashier that I changed my mind and she could pay for her own order. I walked over, picked up my drink and left without another word. 

AITA for reneging on my offer? 

Edit: I want to thank everyone so much for responding. The only thing I'd like to clarify is that I felt bad about it afterwards. She could have intended to pay for the add-ons, it could have been a joke, etc. I didn't communicate with her very well because I fell into a trap of assuming the worst. If she looked at me expectantly to pay, I would clearly not be an asshole. It was more my quick response of which I was unsure. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for putting up a fence when my neighbors went away for the weekend?,"I used to put up fences for a living. My wife and I (both women) recently bought my aunt and uncle's old home. The house has a large back garden with narrow paths along the sides of the house and this leads to a front garden that's about 1/3 of the size of the back, and is half grass and half paving stones. They have neighbors either side with the same set up.

The house is number 85. There is no fence between 85 and 83. 83 has 3 kids under 10 y/o. My back garden has a lot of space to run around, and as there is no fence and my cousins are similar ages to 83's kids, my aunt and uncle often let 83's kids come over and play with my cousins, and 83's kids have continued use the garden after my aunt and uncle left.

I have nothing against kids, nor does my wife, but we have plans for the back garden. These include putting up a shed, maybe a few flowers, and we're starting the adoption process soon so we want our kid to have space to play outside.

I went out and measured the property lines a couple weeks ago, and the husband of 83 came out and asked what I was doing. I explained about the fence, said I would pay for it, and put it up myself, told him about my former job doing exactly this, and asked when would be best for me to do it. He said not to do it at all. I asked why, he said they have a baby and I can't be bashing about with hammers and the like. I said I would try to keep it down but I would like to do this. He then asked why I needed to because things were fine as is. I said it's nothing personal, but I'm putting up a shed, and I just don't want his kids coming onto my property and getting hurt. He then said I can't put up the shed for the same reason as the fence, and I could see we weren't getting anywhere and went back inside.

Then Thursday night I'm coming home from work and I see the dad loading bags into their car. Saturday morning and the car is still gone, and has not been seen since Thursday. I figure they've gone away for the weekend and as the issue with me putting up the fence was the noise for the baby now would be the time to do it.

I bought the fence materials that day. I used wooden posts/panels and gravel to hold it in place. Whole thing was done by Sunday lunch. The fence posts are 1.8m and half of that is underground. These things aren't moving until the end of time. It's on my property and less than a meter tall so I didn't need permission from council or 83.

They got back Monday night and this morning I've woken up to knocking. The husband wants me to get rid of the fence. Says it's an eyesore and he's worried his kids will get injured on it. I tell him it's on my property and it's staying. He says he should have been consulted because it's surrounding his property and his wife hates it and thinks it's really ugly.

Legally I'm in the clear. Morally, am I the arsehole?

Info: it is a picket fence made of a pale wood. It looks clean and polished on both sides but my side is the one with visible building markers, eg there is a nail in my side of the fence. There is no such issue on his side and I am open to painting it.

Edit: In the nicest, most respectful way possible, I built fences as a routine part of my job nearly every day for the better part of 4 years, and have a qualification specifically in putting up various types of fences. Please stop asking me if the fence looks good or suggesting other ways I could have put the fence up. I know what I'm doing.",Not the A-hole
AITA for constantly bringing up the times my dad's new wife called me a slur?,"My dad remarried when I was in high school. His new wife, I'll call her Susan, always seemed to have a problem with me.

I overheard her fighting with my dad when I was a high schooler, referring to me as ""that fa**ot"" and stuff like that. This wasn't just once, it was a bunch of times.

I am a bisexual woman btw.

Anyway, I went to college and stayed well away from home and from Susan for most of two years. 

One time in freshman year my dad convinced me to come home for family Christmas. I told him I'd really like to hear Susan apologize for her language when I was home. He said she would. But after coming home, she didn't. She was honestly pretty cold to me.

At dinner my parents had placecards that Susan had made. Mine wasn't on there, and I felt like it might have been a deliberate thing? I was annoyed and said something that was honestly petty but felt good in the moment. I asked Susan ""Hey, where's my namecard? I don't even see one with ""Fa**ot"" on it, I know you thought that was my name for a while."" 

It caused a huge stir at dinner, like a lot of my cousins around my age and even some of the older relatives thought that word was messed up to say to anyone, let alone family.

Anyway I went back to campus early after that and didn't come back home for years. I'd stay on campus over the summer for summer classes and internships. 

But then, campus closed recently because of covid. I wanted to get a job so I could get an apartment. I actually got a job at a grocery store. And I was trying to find an apartment but it was hard in my budget. I was crashing at a friend's for the time being. 

Then I got a call from my dad saying he'd found out college was closed and he wanted me to come home. He promised stuff with Susan would be better, she'd changed. He wanted to make stuff right. He also really didn't want me working in a grocery store right now. 

So I agreed, I'd go home. 

And at first stuff was OK, but honestly Susan's been pretty obnoxious. She's kind of a control freak about the home, and it's stressful. She's also seemed to want to mother me in a weird way, chastising me for being out too late, for the study hours I choose etc...

I've started just referring to myself as Fa**ot since I can tell it makes her uncomfortable to be reminded of the way she's called me that. (Though apparently not uncomfortable enough to ever apologize?) 

And she finally blew up at me for being petty, for being profane, for bringing up something that happened years ago. 

I said that I didn't understand why she was bothered by that word so much, she chose to call me that first. I didn't do anything but use a name she'd given me, and never apologised for. And maybe things would be different if she apologized.

She still hasn't apologised...

"AITA for telling my boss his ""time theft"" concerns are not my problem?","The computers at my job are fairly crappy and require several minutes to boot. After turning them on I have to wait a couple of minutes for them to get to the password screen, then a few more minutes before they're all loaded up and ready to go. Typically I come in, turn them on, check my phone messages, hit the head (long commute to work) then get going. It's around 5 minutes max. 

&#x200B;

So this morning he calls a meeting and announces that going forward he wants everyone there 10 minutes before their required start time in order to boot their machines and starts citing how much this so-called ""time theft"" is costing him and etc. I replied that if he wants me to come in at 8:50 instead of 9 that's fine, but the ten minutes has to come off the end of the day unless he's going to pay the 50 minutes of OT a week. I also pointed out that when he opens the building at 8am he could spend two minutes turning on everyone's (three people) computers, which would cut the wait time in half at least. Then I said that my time is as valuable to me as his is to him and even though it's ""just ten minutes"" they're MY ten minutes, not his and I'm not interested in donating my time for nothing.

AITA for not telling my wife I had a vasectomy?,"I’ve been married to my wife for two years now and she’s always wanted to have a child  with me. She mentions it often. I’ve even been “trying” to have one with her. The problem is that I’ve had a vasectomy and she doesn’t know.

My ex wife came over and dropped off our 3 kids 9, 5 and 4. And she’s pregnant by her now husband. Well her and my wife were talking about her new baby and if she knew the gender. Now my ex knows that I’ve been fixed as I did so after our youngest was born. 

Well my wife says “I can’t wait to be pregnant, we’ve been trying to have a baby with no luck but it will happen when God allows it” my ex just smiled and she then looked at me and I knew what she was thinking with the look she gave me. 

Later she texted me and told me I needed to tell my wife the truth and that she had baby fever and it was cruel to give her false hopes and pretty much called me a A$$hole. So AITA? I know it’s a little dishonest but it would break my wife’s heart to know the truth.",Asshole
WIBTA for telling a 'homophobe' that I've seen his Grindr account?,"For the sake of convenience, I'll call homophobe 'J'.

J and I used to be friends in school, until I came out as gay and he began to distance himself from me and spread rumors. He then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.

Years pass, and I'm scrolling through Grindr when I spot a faceless torso picture, unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. His profile states that is hookup only, with no face pictures given.

I think to myself ""Oh, he came out, good for him."" Then I look at his FaceBook. He's still spouting homophobia, sharing LGBT stories with his own opinions etc, and harrassing LGBT people that he comes across online.

So, WIBTA to tell him if I found his profile and recognized him, many of the people he's insulted could easily find him as well?

AITA for walking out of the hospital after hearing my wife’s diagnosis?,"I (33) get a call from the ER on Friday saying that my wife (32) drove herself there because of searing pelvic pain. 

I’m on a business trip until Saturday but I drive back in time to be there Saturday morning before she woke up. 

A while after she wakes up, the doctor comes in. My wife says to stay with her so I say ok. He takes a deep breath and said that from the transvaginal ultrasound and CT scan results, she has ovarian cancer.

My wife starts sobbing but at first I stay still because I don’t even know what to make of it. 

My wife asks what that means for her and he says that she’ll likely at least need a full hysterectomy, and they’d have to remove the Fallopian tubes as well as the ovaries. 

That news jolted me from my chair. Because the doctor was effectively telling me that she wouldn’t be able to have kids after this, and after years of work, I thought we’d finally have a family.

I’m overwhelmed with emotions of anger, not just anger at the disease, but pent up anger form the fact that I had begged her to have kids since we were 26, but she refused for her career.

And now instead of becoming a real family, I didn’t even know if she would remain the woman I married, whether the last picture of us together would be last time I’d remember her looking beautiful, young, and carefree. Because the wife I as in front of me was already a different person. 

My wife started to grab my hand and say “ We’ll fight this and we’ll adopt.” 

But I shook my head and turned to walk out the door. I still had my suitcase in the car so I drove to a hotel because I didn’t know if my wife was going to end up being discharged or what. 

At the hotel I was at least able to get out of reactive mode, but I was still so disappointed  that our dream of a family was over. 

I finally was able to get a grasp on all my emotions and feel more like my normal self in that I knew exactly what I felt about every aspect and how I would react to it from here on out. 

I get a call from my MIL saying that if I was at a hotel or “ wherever else” I should just stay there. 

AITA for walking out? I admit it was done on impulse but this diagnosis just sliced my life and my wife’s life wide open. 

I wasn’t going to expel the cancer if I stayed that night but I did at least make myself aware of my situation. And I feel I have a right to be angry that my hope of biological kids, the only kind I ever wanted, is rapidly fading away.",Asshole
"AITA for not telling my sister about my nephew's new ""boyfriend""?","Last year I took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. I'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but I felt it was important. I should also note that I left the church of latter day saints (Mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of Utah. It's part of the reason I am divorced. 

Anyway, last night I took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. I put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. In my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. The ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""Nothing better than hanging out with the people I love."" I thought it was innocent enough. He never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

My sister is furious. She said that she should have been notified that he was dating. When I told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. Here's the thing though. There is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. Now that she knows he's gay I don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

I also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. I have legal guardianship over my nephew. He's living in my home. She kicked him out. She started crying after I said this and told my family so I've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person I am for saying that to my sister. I don't see it but maybe I'm wrong. Should I have told her even though they aren't serious? Was it a low blow to say the things I said to her? Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I feel like an asshole now for asking this question. It probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. Walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing I ever had to do and I think I still carry a lot of guilt from that. My kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. To have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. I don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

Edit2: I completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. I want to be super clear that wasn't what I intended to do. When you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. I let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. Every decision I make is harder for me than it is for most people.

AITA for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?,"Every summer my community has a cookoff competition. Usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. It's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. This year it was pasta sauce. I've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and I moved here but this is the first time I entered as a competitor. It was earlier today.

One of the other competitors, I know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with Asperger's Syndrome and autism. I don't know much about this condition evidently. I'll call her Jessica. I guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. We've never had this before as far as I know.

To make the story short, I won the competition. And $1,500. There's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. My wife and I were in shock because I like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? We were tickled pink. 

We celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. You might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to Jessica as a ""gesture of good will"". They said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. We obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. So they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with Jessica. Likewise we said no.

I guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. Apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. After a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.

AITA for telling my husband I regret having our children and telling my daughter I never wanted her?,"I (f24) have 4 children. I had my first when I was 19. My children are 5F, 3F, 2F and 1M. All of our children have been planned, but it’s always been my husband pushing to have another. If he’d have let me I would’ve stopped after our oldest. I never really wanted to be a mom, and don’t feel as though I connect with them very well. 

A few nights ago I was putting my eldest daughter to sleep when she started asking me loads of questions. She’s a really curious little girl. I had a traumatic birth with her and post natal depression so always struggled with bonding, and still do struggle connecting with her. She told me she wants lots of babies when she’s older and then asked me how many I wanted when I was her age. I told her I didn’t want any and that I didn’t even want any when I had her. I know she’s only 5 but she massively misinterpreted it and got upset. I comforted her and put her back to sleep. 

In the morning she must’ve told her father what had happened when he was making her breakfast as I woke up to my husband absolutely furious with me for traumatising our daughter and damaging her self esteem. I told him she’d be fine but he kept shouting at me telling me I was an awful mother. I replied that it’s hard being a good mother to kids you regret having. He asked if I was being serious and I said that I was being impulsive when I said that but that I didn’t want them and he knew that.

"AITA for asking a ""pregnant"" woman to get out of our forum for women who can't have children","Throwaway.

I'm trying to keep this short: I'm (f/41) the mod of a forum for women who can't have children and have been so for the past 7 years.

On this forum there's a sub-group of around 20 women (all mid 30s to mid 50s) who have been on there for over 10+ years and we are very close. I consider all of them close personal friends, we've gone through very horrible times together, from first realizing we won't be able to have children, to accepting this, to dealing with friends/family etc. Three years ago one of our members died from MS and we've been even closer ever since.

So here's the deal: at the beginning of March one of our members, let's call her Mary (47) suddenly announced that she and her husband found a surrogate and that they were having a baby. Now mind you Mary has been one of the longest members of the forum and has told us in detail why a surrogate wouldn't work etc. so we were all beyond baffled. But of course, we were primarily very happy for her.

The problem new consists of the fact that I've been approached by several members telling me they are uncomfortable with Mary still being in the group because even though she tries not to, she constantly brings up the fact that she is about to be a mother while all of us are suffering from the fact that we never will be. Of course, this is the biggest event in Mary's life and I understand why she can't stop talking about it, it's completely understandable.

We are all friends and the group has evolved over the years but its main reason for existing is still the fact that none of us can have children and that is its main purpose, that is the main thing we talk about.

I've asked Mary to please not talk about it so much and while she seemed hurt, she promised she would tone it down. Well ... she hasn't. In the last week she's talked about the pregnancy, the surrogate, all the items they've bought, how excited her family is, how her mother cried when she told her etc.

All of it makes us incredibly upset. Yesterday I told her that either she stopped talking about it or I would have to ban her from the group and she got very angry and made a huge post in our group, accusing us all of not being happy for her, not being able to jump over own shadows etc.

I think she wants to keep us as friends but not have to deal with the reason why we became friends in the first place. I personally think she doesn't really have a place in our group anymore. The group is very divided over this and I've gotten more angry calls in the last 24 hours than I ever have in my entire life before that. However, there are also a whole group of women agreeing with me.

I'm trying to keep the peace but at this point it doesn't seem possible.

So, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: For anyone that cares - I've not really been a part of the group anymore for the past several weeks because the stress has been too much and I have to deal with more important things. I made another woman in our group the new mod but from what she's told me, nothing much has changed in the group apart from the fact that Mary has toned down her baby-talk a lot. Apparently other women talked to her as well and she realized that what she did was really unfair to the rest of us. Personally I've not talked to Mary since the whole deal but I suspect we'll talk again sooner rather than later since I don't have much time left on this earth.",Not the A-hole
AITA for contesting a will and likely getting all of the inheritance instead of my dad's girlfriend?,"My dad ran off with my mom's friend when I was 12. My mom and my dad never legally divorced.

My mom passed away a few years ago and my dad passed away late last year.

AITA for contesting the will even though he left everything he owned to his girlfriend? They share two young kids I don't have a relationship with.

Where I live, since my parents weren't divorced, I'm the sole legal ""heir"" to my parents' estates.

I already got a good chunk from my mom and I'm also a medical professional so it's not like I'm hurting for money. My wife also works at a good job.

But the way I see it, it's not my fault my dad never made things official with his girlfriend and she can figure out her own finances.

AITA for letting my friend “publicly humiliate” my BIL in front of dozens? Husband thinks I should take some responsibility.,"Obligatory throwaway and also this happened about a year ago. It’s resurfacing again because BIL has made it a point to ignore me since and my husband wants me to apologize once and for all. 

So some background: my BIL, 43, sees himself as an expert in all things and grew up with the kind of family that always praised him for being “brilliant” (he’s really not). 

Personally I’ve always disliked him because he’s arrogant and always calls me “over emotional” whenever I disagree with him on anything. Instead of owning up to his mistakes when he’s caught, he’ll also pretend like he never said it or you just misunderstood him or you’re too “irrational” for him to continue the convo. 

On our anniversary dinner last year, BIL was sat close to me and further down the table was one of my good friends who happened to be in town. 

Well he was spouting some major BS about stock markets this time. He had just gotten really into investing and none of us really knew what he was talking about. I couldn’t pinpoint why it was wrong but it all sounded pretty made up to me.

This is the part where I could’ve been TA. So my friend is actually a fairly famous financial strategist. She has been watching stock markets for over 2 decades. She’s constantly on TV and her face has been on the cover of industry magazines.

Anyways, I asked BIL to repeat what he said to my friend (she was too far away to hear organically). I definitely did channel that initial conversation and I did NOT introduce her as an expert. I won’t drone on but you can imagine what happened. My friend refuted a few of his points fairly nicely, corrected some of his glaring misconceptions, he then blew up, told her to stop misquoting him and read more, and she finally dropped the bomb of what she does for a living. He mumbled about everyone “overreacting” over things he supposedly never said (despite everyone hearing him say those things minutes earlier) then stayed quiet.

It was glorious to see but it was also pretty apparent BIL was beyond humiliated because he made a lame excuse about how his stomach hurts and left dinner not 15 min later.

It’s been a long time now but BIL avoids me like the plague and my husband wants us to resolve things. He thinks I should take the initiative to apologize because I was the one that started it by redirecting the convo to someone I knew would be an expert over BIL. AITA for what I did? I didn’t need to make that convo happen, but it just seemed so perfect at the time I couldn’t resist. But I admit had I not done it none of this would be happening and it does feel petty looking back. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for insulting a customer at my dad’s restaurant for making unsolicited suggestions about my hair?,"I (F 22) work part time at my father’s restaurant/deli as a cashier while I’m in school. I’m mixed, so my natural hair is very thick and curly textured and since I stopped keeping it in a protective style, I like to where it out in a semi Afro. One day, a frequent customer (an old man, probably around 70) says, “you are such a pretty girl, you shouldn’t wear your hair like that. You’d look much better if you went to a salon and gotten it straightened out”. 
I said back to him “maybe you should have some hair before you comment about mine”. He’s old, so he’s a bit bald. He called me rude and nasty, then flagged down my dad about it. I got in trouble but I refused to apologize. My dad has also commented on my hair before. I told the customer, “I’m not trying to make it about race but my dad is an older white guy as well, and I’m not white. My hair will never be straight unless I flat iron it”. But I’m not apologizing and I don’t feel bad about saying what I said.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for not helping to pay for my sister's college, even though I could easily afford to?","I'm 29, my sister is 27.

We're polar opposites. I've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. My sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

Recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

On the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

I shut down the idea immediately. In my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. My GF and I plan on getting married soon and I don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

As you can imagine I'm now seen as the greedy brother who won't help out family... Even though my sister has never done anything to help me.

"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend over ""consent required""?","Before any of you start freaking out at me, I want to say that I fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and I would never in my life think about treating another person that way. Now that thats out of the way, the AITA moment.  

I've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\~ months.  In this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  We've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  Our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  This goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  Things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   This has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  We've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.

Now, on this last friday, I went over to her apartment.  We put on some stupid netflix documentary that I can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  I got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  I do the business and make her feel good.  After this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  I try to talk to her because I can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  I tell her that I know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then I should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.

""I just feel like you kind of use me.  You never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.""

Now, of course I understand the sentiment.  I'm not always the most romantic of person, I try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but I can see where shes coming from.  Still, I was \[visibly confused\] at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that I never listen to her.

I point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  She gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  I tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  

At this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that I'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless I ask first and she gives me permission.

I say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like I'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because I want to touch the woman I've been dating for 8 months.

""Well maybe you are!"" she says angrily.  At this point, I'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  I just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  She throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time I just leave and go home.

Not five minutes after I walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, I think it over for a minute and decide that I'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.

&#x200B;

I woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because I ""broke up with the perfect woman because I wasn't allowed to grope her whenever I want.""

So, Am I the asshole here?  I feel like I'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that I've missed?  Am I the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  

&#x200B;

And before you start yelling at me (even though I'm sure half of you have already started typing) I respect a persons right to say no.  If I touch my girlfriend, or any girl I'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, I'll stop, no question.  I just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.  ",Not the A-hole
"AITA For not telling my daughter to apologise to a boy she swore at, at school?","My daughter has been subtly bullied by a boy at school since the start of the year.

WIBTA if I take over planning my funeral from my very religious parents?,"TLDR at the bottom;

Hello, all! Well, if it isn't obvious already from the title, I am dying. I don't feel the details are super relevant to the issue at hand, but for those who are curious about my ultimate demise, I have cystic fibrosis and after two rejected lung transplants, I've been told there isn't anything else they can do except keep me comfortable in my last few weeks. I've begun my preparations for my funeral and such and while I was thinking it would be a breath of fresh air in this whirlwind of death, I could not have been more wrong.

Now, on to the title! My parents are both STRICT Southern Baptists and want a very traditional funeral. This includes; hymns to be sung during the memorial, a casket and graveside service, a viewing, countless prayers during the memorial, scripture to be read, etc. My issue with this is...well, everything. I am the complete opposite of my parents; not religious, curse like a sailor, drink like the Irish, you name it. Everything they are wanting and attempting to plan is not me as a person. I've somehow made it to 25 and managed to meet the man of dreams and marry him last year and he is torn. He wants me to have it exactly as I want, he just doesn't want to have to deal with my parents after the fact while actively grieving. I have two siblings, one of which is a clone of my parents and one that is a mixture of my parents and myself. 

I want my service to be one full of laughter, funny stories and pictures, upbeat music, cats (my husband and I are avid cat lovers), I want confetti and shit! But, more importantly, I want to be cremated and put in a fucking cat-shaped urn. I told my husband I wanted my ashes to be handed out like party favors (so my family and friends can take me with them because I love to travel) and he looked horrified. 

My parents are absolutely NOT on board and are essentially planning everything how they want. Attempting to take me ""shopping"" for a casket, flowers, picking out hymns and verses, the whole deal. I'm obviously not very pleased. 

So, I guess my question would be, WIBTA if I took control of my own funeral and wrote a will to be followed exactly how I want it? I understand my parents are grieving and I've tried to compromise with a mixture of both my views and theirs, but, they aren't having it. I never thought dying would be so fucking stressful and I just want to enjoy what time I have left, without leaving a bomb of emotion and disappointment behind. Please, help.

TLDR: I am dying and my parents want to plan a funeral that ""isn't me"" as a person.

EDIT: I should clarify the ""ashes as party favors"" thing. I wanted my closest friends and family to go home with a vial or something of the sort of my ashes that way they could do with them as they please! Not everyone will get a piece of me, as strange as that sounds!

2nd EDIT: HOLY SHIT. I was not expecting this! THANK YOU. Seriously. I have read every comment and I wish I could reply to every single one, that is the goal! So, please, be patient with me. Thank you to everyone for the kind words and messages, it's been so overwhelming and if I were a cat, I would be making biscuits and purring until I keeled over. I am writing down everything that I want and will be approaching my parents in order to find a compromise. Yes, funerals are for the living and being able to remember that person for who they WERE. I am not all of the things my parents wanted me to be and I want them to understand this as they deal with my passing. I am willing to compromise, so, wish me luck! I will attempt to keep up with everything and as lame as this sounds, I'm off living my best life and trying to do something different everyday, so, I won't always have my phone.

AITA for telling my husband I won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again?,"I have two children from a previous relationship. Danielle (11) and Elliot (7). My husband John loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, Alicia, from a previous relationship. We've been married four years, but I've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

Over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to Spain for three weeks. John was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. However, when he told Alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which I did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

It all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out Alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, I couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. She then phoned up her mum crying saying I was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' She also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


We had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. She was cuddling with one of them, and when Elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. As her guardian on the trip I was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. She threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if I won't let her have fun. 

Finally, Alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise Danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. I stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

When we got back I told John how difficult Alicia had been throughout the trip and said that I wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. He insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but I insisted on speaking to Alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. She defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. I was shocked, but after John and Leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if I get to know her and things like that. 

I've not said that I'll never be in the same room as her again, I've just said that I won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but John says that I'm overreacting, and that I should give her another chance, which I have no intention of doing.

UPDATE: Thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. While I still stand by my decision and won't take Alicia on holiday unless John is there with me, a lot of people said that I haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. Even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), I think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. It is of course Leanne's decision but it isn't something I'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. As some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why I told John that I will make the effort to get to know Alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as I can.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for reporting my neighbours?,"A few years ago my partner (27M) and I (27F) bought our first home. I had some savings & a sum of money that had come through from a medical negligence case, & my partner had some inheritance money. 

We met our neighbours(68M, 65F) the day we started moving furniture in. The woman demanded to know our landlords name so she could ""keep in contact with him"" & seemed genuinely offended when we told her we owned the house. She made a shitty comment about how she had to work all her life to buy her house, & we were ""too young"" to deserve a home

I'm waiting on an organ transplant, so work from home in the meantime. One morning I came home from a quick walk around the block with my dog & noticed their son's car parked across my driveway and blocking mine in. I knocked on the door and politely explained that I need to be able to leave at all times in case of a medical emergency, especially if I'm called in for a transplant. The woman snapped at me that she doesn't like people parking next to her because it makes her drive ""look messy"". Her son did move the car, but called me selfish & a snowflake as he did so. 

Once she hammered on my door and told me to ""shut (my) dog up because he's been barking all day"" even though he was at the vet and had been for a few days. About a month after that, I noticed my dog eating something in my garden. I went over to investigate, & saw he had a chocolate bar in his mouth & had eaten most of it. I found a few more empty wrappers scattered along the fence between my yard & the neighbours', immediately called the vet. I'm pretty sure it was my neighbour, but I don't have solid proof so I can't say anything.

More than once I've caught her trying to steal our post from the postman. I just don't get *why*.  A lot of it is just stuff I need for work (printer paper, sticky notes, etc) with no real monetary value, or medical stuff and non-prescription supplements that are pretty specific to my illness and no use to anyone else. There's literally nothing to be gained from taking it.

Her husband is racist and homophobic, and uses the P-word, N-word,& F-word all the time. He also really hates children. Last Halloween he threw a bucket of water over a group of trick-or-treaters. when the parents came over to complain they pretended they weren't home. 

We've been thinking about extending our kitchen just a little to make it a bit more accessible for me. Somehow in the process, we found our the neighbours' own extention was done illegally. They'd been denied planning permission, but they built it anyway. During the process, they'd also caused some aesthetic damage to our property. A really petty part of me wants to report them, because they've been needlessly nasty for *years*. They would be forced to have it taken down AND pay for the repairs to our house.

AITA for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?,"Back in 2009 when the economy tanked I lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. Basically everything. At first I didn’t want anyone to know what had happened so I stayed at a friends house for a week while I looked for a new job. But his landlord told me guests couldn’t stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. So I asked my mother if I could stay with her while I looked for a job. I told her I’d be on the street homeless if she didn’t help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. Fast forward 2 months, I’ve been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. Even something like Safeway or McDonald’s. My dad finds out that I’m homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in NJ and I accept. Within a week I have a job and in 3 months I’m in my own place again. It’s been 10 years since then and I haven’t spoken to my mother because of what I perceive to be a betrayal. She attempts to contact me frequently and I ignore it.

AITA for leaving an 18 cent tip and getting the waitress fired?,"I was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. I pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress I didn't need change. Goes without saying, but I was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. I used to work as a server. I always tip generously. 

The waitress misunderstood my intentions and said ""Really?"" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. Before I could say anything, she said something like ""Woooow- thanks for the generous tip"", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. All the diners around me were staring daggers at me. It was humiliating. 

I flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. He knows me and knows I'd never stiff servers. 

He offered to comp the meal, but I said it wasn't necessary. I just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. The manager insisted that I was owed an apology. Made sense to me at the time. She apologizes, gets her tip, I leave, everyone is happy. 

When the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. As soon as the manager saw this, he put on his ""you're about to get fired"" face. All the tears and pleading made no difference. It was ugly. People were filming with their cell phones. 

As she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think I'm the second coming of Satan). The manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. 

When we got home, the wife claimed I was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding.

WIBTA if i told my roommate that he absolutely should not be using Magnum condoms?,"Story time. About 3 weeks ago, my roommate had sex with a girl, and the aftermath was a nightmare. He got a text from her two(!!) full days afterwards saying she had just “peed out a condom”, and that it was super “sus” that he didn’t tell her that it came off during sex. My roommate claims that he was unaware that it came off, blaming it on his tipsy state at the time the sex occurred. 

My roommate is not lying. I’ve known him for many moons and truly believe the condom fell off unintentionally and that he was truly unaware. But that’s not even the point. 

When he told me what happened, I had no idea what kind of condoms he used. I don’t give a shit and it’s none of my business. Until yesterday.

Yesterday we went to the corner store together and he bought some condoms... Magnum condoms. 

Now, this guy is 5’8 and I’ve seen him in his undies one hundred times. He ain’t packin that kind of heat. 

I had an epiphany when he showed me the Magnums. I realized that the condom fell off because the fucking thing is way too big for him to be wearing. 

I asked him if that’s what he always uses, and he said yes and boasted a little bit. The boasting is why i’m typing this out.

Should I tell this insecure motherfucker that his cock is simply not big enough to warrant him using Magnum condoms? I looked it up, Magnums are meant for penises that are at least 8” x 2”. There is zero chance this guy is packing like that, and the condom falling off inside that girls vagina is solid  proof, and I don’t know how he didn’t realize it then.

Here’s the thing: he’s the kind of dude you hear about that loves to relish in his high school days as a Super Athlete™️. He’s pretty insecure and is *constantly* trying to get laid. I feel like telling him that his cock isn’t as big as he thinks it is would crush him, and maybe even make him resent me.

But like, that shit is dangerous. The dummy shoved a magnum condom so far up a girls vagina that she didn’t pee it out until 48 hours later.

Okay now to the part where I might be TA. We had just had lunch and were comming back from the cafeteria and I met my coworker who was standing there with some other people. She waved me over and they were all snickering. I asked what was up and they began telling me things about my dad that made my blood boil. One of the girls (an intern who happens to be one of the students of my father) was ranting about how my father was an asshole who ignored her this morning ans basically accused him of being a sexist. Before I could interfere and lift the misunderstanding they began making jokes about him. About the way he talks, walks everything. They started ripping into his appereance and saying things like ""I am so sorry for his wife. His dick must bet tiny"". I was boiling at that point. So I just looked at them and told them (paraphrasing) "" please don't talk about my father that way. He didn't ignore you.... He is deaf in one ear and sometimes doesn't hear people. I hope you don't talk about other people this way. Grow up we are not in middle school anymore""

I did my best to not scream or anything but my voice was more stern than in other occasions. They stood frozen for a couple of seconds and instead of saying sorry they started to begg that I don't report them. This made me even more mad because they weren't sorry for what they did... They were just sorry they got caught.

Before that I wasn't really thinking to report them. I talked to my mother and she said to report their asses but my husband is saying that he is sure my father wouldn't want that and that he doesn't care what people think about him.

Would I be ta if I report them?


Edit : This weren't all student guys! We work in an office and the intern was the only student there. The rest of us have allready graduated and we work full time jobs",Not the A-hole
AITA For telling my adopted sister to go back to her true family?,"Throwaway because my parents use reddit and know my reddit account.

I know how the title sounds, but if you are not willing to read the full post before commenting then don’t comment at all. Your perspective about this situation might change.

Being the only child in the family was awesome. I got to have my own room, friends, ipad, etc… which am now obligated to share with my so called sister (yes, even friends). They adopted her 1 year ago for a reason I till now fail to understand but I strongly believe it’s because I was not good enough for them. I’m really hurt because they NEVER EVER asked me if I want another sibling. I just had to accept the fact that I suddenly have a younger sister and should now share everything I have with her and treat her as part of the family. How am I supposed to do that? I can’t just start feeling close to her. And the fact that I am forced to involve her in all my plans infuriates me and makes me hate her even more.

Today my friends and I decided to challenge ourselves to stay awake all day by doing many different sort of things that will keep us from getting bored. Obviously since we share the same room my sister heard this and told me she would like to join the activity. I was honestly hoping I could finally do something without her but of course she had to ruin it. I told her no and she said she is going to tell my parents about it. I then got mad and told her to get the fuck out of my house and go back to her biological family (excuse my language), her voice then changed and she told me she doesn’t know where they are but I told her to shut the fuck up (Again excuse my language) and not get emotional with me because I really had it with her. She left the room and I started crying because of how stressed she makes me but realized I should whip my tears fast because my parents can’t see me like this. Otherwise, they will believe my adopted sisters words and I’ll get punished for it. She obviously told them but I denied what I said. I normally don’t lie so they believed my words and are now talking to her, obviously without being harsh and will still not punish her because god forbid they treat my adopted sister wrongly.

AITA for the way I reacted?

Also, I’m not sure if I get to have this option, but I would like for auto mod not to copy my post in case I edit or delete. Thank you.

FINAL edit before leaving

Wow. I am back after 7 hours and this happened. Ok guys I got it, I am the asshole. No need for more YTA comments or face palm/poop awards to let me know that what I did was wrong. Also regarding the auto mod, the mods responded and told me they will not remove it so calm down.  I won’t delete the post so you no longer need to upvote automod. This is embarrassing.

AITA for asking my sister to be discreet about her polyamorous (Male-Female-Female) relationship in front of the kids?,"I guess it should be are “we” the assholes, but idk if that’s an accepted acronym here. 

Apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I’ll try to lay it out as best I can. 

My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

It will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids’ ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

We initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they’ve been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

My sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation. 

Are we wrong?",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting my daughter lip injections?,"I would like others to give me their opinion on this situation. A lot of people are angry with me but I think at the end of the day I did this to help my daughter. 

My daughter is seventeen years old. She turned seventeen in February. Since she was around ten, she has been complaining about her lips. She inherited her fathers thin lips. They are a great shape, but they are thin. She has been bullied for it for ages. She has come crying to me about it several times. I thought she would get over it as she got older, but she never has. 

My daughter lives with her father and step mother full time because I travel for work. But when I am in town, she tends to stay with me for weeks at a time. We are very close. Two weeks ago she confided in me that she had been saving money for lip injections for two years now. She had a lot of money saved up.

We had a heart to heart about it and I decided to go ahead and pay for her to get them from a good doctor. I signed the consent forms and we did it. She is very happy with them, she loves them. They have really balanced out her face. 

When it was time for me to leave for work again, I took her back to her father’s. He flipped it. He started yelling at both of us and claiming that we destroyed her face. I apologized to him for not clearing it with him, but it was because I knew that he would say no. This was something she has really wanted for a long time. He argues that she is a child and doesn’t know what she wants.

Of course he has spread the news of the lip injections to several family members. They think that it is shameful that I would take my daughter to get plastic surgery and are urging him to limit my visitation (probably not going to happen). I think that they just do not empathize with my daughter and are excited to shame me for letting her get the most minor plastic surgery. She would have gotten it herself anyway, I just wanted to make sure it was done correctly. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for blowing up at my SO for his response to birth control?,"No throwaway because I actually don't care if he sees this. 

Basically, my SO said he wasn't willing to get a vasectomy just in case we break up and he wants to have kids with another woman.

I've been solely responsible for contraception for the entire length of our relationship (the pill) and I don't want to take hormonal BC anymore because it murders my sex drive. Yes I've tried other things. I can't use condoms because they hurt. All brands. 

I am scheduled to have a sterilisation so it's moot point but it's something I'm doing for the both of us, not just me. 

He tells me he doesn't want or can't handle any more kids. 

So why does he need to hang onto his precious fertility? It was just discourse, I don't expect him to do it but that answer has actually crushed me. It shows a lack of faith in our relationship and that he has an eye out for the long game. 

Am I the asshole for telling him he's an utter knob for that response?

Edit: guys, I've never asked him to do this. He volunteered this information during a conversation about my impending sterilisation. I have NOT asked him to snip his junk.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not including my recently divorced exwife on a family trip?,"10 months ago my wife of 15 years explained to me she had interest in a coworker so I left it up to her to decide whether to open up our marriage. I figured it was just an exploratory phase. Something she would have a change of heart about. After 5 months of being miserable with her going off with him nearly every weekend I expressed to her I wanted to look for someone else. She replied that it would only push her to the other man. Nonetheless I started seeing someone and after the first day of me seeing someone else, my wife wanted a divorce.

We have officially been divorced for a week. We have 3 kids together. We are also living together for the time being while she and her boyfriend are closing on a house together. 

Recently our family friend's wife contacted me and invited me and the kids to join her family on a trip. I planned on taking my girlfriend along with us. I explained to the family friend that if my family were to go on the trip my kid's mother would not be going.They acknowledged and figured that was going to happen.

Realistically there is no room for 2 extra people. Personally I have no interest in going on a trip with her and the man she left me for. She said she was hurt that my girlfriend is going in her place and that she was ousted so soon. She suggested that it could just be me, her and the kids as per usual before our divorce. While our papers were signed a week ago, I am ready to settle into my new normal.

AITA for not including her?

EDIT: My oldest is 14 and has known about basically everything from the beginning.  My younger 2 are 9 and 10. Both had suspicion about their mother's relationship with the bf before finding out the gory details. Mine was a tidy secret until that point. Once the younger 2 learned the truth they made the decision as to when they met my gf. This has been 2 months today. The conflict for me falls to the other family having been ""our"" friends for 14 years. Also the desire for things to remain healthy as possible between my ex and myself for the sake of the kids.  My ex hopes to still do things like this together as ""family "" and in the future maybe we can but right now I don't think I could stomach it. I explained this to my ex and she seems to be heartbroken at the notion. She is crying and I just feel irritated.  Kinda makes me feel like an asshole.  This situation is centered around myself and my ex, the kids are actually doing pretty well.

EDIT 2: I spent 5 months doing everything I could think of to save us. She spent 5 months leaving me at home with the kids. Lie after lie and zero shits given about my feelings.  The exact moment I said F it was when she didn't want me to attend her office Christmas party as I have every year for over a decade.  Her reasoning was she didn't want her coworkers to think she was a whore. Sounds to me like she was pushing a narrative that I was no longer in the picture.  That was the moment I realized where I stood and that being faithful to her was a waste. My girlfriend walked into my life 3 days later. The hypocrisy and insanity that followed were truly unbelievable.  After her initial immediate demands for divorce  she decided that we should ""start"" working on our marriage.  Step 1 was ditch my girlfriend.  Mind you I had known her for a week and had no real ties to her. 
Nothing to say about how she would end her 5 month relationship with a man she works 40hrs a week with and that is centric to her friend group.  I may or may not be an asshole for excluding her from this trip but I'm not asking about the demise of the marriage.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my step dad to replace my laptop with a new £2000 one?,"Throwaway because I have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

I (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, I splurged on a £2000 ($2600) HP Spectre with the highest specs. I treasured the laptop, it was my baby. I used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

Now, my step dad is a horrible person. He's always complaining about what I spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so I wouldn't be able to spend so much money. He's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that I paid a lot for.

I should also mention that I don't live with him, so what I spend my money on makes no difference to him.

Anyway, I've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. I don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. I could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. When my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear I deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. He's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

My mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. I'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

However, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over £500. I understand that £2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and I spent so long saving. I've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less I will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. My whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

So, I know I'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. But am I for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just want to say thank you guys so much for all the well wishes and advice. Let me clear a few things up as well:

\- unfortunately, the laptop is snapped in half by my whale of a step parent, so there's no chance of repairs

\- also, I know I'm not TA for asking for the replacement, I just know how much my family will struggle to pay me back this amount and my main concern is whether I'm wrong to do that to the rest of them :(",Not the A-hole
"AITA for throwing away my dishes rather than wash them, even if my roommate can't afford to replace them?","I'm 28F, my roommate is 29F and is a single mother to an 8 month old.

We both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. I had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. It's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

Now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. I don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. She mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. It begins to smell immediately and after an hour? I've thrown up before from the smell. But whatever, kids gotta eat.

My problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. She'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when I'm at work. After 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. I always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. Try as I might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. I even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

After about a month of this, I've begun just throwing them out. Instead of cleaning them, I throw my dishes away. We have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate. She's started using my cups to make it and I'll be throwing those away, too. It is nothing to me to replace these things and when I do, I'll be keeping them hidden.

AITA for getting a single mother fired even though she was nice to me?,"For context, I am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since I was 13 (now 29).

Anyway, I’m not really friends with her, but she’s always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. We talk occasionally. Yesterday she asked if I wanted to add her on social media and I figured why not, so I said yes.

Later in my workout I started looking through her posts out of boredom when I saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. The picture was clearly taken at the gym.

This really angered me because they’re trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it’s not to their face. I scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. She discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they’re working out.

Really really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. Without thinking I just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. Ashley was fried immediately.

AITA for renaming my sons 2 guinea pigs to names that I prefer over names he chose for them?,"EDIT going to stop responding because alot of the yta responses are getting exhausting to read, but there has been allot of good advice and kind replies here, thank you. 

Pig tax http://imgur.com/gallery/JXqtDgb



My son is 10, 1 year ago he asked for a pet Guinea pig.
We have a large garden so I agreed but only with some terms. 

I would cover the upkeep of food, bedding and pig treats and toys.


He would have to save up half the money for a large hutch and I would pay for a large outdoor run,  he agreed and did his chores and for his birthday I paid for 2 Guinea pigs from a local seller.


My son named the guinea pigs pudding and candy. 
Within days of buying them my son lost interest, he refused to feed them, refused to clean them and refused to move their run around the garden so they were on fresh grass.

I warned him multiple times that I would take possession of the pigs as my own, I discussed with my husband before we got them that I would quite enjoy having them in the garden as I had Guinea pigs growing up and always adored them.

So after a few months of doing 100% of the work myself I renamed the guinea pigs geralt and roach.


When my son was in the garden playing he heard me calling them to get them in the pen.
( I move them from the outdoor run and pen to the indoor shed pen at night) 
He threw an absolutely huge tantrum and demanded i change the names back.


I said if he began looking after them like he was supposed to that he could change the names back.


He continued to sulk and moan  but eventually agreed to these terms.


It's been a week since that tantrum and he hasn't been near them since, he sulks every day about the names but refuses to help.


my husband has told me to just change the names back and let it go, but I prefer those names and seeing as I'm doing all the work and I see them as my pets now not my sons why shouldn't I? 

I will gladly re think this situation if I am wrong or missing the point but I just don't think my husbands point Is very fair,  my son needs more discipline already as he seems to be so demanding and sulky lately AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my mom to cover my daughter's chest in pictures,"My daughter is 17 months old. Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.

My mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up.

AITA for walking out of an intervention my family surprised me with?,"Basically, I think everyone’s overreacting.

I’m 23 and I got incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning. I do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. 

I spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. It was a one time stupid mistake. 

Yesterday, I went over to my parent’s house for dinner. 

When I walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody I’d never seen before.

I asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. I did and the man I didn’t know started talking. 

To summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.

I got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. I said that I realized that I had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. I stood up and walked out at that point. 

My mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me. 

I said that everyone was acting crazy and I hopped in my car and went home. 

My brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but I haven’t answered. 

Everyone is crazy overreacting. Getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. It just happened once and I regret it. I have a good job and I look after myself. I don’t think I need rehab or that intervention. 

That said, maybe I did handle the intervention the wrong way. I maybe could’ve responded in a way that made them feel better instead of blowing up.

AITA for refusing to dry my bras in my bedroom and telling my flatmate that she and her bf need to grow up?,"Obligatory throwaway so men don’t message me about my tits on my regular account + I’m on mobile, so sorry if formatting is weird.

So, the other day one of my flatmates (with whom I have, up until this point, had neither a positive nor negative relationship with) sent me this long text that started with “we need to talk about the laundry situation.” This was a bit confusing, since I wasn’t aware of any particular laundry situation. The rest of the text was her telling me that I need to keep my bras out of the laundry room because apparently, when she had her boyfriend over, he went in there and saw my bras hanging up to dry on the drying rack, and was so shocked?intrigued?whatever that he checked the fucking tags (I have no idea if this is normal male behavior, but it creeped me out to read) to see the size, and then “wouldn’t stop talking about it.” 

I responded with, basically, “then tell your boyfriend to keep his hands off my shit and shut up.” Flatmate did not consider this an adequate response, and told me that I should keep my “pornstar bras” in my room because it’s apparently inappropriate to dry them in the laundry room. At this point I was quite annoyed; I don’t wear “pornstar bras,” I just have very large breasts, and they’re a literal constant source of annoyance and back pain. The bras in question were totally normal, but apparently them being a UK 34H makes them inappropriate. I told her that I’m not going to try to dry my bras in my room since it’s tiny and we have a perfectly good drying rack in the laundry room, which is for laundry, and that both she and her boyfriend needed to get over it and grow up. I know that this wasn’t terribly diplomatic, but I felt like she was much ruder than I was. I didn’t really think about it the next day, but now it’s been three days and she’s completely ignoring me, so I’m wondering if I misjudged the situation. AITA?

EDIT/UPDATE: 
1. thank you all for your feedback. I very much appreciate all of you who assured me that the boyfriend is creepy and that I wasn’t overreacting, because I was starting to feel like I was in some twilight zone where it’s just normal for random men to be examining my bras.

2. As many of you have pointed out, yes, we are supposed to be sheltering in place and her boyfriend should not be coming over anyway. This is part of why I wasn’t feeling very charitable from the start. I don’t want to get sick but she insists her boyfriend is “safe.”

3. Regardless, I decided to reach out to her again and be a bit nicer. Like many of the commenters, I was also pretty sure this was a jealousy issue, and even though she’s annoying, I know feeling bad about your body sucks. Since she clearly doesn’t want to talk to me, I texted her again and told her that I’m sorry that her boyfriend is making her feel bad about herself, and that I think it’s completely out of line for him to talk about my body, as it’s disrespectful to both of us. I reiterated that I’m going to continue drying my bras on the drying rack because it’s the most logical place to dry them, and that I need her to tell her boyfriend to not touch my things, but that if she’s open to it, I’d like for us to have a conversation about body image and guys, as I’ve dated men before who’ve made me feel weird about my body or who couldn’t keep their eyes and hands to themselves. She hasn’t responded yet, but hopefully she’ll ditch him.

4. Seems that there are many large-breasted women in these comments. If any of you aren’t already familiar, I highly recommend a) using the size calculator on r/abrathatfits and asking the extremely knowledgeable women there for help in finding bras that are comfortable and don’t break the bank, and b) abandoning American bras forever because they suck and have a tiny size range.",Not the A-hole
AITA using my son's college fund to remodel my home?,"I have consistently put money away for my kids' college funds since they were young. Their education was important to me. I worked very hard to get my degree and eventually my Master's. I didn't want my kids to be burden or worried about funds when they went to school. My son got into a decent school and started off well. Then his grades slumped and he said he was dropping out. He's now 23 and has been bouncing from one odd job to the next.

He took some blue collar job and moved out with his girlfriend who is a waitress.. Long story short, they ended up getting married. Then they BOTH lost their jobs. I wasn't worried about it because they always seem to have money for sporting games, home decor, etc. My son told me that he and his wife were FLAT broke and severely in debt. True, they worked long hours but they still weren't making enough to support their lifestyle and it's important to them to do fun things together. That is the crux of their relationship because they are both very social and fun people. He also mentioned that their home needed repairs and both needed new cars.

My son asked me to let him tap in what remained of his college fund to help them get out of debt, fix their home and cars. There is about 45K left. I told him no. That money was for COLLEGE and not some newlywed slush fund. He had two years to go back to college and he decided he didn't want to. As I saw it, he forfeited that money and I want to use it to remodel my house. I bit my tongue when he got married, dropped out of school, took dead-end jobs, etc. but I am not bailing him out this time.

Edit: I couldn't care less what his wife does. Point is that she was making as much money as the person who started months before and she's been there three years. Dead. End. Job. And my son was a ""process engineer"" or whatever the fuck that is. His place got shut down too.

Edit 2: My son called me saying his wife's restaurant is closing permanently. She worked at the Soup Plantation.

WIBTA if I refused to be part of the my inlaws family tradition?,"My husband and i have been together for almost 6 years. Married for 3. We have a 1 year old. I love his family but I struggle with the differences in how they treat their son (my SO) vs their daughter (SIL). Anything she wants she gets. I don't start drama however I will stand up for what I think is right and it occasionally causes tension.

They have a wonderful tradition where they create a picture calendar for their grandma for Christmas. Every month highlights the people whose anniversaries or birthdays it is. The rest filled in with loving memories. Since we got married I am now in a couple of the photos. I felt loved to have been included in such a tradition but last year caused issues. Our sons birthday and our anniversary fall on the same month (no else shares anything special with this month). His parents told us we could design that page with the 3 of us however we like. I choose 4 photos. One of our son just born, one of us as a family, one of him with his (great) grandma, and one of just my husband and I. We create the page and send it. We stop by one night to continue helping them (my husband is better at doing it online than them) when I realize my SIL has swapped out one of my photos for a picture of her with my son. I made a comment about how that is not what we designed and she tells me she likes it that way and wants to use that photo.

At this point in time she is in roughly 75%of the photos/book. 
12 months each with 4 pictures per page = 48 photos. 
She is in almost 36 photos out of 48. Has a whole page dedicated to just her. And a good portion of her photos are of just her. I suggest she take out of her photos from a previous month and use that one instead. I then changed it back to the photo I wanted.

She ushers us out for the house. Christmas comes around and the calendar is brought out. She had changed it back to the photo she wanted. I was furious but let it go because 
1) It was for grandma who I adore 
2) We didn't pay for it, his parents did and SIL chipped in a little bit (we offered)

This year I offer to help with the calendar again and get told she has a special idea for this year. She wants to do recreation photos (take an older photo and using the same people take the photo again) I think its a great idea and understand that it means my son and I won't be in it. I'm sad but still offer to help. She declines.

Then I find out she wants to do half the book with special recreation. She wants to take some of grandmas old photos and use the new gen to recreate them. I think this is great and now my son and i can at least be in one photo.

Nope.
She wants to be her grandma in every shot. Wants to use my SO as grandmas husband and my son as my FIL as a baby. 
They have no use for me. I mention this makes me upset and I want to be part of this tradition and upon her parents pushing she tells me I can take the group family photos.

WIBTA If I tell them no? That if I cant be in it I don't want anything to do with it?

UPDATE:
Wow this has taken off! Thanks for all the love💙 So a few hours after I posted my SO came home for lunch and inquired as to why my phone was blowing up. I told him. He was pissed. Turns out SIL told him a little about the ideas and that the whole family was involved. He assumed that meant me. He is now refusing to do anything unless I'm part of it and that our son will not be in anything unless we are a part of it (unless it's a gen pic-ie Grandpa with grandson). Said i am his most important family 🥰. Now he wants nothing to do with the calendar. I am trying to talk him into talking to his parents first as this is a lovely tradition. I just want to be a part of it too.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling one of my bridesmaids to take her glasses off during photos?,"I am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. 

Her name is Tara, and she is stunning. She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. Her eyes can't tolerate contacts.

In our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, I asked if it was possible for Tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. I wasn't saying this to be cruel. I'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but I'm just asking her to take them off during photos. Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

I brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour. Without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so I would have thought she'd be OK with it.",Asshole
AITA for not telling my roommate about my “vag*na razor”,"*I know it’s not technically the vagina, but that’s what it’s being referred to* 

I (F21) live with two roommates, R and M  (both also F21). 

R has a bad habit of using M and my stuff, which wouldn’t really bother me except she leaves containers of things open, and never put anything back where she found it. Normally she sticks to using some lotion or face wash and stuff like that. 

Now, the situation:

I have two razors. One I use for legs/armpits. And the other I use to shave my pubes (from here on out this will be referred to as the “vagina razor”). The razors are different colors so I don’t confuse them, and I usually keep them in my drawer in the bathroom (each of us have one drawer and one shelf in the cabinet for our own stuff).

Last night I used my vagina razor while in the shower, and when I was out, I set it on the bathroom counter to dry before I put it back in the drawer. I did my skin care routine and brushed my teeth, and I ended up forgetting to put it back, so it was left on the counter and I forgot about it until about an hour ago.

I went to take a shower and saw my vagina razor in the shower on a small shelf in there. When I picked it up, I noticed that it was all gross and covered in hairs and shaving cream. That’s when I remembered I had left it out on the counter. 

I get out of the shower and take the razor to the living room where R and M are watching a movie and asked if anyone used my razor. R casually says she did, so I tell her she owes me a new blade. R says no, that it’s “just legs” and I’m being dramatic. But I’m literally so grossed out at this point because who the fuck shares razors? No matter what they’re used for??

I tell her I don’t use the razor on my legs, I use it to shave my pubes and R starts freaking out. She starts yelling, calling me gross, disgusting, etc, and saying that I should have told her that before. I tell her she shouldn’t have used my stuff. 

R texts basically all our friends, and their opinions are divided. While most agree that R shouldn’t use our stuff without asking, they also think I should have told R what I use the razor for, since I know she uses our stuff. R’s girlfriend called me disgusting because according to her, I let R “rub my vagina” on her legs, which is just, insane. 

I’ve been getting text messages from our mutuals telling me I should have told R since I “know how she is”. But I don’t agree; none of this would have happened if she didn’t use my stuff.

AITA here?

EDIT: I’ve been speaking to our friends and showed my roommates this thread. M is 100% on my side (as has been the whole time) but R is still upset that she used my vagina razor on her legs and is acting huffy and annoyed, she also says I shouldn’t have left the razor out on the counter either since that’s also gross (it was face up, so the actual razor wasn’t touching the counter but I digress). Also learned that apparently she fudged the story a bit and told our mutual friends that she had used my razor but that the blade had been new, and that I was freaking out and being a drama queen. I still don’t understand how this is any better because either way she would have used MY razor, but whatever. I’ve started sending the link to this post to our friends and now most of them seem to be on my side, but also feel bad that R is upset 🙄 Hopefully y’all are right and she stops using my stuff after this.

EDIT2: Since some people are asking; I use two separate razors so the vagina razor stays sharper longer since I shave that area less often than legs/armpits. Also, I have taken your advice and removed all my products from out bathroom and will now be taking everything in and out of there with me as needed.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I (37f) tell my husband (38m) that he can follow the event dress code or just stay home?,"My side of the family is very close and ~~my~~ our niece (call her N) is getting married in a few months. The ceremony is halfway across the country and I've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. The venue is upscale and beautiful.

The ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the [""cocktail"" definition here](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

Husband doesn't *dress up*. He wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. He wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (That was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

When I broke the news about N's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""No. I'm not wearing a suit. I guess I'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

I told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. I added ""Nice priorities there, honey.""

* My mom and brother (N's dad) said YTA - just ask N if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* N's mom says I'm NTA, but my delivery could have been better (I disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* I don't have very many friends to ask, and I'm NOT asking N. Weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

What do you think?

Edit: This got bigger than anticipated. And my very first silver and gold! Thank you all! I don't know how I'll get through all your responses, but I'll do my best.

I really don't care that he's jeans, t-shirts and boots. We live in small town in the Midwest. Preachers and undertakers wear suits here.

I just need him to not be so inflexible on something so stupid. You'd think I was asking him to kick puppies or cannibalize small children.

Last Edit: I shouldn't have posted his uncensored pic. I removed the link, but we all know the internet lives forever. So I'll fess up about this entire post, but won't be bitchy about it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for spending my Sons lottery winnings money?,"I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200B;

I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200B;

Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200B;

Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing ""his"" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for being upset about a ""prank"" my girlfriend pulled on me?","This past Friday, my girlfriend and I had a small get together at our apartment where I proceeded to get very drunk. I'm not a very experienced drinker. My girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. The next morning, I wake up very hungover and thirsty. I see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says ""water"" on it. I thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? Very thankful that I didn't have to get up to get water, I proceed to chug the ""water"" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. At that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. 

I felt very bad, I didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so I got up and cleaned everything up even though I felt like dog shit. She denied putting the ""water"" there so I just thought one of our friends did it. It was a shitty thing to do, but I got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an Instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. It shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says ""hair of the dog"" then howls.

I confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. I told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. It was a very cruel thing to do. She said I was overreacting and being sensitive.

AITA for my sister and her bf breaking up?,"sister, teri
sisters bf, tom

so I'm most likely the asshole but here we go. 

so my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. 

now a few dates in Tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. 
teri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. 

last week I found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.
I thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. 

she complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. I asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would I want fucking crotch goblins living with me. I then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. 
so I asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. 

I told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. 

I then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more. (he has monthly drug tests)

I automatically called him and let him know and provided proof with the photo. 

tori is now a single woman and is fucking pissed at me, my mum has also taken her side and now I'm regretting it.

AITA for not leaving my parking spot because someone honked at me?,"Hello

So on my (19m) trip to the grocery store, I ended up scoring a non-handicapped parking spot right by the front of the store..

It's super hot here, so I decided to grab an ice cream bar. I was unwrapping it in my car, fully intending on driving off once opened (so I could eat and drive), when some old jerkoff starts honking at me and wildly gesturing at me to get out of the spot. 

Now, if I had been eating a meal or something I would've understood their frustration, but I had been in the car maybe 30 seconds. He rolled down his window and started yelling at me, at which point I turned off my car, and settled in to eat my ice cream. 

It caused a pretty big scene, as he ended up getting out of his truck (leaving it in the parking lot, not parked lol) and yelling at me, calling me names, swearing, all of it.

After I finished my ice cream, maybe five minutes later, I waited for him to ""do a loop"" looking for another spot, and promptly reversed, allowing someone else to take the spot. 

I felt pretty justified with that reaction, but when I told my mom she was disappointed, saying that I caused an entire commotion for no reason.

AITA for having sex with my sister in law on the wedding night.,"Hey reddit,

I was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  I am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  We really hit it off right away.  We study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

Day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  I said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  He said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""This is my day, I can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" This shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

Wedding was going well and I obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but I said no.  She looked hurt and confronted me when I was getting a drink.  She said ""We were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  I really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  I said yes, and apologized and we danced.  

My dad forcibly tried to pull me off the dancefloor but i ignored him,  I got a text from my brother during the party that I was not to talk to her.  I replied dude wtf i get its your day but whats the deal?  We ended up making out after my brother left with his bride to the hotel.  We went back to the hotel holding hands, and laughing and we finally kissed.  Well we had sex in my room and i got her number and we are going to have a real first date this week.

I got a text from my brother later that day that his new wife told him what happened and he was extremely angry and couldn't believe I was so selfish.   My dad threw a fit when he found out and said he won't pay for my wedding when it happened.  I told him idc because i have a good job now.

AITA for not building a relationship with my dad's affair partner / new wife?,"I am in my second to last year of high school and last year I found out that my dad was cheating on my mom with an employee of his. I told my mom because I knew my dad would never own up himself, and they got divorced. During the divorce, my mom was having a hard time coping and turned to drugs, and she got found out, now my dad has custody and I only have visits with her. 

It's all been really hard on me, and on my mom, and I resent my dad and how everything seemed to work out for him. He's married his employee and she's pregnant and living with us.

Anyway, I've been polite to her because I don't want to screw myself over and make my dad too angry to pay for college. But it's the kind of ""nice"" I put on at my customer service job, a smile and pleasantness, but not actually getting to know her personally. It's hard for me to even do that, it's like a lot of emotional labor that I don't want to be doing in addition to school and work.

Like for example, the kinds of stuff I'll say...

If she asks me about school, I'll be like ""It was nice, we had a nice lecture on genes in class"" or she asks me about my teachers and I'll be like ""they're nice, they all seem very smart"" or she'll ask me about a movie I saw and I'd be like ""It was good and funny"" 

Just like trying to be positive and polite. But last week, she lost it at me and was like ""Why is everything NICE with you? How's school? NICE. How's work? NICE. Your father says you hate your science teacher, but all you ever say to me is that everything's NICE like a broken record"" and I was like ""sorry. I really do mean it, school has been good"" 

Anyway, later my dad talked to me and said not to play dumb, he knows I don't really think all my teachers are nice, don't like the actor in the movie I saw, don't really mean all the stuff I'm saying. And he and his wife can tell, and it's hurting because they both want me to be genuine.

I said ""ok I'll try"" but TBH it is tiring enough for me to just be polite let alone genuine. Plus I feel like I'm genuine, and talk about what's actually on my mind, such as my mom, and being worried about her, it will go over even worse

AITA for kicking my sister out of my wedding during the reception?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I got married last Saturday. Hooray for me! My sister was my maid of honor. During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how “in that moment, I knew he was the one for throwaway...” (so cliche!). I thought her speech was really selfish. I think it’s super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how “strong” she was. Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! Sorry if I sound selfish, but IMO there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. She was really upset but just left without arguing. My parents agree with me. but my husband and all of my close friends think I was way too harsh. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for yelling at a friend when she said that I should think about cancelling my wedding because my fiancée has recently become disabled,"My fiancée and I are planning on getting married in September, and we’ve been together for 5 years now. A month ago she got into an accident that has her in a wheelchair. She’s been seeing a physical therapist about prosthetics but for now at least there’s no walking happening.

It’s been... an adjustment for both of us, and I won’t say it’s gone perfectly, but you can’t expect something like this to transition perfectly. I recently went out with a couple friends, and I was talking about my fiancée and how she was doing when one of them asked if I had thought about calling off the wedding.

I immediately said no and asked why I would, and she started talking about how she’s going to be a burden and I don’t want to start the better part of my life with dead weight as a wife.

This really pissed me off and I yelled at her that just because she got into an accident doesn’t make her worthless and that she should shut her mouth if only shit is going to come out of it. I’ll admit I made a bit of a scene, so I left and went home.

My fiancée says that I shouldn’t have been so harsh and that she can see where my friend is coming from and that she only has my best interests in mind. This honestly really surprised me since my friend was talking about her, and she’s saying I should have been less harsh. So I’m wondering whether I went overboard since the woman getting trashed even thinks I was too harsh.

AITA for dming a girl who bullied me relentlessly in high school regarding her instagram post?,"So I’m (21f) Asian. I went to a predominately white high school full of rich kids who were racist and super snobby. This one girl, we’ll call her B, bullied me relentlessly in high school and would make fun of my eyes (she would pull her eyes back when she saw me), call me Ling Ling, chink, ask me if Kim Jong Un was my dad, tell me to stop eating dogs, etc. All unprovoked, and I never said anything back because my Korean parents always told me to swallow my pride and take it.  She’s basically the worst human I know and she is part of the reason why I resented my asian heritage for so long.

I don’t follow her on social media because I don’t follow people I don’t care to keep up with.  She’s trying super hard to be an “influencer”, and there has been this trend going around called the “fox eye trend” where girls will pull their eyes back just like they would when they mock asian eyes in the attempts to look more “chic”. While this trend has made me upset because the feature I could not control and was teased for my entire life is now being considered sexy when non asian girls do it, I realize I don’t have much control over things like this so I just ignore it.

B posted a picture in this pose, pulling her eyes back, with some caption along the lines of “am I bella hadid yet?” 
This pissed me off (admittedly more than it should have) because she looked no different from when she pulled her eyes back to mock me. I saw the post because my friend, who was always there to listen to me when I was hurt by B, sent it to me, and we had talked about the fox eye trend a couple days ago. I then   in the heat of the moment dmed B saying “no, you don’t look like bella hadid, you look like the racist you are.. but like.. chic!”. She read the message, said “what the fuck..?”, and took down the post (I should make it clear that there were some comments NOT FROM ME on her post about the fox eye thing being problematic. I wasn’t the only asian she bullied). Now I feel bad for making a big deal out of something that might have been nothing.

Edited because I realized I was kind of rambling lol.
ALSO: Just to clarify for those who keep saying to stop looking at her posts: Again, I don’t. I haven’t since I left high school because I don’t care.

AITA for asking for the $500 reward money after I returned a lost cat?,"My wife and I live in a very walkable area. We were walking to lunch the other day and noticed a few reward posters for a lost cat. We were talking about the lost cat as we walked because we have a few cats and always joke about how we are crazy cat people (we are in our 30's).

Well sure enough we see this cat just sitting on the roof of a car and it looked just like the one in the reward poster. I walked up to it and it was super nice. I took a pic of it then we walked a block back to the poster to compare. It was the same cat. We went back and got the cat. It was real nice and let me pick it up. It just cuddled up. I think it was pretty scared. My wife called the number on the poster and they gave us their address and walked the cat 4 blocks to the house.

As we were walking up the sidewalk the kids in the house ran out and screamed in a happy way and grabbed the cat. The parents came out and thanked us for returning their cat. The mom had tears in her eyes. As they were walking back inside I said, ""oh, I noticed there was a $500 reward. Would that apply in this situation? If not, I totally understand."" The dad just looked at me with daggers and the wife looked real confused. She said in a kinda condescending way, ""you really want us to give you $500?"" I said, ""I'm not trying to be awkward or anything, but you did offer a reward and we did find your cat."" The dad said, ""Jesus, hold on"" and went inside and got $320. He comes back outside and said, ""All I have is $320 cash on hand. I can get you the rest if it's really that big of a deal to you."" I said, ""no, that's fine and he handed me the $320."" As they walked back inside the wife said under her breath, ""I can't believe he took the money"" and the husband said, ""yeah, what a dick."" They clearly said it loud enough for me to hear.

My wife is totally on my side. We live in a pretty affluent area so $500 (or $320) isn't a big deal to these people. I mean they had two Mercedes in their driveway nor is that money a big deal for me. However they did offer a reward and we did our part. I told my friends at lunch that day and half think I was right to ask for it. The other half said I should have just ""done the right thing"" and not asked for it.

Edit: My wife's and my parents think I should have just given the cat back with no reward. They think I was totally the asshole for asking for the reward.

AITA for walking out of a gender reveal party?,"My wife (34) and I (33) are having our second child. We have a daughter (5). 

She’s been grouchy her whole pregnancy so her sister offered to plan her a gender reveal party. 

The plan was that all the food and decorations would be blue or pink and in the end we’d get one of those special sparklers that would light 
up in either blue or pink to reveal the gender. 

We went to the doctor and got her to write the result in a folded piece of paper that we passed over to her sister without looking.

So flash forward to the day of the party and the moment of truth comes and the sparkler turns out to be pink for a girl.

I don’t know what came over me but all I felt at that moment was very bitter disappointment. To be honest, all I was hoping for for baby #2 is to be able to toss a ball around with him and coach little league. Or watch him go on Boy Scouts camping trips. 

I know my daughter is only five, but I’ve already started to deal with the dramas of being a father of a girl and the thought of having to double up now on the neuroticism was harrowing.

I grew up in a house with three older boys and one younger sister and I can’t imagine seeing myself be outnumbered.

My wife grabbed my arm as people were approaching us to say their congratulations and said I needed to look happier. At that moment I just snapped. I shook my head and walked out to my car ( we came separately) and drove to my sister’s (21F) house.

I start getting texts from my sister in law and my wife saying “ way to reenact” their dad leaving their mom when they were 10 and 12. 

I felt like that accusation was unfair and that I just needed some time alone. I didn’t ask to be flabbergasted- it just happened. And I don’t think it’s fair that they would have demanded I smile and nod for the next couple of hours.

AITA for saying my autistic older brother can't stay with me during holidays anymore?,"Please excuse the bad formatting as i am on mobile.
For back story i grew up with my brother i (25f) and him (31m) so i know he can be challenging. I have always tried to have patience with him as i know he can't help doing some things due to his autism.
So this weekend i said him and my sister could stay at my house (the live over 4 hours away) i took the day off work to prepare for them despite needing the money. My sister calls around the time they should have been arriving to say my brother is throwing a fit and no longer wants to come to family Christmas. I understand i know how hard traveling and not having a set schedule is for him.
Fast forward 5 hours they finally show up at 11pm.
The second he walks in the door he starts screaming for me. I run over to see what he needs and if he's okay. He immediately ask where he can plug in his laptop and starts gaming. 10 minutes later he's complaining my house is to cold. I already have the heater higher then i want it and everyone else in the house is comfortable. So i give him an extra blanket and go to bed. He stayed up all night playing loud games and kept me awake. I asked him to go to bed multiple times. Then at 6am he comes in my room without knocking and ask for breakfast. I tell him to make cereal because i need sleep. I hear him scream and low and behold he has dropped my good glass mixing bowl on the floor and there's glass and milk everywhere. I'm 5 months pregnant have no sleep am hot (he turned my thermostat up to 82) and now have to clean this mess. I clean it up shower and tell him to be ready to leave in 20 minutes for my grandparents. My sister (22f) gets him his things then heads to my grandmas. I go to leave with him and he has gone to sleep. We were 3 hours late to Christmas because he refused to get up. We finally get there and my grandparents yell at me for bringing him late. I start crying and tell everyone I'm never keeping my brother at my house again and someone else can do it next time.
Now my family says I'm being an over emotional ah.
So AITA here?

Edited because i forgot to add. We no longer have parents my mom passed last year and my father left when we were young. My brother having autism and my sister being epileptic (she would have weekly seizures as an infant and small child) was to much for him.
Second edit to say thank you all for the outpouring support. I really thought a few people would think i was wrong but everyone here has been kind and helpful instead. We will be contacting his social worker and therapist first thing monday morning and looking into other resources for him. We just want what's best for him and this post has shown me we might have originally made the wrong choice.
I want to thank everyone for the advice and support.
Edit 3 i am trying to respond and read all the comments and give replies to questions. I have gotten over 600 comments. 
I only have the 1 sister.
She is the care giver because she volunteered as she has a stay at home husband who can help 24/7.
I am pregnant but divorced my husband 2 months ago so he is not in the picture. 
I want to thank everyone who recommend resources and i will be sitting down with my family and social worker to look into different,better options.",Not the A-hole
AITA for walking out of my own birthday.,"so my birthday was 3 days ago, mum asked me last month my plans for it and I said that I would love for me mum dad and brother to go to a nice restaurant and have dinner, she agreed and thought it was a great idea. 
I made a point of saying that all I want is us to celebrate ny birthday and I do not want anyone else to join us. 

I get a text from my mum to tell me to get to her place at 5 (this was 2 days ago) and so I got ready and headed off. I get to the house and noticed that the lights where all off but walked in anyways. all I hear is SURPRISE and around 20/30 people leap out to surprise me. 
when I looked around the room I noticed that most of the people who where there where not my friends but my mums friends, like people from her church and job. 

I looked quite shocked and pulled mum to the side and told her how much I did not want this and asked her why her colleagues and friends were at MY birthday party, she claimed that she wanted more people to surprise me. so I asked if we were going to head to the restaurant and she told me that we would be having a bbq here. 

I said nope and walked out the door got in my car and drove home  

I ruined the party and my mum has been a trainwreck.

AITA for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew?,"Throwaway cause reasons.

Backstory: my wife and I have two kids (9F, 4M). My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an ""oops"" baby. She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. No major complications or anything like that. 

On the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.

So last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. 

While I said that I agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

Well she took this as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?

(Also, please don't reply with ""YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR"". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)

Edit title: Nephew :/

Edit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

Edit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... But I didn't really ""take a side"", at least I wouldn't consider it that. It's not like I said, ""Well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". It was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update if anyone is interested.

Edit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. I was merely saying that due to those circumstances I could more easily empathize with my SIL's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend""","I've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (M18) (F17). Since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. Shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

A few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like ""Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

I eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend. 

Things eventually escalated and I left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. 

Am I in the wrong? I don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.

AITA for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?,"My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. 

My boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

I went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of ""I couldn't help it!"" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

He seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

I realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

Am I the asshole?

UPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

When he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

AITA for getting upset at a couple sitting in my seats?,"Context: I bought two $124 tickets to an NBA game for a friend and I. We decided that we would watch the first 2 quarters, get up at halftime for the bathroom and food, and then make it back before the 3rd quarter started. 

When we got back from the bathroom, there was a couple in our seats (no big deal). But they were eating those stadium peanuts that make a MESS, and guess what? I am deathly allergic to peanuts. 

Me: “Excuse me you’re in our seats, can you guys please get up?

Guy: “Oh yeah my bad”

That’s when I see how much of a mess is EVERYWHERE. Our seats are literally the only 2 in the row. A row of JUST 2 seats. And this guy and his wife just have 2 bags worth of peanut debris and dust all over our chairs. We were gone for maybe 15 minutes. 

Me: “Dude really? I’m allergic to peanuts and you have absolutely trashed our seats”

Guy: “How am I supposed to know that?”

Me: “You’re not! You only know that because you are in MY seats that I paid for making a mess with peanuts, now please leave!” ( a little rude but I was heated)

Guy: “Don’t talk to me like that”

Me: “Or what? 

He just stared at me as security led him towards the tunnel. The guards were very apologetic and thankfully got a janitor surprisingly fast to clean it all up. My friend says I was an asshole though. I thought I handled it well? I don’t carry an epipen on me either, I was paranoid the rest of the night about a nut exposure. 

So lay it on me, am I the asshole?

EDIT: people seem to not understand peanut allergies, so here’s an ELI5: if you ingest a peanut, your body goes into immune overdrive, essentially killing you while thinking it’s defending. If it touches your skin (depending on your severity) you will break out into hives which in my opinion from the time I did eat nuts, was the worst part of it all. No I won’t die, but I was scratching myself until I was bleeding once. EATING and TOUCHING nuts with an allergy is different.

WIBTA if i failed a Juniors probation period because he's reported me several times to the bosses?,"This is a weird one.

I work in a digital agency, we hired a 19 year old to pick up and learn how our business works for our digital sector. I'm the manager of the digital department, i have a team of about 8 members, we're a close group as most of us have been working together for over 5 years. I've been here for 8 and i've been with the company since it was only 6 of us. We're now a business of over 70 people.

This 19 y/o that we hired is a big clients son. My boss who is good friends with the client offered him the job (subject to probation period) without us posting anything online for people to apply. I am the one that trains him up and i will be the one to approve his probation period, but i'm not sure if hes aware of that as my boss is the one that hired him.

This 19y/o was meant to start in March but then lockdown hit so we pushed it back a month, we thrived during the lockdown and thus needed more resource, so we took him on in April - It was challenging training someone through Microsoft Teams but he was picking up things very quickly, i'd say that we spent a good 2 hours a day on a call together. We got on pretty well and i liked him.

After the first 2 months, he was fitting in well and it was all good. Our digital department had a quiz night a few days before we were planning on coming back into the office. Since a lot of the digital guys  know my partner, i invited my partner to the quiz. I'm guessing that the new Junior didn't know i was gay as i'm considered very ""straight passing"". The quiz went well and we all had a laugh.

Now, last week we were in the office and i immediately got pulled into the the HR's room. I know most of the HR people well and some of us are friends outside of work. ""Someone"" had reported me of trying to make a pass at them on Microsoft Teams meetings. They were time stamped and its very clear that it was the Junior. I told them that nothing at all happened and i didn't make a pass at all (The HR lady knows me well, and knows i'm not into anyone younger than me at all). It was kind of left at that.

Yesterday, i got called into the HR office again, this time i was reported for the same thing but i was also reported for leaving the office early on friday (half hour early, but i confirmed with my boss before hand). I'm now under investigation for sexual harassment, although my HR representative said i shouldn't worry as she doesn't think anything will come of it since i literally haven't done anything.

Now, i'm not meant to know who this person is but i know 100% that its the Junior who is reporting me (my HR friend heavily hinted to me). This is his last week of probation, a lot of the digital guys aren't fond of him, and i can fail his probation based on ""Failure to work collaboratively"" but he's a pretty good worker. I'm not worried about the sexual harassment investigation since i have nothing to hide.

WIBTA for terminating his probation?

**EDIT:**

A colleague has found the Juniors twitter (same username as his instagram and same dp) where he has stated multiple homophobic tweets - one that was posted a week ago that seems possibly directed at.about me. This has gone into my document which i will be showing to my boss on Thursday, i have asked for the HR rep that is handling the case to join.

I'm feeling a lot better about this situation and feel like it will work out for the best for me.

**EDIT 2:**

So the title is stupid, i apologise for that, it definitely makes it seem like i'm failing him purely based on him going against me. Terribly worded.

AITA for locking my wife out of my office because she won't stop bothering me?,"I have been studying for a very important test each night for the past few weeks. I usually wait until after dinner before I start, which usually is around 9 - 10 PM, and then I will work until 1 -3 AM. It depends on how much I get done. 

My wife doesn't usually go to bed until 11 PM, and at that time of night she likes to be close to me and cuddle, so she has been coming into my office and hanging out with me while I work. 

This was fine for a few days, but then it seemed like every night she would go from cuddling me to trying to make out with me and have sex. More often than not we would and my schedule would suffer as a result. 

I asked her not to keep doing this because she knows it's hard for me to turn her down, and she promised she would stop, but she didn't and the same pattern repeated itself. 

I have fallen behind my schedule now by a lot, and I have asked her to please not do this anymore if she is going to come into my office. She swore to me again she would not try to initiate, and she still did. 

I didn't know what else to do since talking to her failed, so tonight when I went into my office to study I locked the door. When tried to come in like she normally does and found out it was locked she asked me to open the door and I refused. We had about a 45 minute conversation through the door before she finally went away in tears. 

I feel like the worst person in the world for making her so sad, but I don't know what else to do. She says she understands my issue and will do better, but she doesn't. I can't keep doing this for the next few months, so if she can't stop herself the only solution I have is to lock her out. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for defending my sisters period against my step mom even though I don’t have a period,"

I (16m) have a twin sister (16f). We live with our dad and step mom. Our dad is an essential worker so he’s out working most days, leaving our step mom.

My sisters periods are bad. She’s on medication to help with the flow of blood but she doesn’t have any prescribed pain killers. And her cramps are bad. She can barely move and sometimes she throws up. We have some off the counter pain killers that my dad got for her, which helps her a little.

When my sister has her period and cramps, she usually doesn’t leave her room. I’m normally the only one she will let into the room since were very close, so my step mom doesn’t fully understand how bad her cramps get. But I see them first hand. 

Only my dad and step mom know where her pain killers are as she’s too unorganised and would probably loose them. Every time she has a cramp, she tells me and I go ask my dad.

My dad was at work this time, so I asked my stepmom where the pills were and she started saying how my sisters such a drama queen. I didn’t really have time to argue with her since my sister was in her room in pain so I ignored it and just kept asking but she wouldn’t tell me. At this point I just called my dad, and he told me where they were and I got them for my sister.

I could have just left it there, but my step moms comments really annoyed me. I went back down stairs and called her a fucking dick because she didn’t just show me where the pills where. I told her she was out of place to deny my sister her pills and have to make me call my dad when he was at work, and that she should have just shut her entitled mouth up and told me (not word for word, I cursed a lot). She told me that a girl her age is just being dramatic, and everyone has cramps so she didn’t need to have the pain killers in case she became dependent. She told me she had cramps too and they went away by the time she hit 25 and she didn’t use and painkillers for them. I told her she had no idea what she’s talking about because she’s never actually seen the pain my sister goes through because she never bothers to check in on her. She told me to shut my mouth because she had more of an idea about what a period was like then I did because I’m just a boy. She told me if her period was really that painful, she would have come downstairs and asked for the pills herself. I told her she could barley move from the pain so of course I’m the one who has to be get them. At this point I was getting really mad, and I didn’t want our neighbours to here my yelling so I just went upstairs. I told my sister about the fight but she didn’t really give me an opinion on the fight since she was half asleep. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about it and I’m very sure I’m in the right, but I don’t want to act like I know everything about periods since I’ve never had one and she’s had many. AITA for arguing with my step mom about periods?




UPDATE:

My original post got a lot more attention than I expected. I want to answer some questions here and explain what happened after.

Some of you guys picked up, English is not my first language. Let me rephrase, my sister has been to a doctor. She has a condition which makes her bleed a lot. Her first period happened when she was 8 and lasted 3 weeks. She has been prescribed tranexamic acid tablets which helps the bleeding, so her periods last 10 days now. The doctors have done many tests on her including an ultrasound, she doesn’t have a cyst or anything, just really heavy bleeding. Thank you all for your concern and advice, but my dad has already taken her to the doctors. 

The pain meds she takes are over the counter ( I thought it was off the counter). It’s co-codamol. She hasn’t been prescribed pain killers from a doctor, I’m not sure as to why.

She has had her period for 6 years, we sort of developed a system as to how to get her pills. The tranexamic acid i keep in my room because she needs to take them 6 times a day everyday when she is on her period. The painkillers, she only takes them when she’s in pain, so I don’t keep them because she’s not in pain for the whole 10 days. My dad keeps them somewhere else. This post made me realise that this system is a bit dumb, so I now have both the painkillers and the tablets in the same place with me so I don’t have to ask anymore.

Yes, I could have not started an argument. That was on me, I’m the one who escalated things. In the heat of the moment I was disrespectful to my stepmom, but I still stand by what I said, although I’d should not have sworn and yelled. I told my dad what happened tonight, so now he’s having a serious sit down discussion with her, and he’s siding with me. He was very angry when I told him what happened as he too knows how much pain my sister is in. They’re talking right now. 

Last of all, I want to thank everyone for their comments and advice. I showed this post to my sister and she is very happy she has 10k+ redditors who are on her side. Thank you, kind strangers, for the awards. I appreciate them. I think that’s it, thank you again from both my sister and I.",Not the A-hole
AITA for throwing my boyfriend a Nailed It themed birthday for 2 last night?,"It was my boyfriend’s 36th birthday yesterday and I ended up crying like 5 times over the events that transpired.

He loves the show Nailed It and I thought it would be cute and fun to plan him “his own episode” with two cake challenges for just the two of us at home since we couldn’t go anywhere due to current circumstances. 

I put like 60 hours of planning into this day. I handmade umbrellas out of paper and toothpicks for drinks and drew a cartoon character he likes by hand on each one. I blew up those big gold number balloons with a straw. I batch made blue Hawaiians since he had wanted a tiki birthday. I got all the materials for a cupcake and full sized cake challenge that I carefully planned. I spent 2 days baking.

When it came time to play and I surprised him with the game (which would take 45min-1h), he sat there motionless and said he didn’t want to play and that his birthday always sucks and no one does anything for him and that he shouldn’t have to work on his birthday. He just wants to eat cake and this is a stupid idea. He likes to *watch* the show, he doesn’t want to actually try it. No one cares about him. He’s all alone on his birthday and didn’t get to see anyone, etc.

I cry about how I tried really hard and I’m sorry he thinks my idea is stupid but I thought he’d love it. He says I’m yelling and it’s not fair that he’s getting yelled at on his birthday. He leaves and slams the door to our bedroom. So I cry for like 10 minutes and then leave the apartment for a couple hours because I’m hurt. I return and he cries about being alone on his birthday. Then I make the cakes myself because I spent like $100 on the supplies and I thought someone should.

This morning he is crying again and saying all the same things. I told him I hear him, he didn’t like my idea but I tried and didn’t forget him. I really thought he’d like it. Then I cry because I tried and I’m hurt and he didn’t need to be so cruel about it. He states again his birthday always sucks, no one ever thinks of him, and I don’t listen to him or care about him. He didn’t get to see anyone (cause I don’t count as a person?) (note:he also got a lunch party from his sister and brother in law), his birthday sucked because he “got yelled at,” and he just wants one day where people think of him.

"AITA for telling my wife WE are making our daughter, not her?","Okay, so my wife and I are expecting our first child. She is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife’s medical issues caused the OBGYN to be extra cautious). 

During the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter’s different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. It was the first time we didn’t really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. My wife started crying, and I was comforting her, when she said the words. “I can’t believe I’m making a human being.”

I kept comforting her, but I waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. I also told her that saying she’s “making” the baby on her own is not accurate, since I provided half the genetic material. 

My wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking I don’t appreciate what she’s putting her body through to be pregnant. Obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that I’ve attended at least two doctors appointments every month. I show her with actions, not words, that I appreciate her. 

I just don’t think it’s fair to claim I haven’t contributed something to making our daughter. She is still upset the next day. So, AITA?

I was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

Obviously that didn’t work out because she got pregnant (I did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, I’m a dad now anyway)I asked her to abort, she told me she’d changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

I wasn’t thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established I set about paying child support and that was it. I had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and I was still a kid myself.

After a few months though I felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so I put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and I’m so glad and grateful that I got to be his dad.  I was 18 when I had him, and over the years I was lucky enough that I was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so I’m able to give my son experiences that I never had. 

He chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he’d always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he’d get yelled at because he’s the oldest, etc. 

His mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. She is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

It was his birthday last week and as a gift I bought him a car, which he’ll be needing soon anyway and which I’ve had the cash aside for for *years*. When his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me I that I’m a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because I’ve ‘never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it’s obvious his dad is spending money on him’ ... I snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids I have no obligation to just so she doesn’t feel bad? 

She said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that I was selfish for having a fund for ONLY my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. I told her that’s an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. 

She’s normally pretty level headed so I honestly have no idea why she thinks it’s acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- I’ve never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, I just want him to have the best I can give him.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling the cashier to fuck off and subsequently demanding her to get her manager because she had a condescending attitude towards me buying condoms?,"I’m really, really pissed off at this girl I just encountered and idk if I’m just being an immature teen or if I’m justified.  Basically I went to the Walmart down the street because I needed condoms. I’m 16 and have been told I have a baby face but I guess that’s just how it is.

The condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing I guess because of theft or something idk but I asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn’t doing anything if she could open it up. She made a comment “Aren’t you a little young to be needing those young man” which really caught me off guard and I sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and I just mumbled again that I needed them. 

She basically made a condescending exaggerated “hmfph” noise and said “I outta really call your mama and tell her what you’re doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don’t need to be using these” before moving towards the condoms. My mom and I go shopping here often so while I personally didn’t know this lady, it’s not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

Here’s where IDK if I’m TA because she WAS getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that I basically aggressive said “it’s none of your business for why I need these, fuck off and do your job”. She was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like “excuse me?” and I said “you heard what I said”. 

She said I’m not going to be doing anything and I needed to watch my mouth and she’s not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that’s when I got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so I said “Give me a manager if you don’t want to do your fucking job then” and she stammered before refusing, so I ended up asking another employee. 

Long story short I ended up getting the condoms, but I’m still so mad and upset that she essentially humiliated me in front of the entire store and my heart’s been racing the entire day. Did I handle the situation badly? AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister’s boyfriend that she’s been lying about her pregnancy and subsequently blowing up their relationship?,"So this is a doozy. Will keep details vague in case anyone recognizes us. 

So my older sister has severe issues, including some kind of undiagnosed psychosis and borderline personality disorder. 

Last year she started dating this really great guy that she met in her church group. He sort of knew about her issues but not completely. She was really good for a long long time. Then it fell apart a few months ago when they had some kind of massive fight over something and in an attempt to “win” the fight she told him she’s pregnant (she’s not). 

She confessed to me and our mom about it because she was scared that if she told him she actually lied in the heat of the moment he’d leave her. So she told my mom that she was gonna wait a few weeks then tell him she “miscarried.” I was really upset and told her this is messed up of her to lie like this, but both she and my mom agreed this was the only way to “keep” this guy around. 

Well it had been more than a few weeks but she hasn’t said anything to him. She was still pretending to be pregnant!!! And she said it’s getting harder to lie to him because he keeps trying to go with her to her “doctor’s appointments.” And during this time I suffered a lot of anxiety having to be in on this secret with both of them. 

So this is where I could be TA... last weekend my boyfriend and I were out shopping when we bumped into this guy in a parking lot. I had been avoiding him since this whole thing started because it made me sick to think about being dragged into it. He was really eager to chat with us and after a while I couldn’t help it and it all just came out. My bf was trying to calm me down but I literally sobbed and spilled everything and honestly it felt so much better just saying it out loud to anybody.

Long story short. I hear from my mom that he and my sister are obviously not doing well. Fighting all day, and she is no longer talking to me. My mom is so mad at me she said she can’t even look at me anymore. I feel immense guilt but also relief for no longer having to carry this secret but now I think my family will blame me for my sisters unhappiness forever. My mom still believes if we went along with my sister’s plan they would still be together.

My sister also told me she was apparently about to tell him about the miscarriage that afternoon and that I ruined everything by blabbing. I don’t know if she’s telling the truth but my parents certainly believe her.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not asking my singer friend to sing at our wedding/ refusing to allow her to ‘gift’ us her singing voice?,"This is very awkward and I’m not sure who to ask so I decided to post on here. 

My boyfriend proposed last year around Christmas, and of course I immediately said yes and together we have been very excitedly planning our wedding. We were due for September this year but have obviously put everything on halt. 

One of my friends, Abigail, is a singer. She has a very gospel-ly kinda voice but as awful as it sounds all I think when she sings is ‘this is warbly’ and I have to fight to keep a straight face. She’s not awful, but it’s really not my cup of tea. 

Obviously I would never say that to her but I do encourage her passion because one day she wants to turn her hobby into a career. I always respond in the group chat with constructive feedback when she sends us voice clips asking for it and if it’s very bad I’ll just stay quiet and not say anything at all. 

Now recently in January a little known music producer (I think) retweeted a video of her singing and she has taken this as her sign that she is about to break it big. 

She asked why I hadn’t asked her to sing in our wedding, and I answered honestly that I want her there in a friend capacity, not there to work. She then said she insisted on ‘gifting’ us the song to our first dance. 

I really, *really* don’t want her to do this so I told her I would need to square it with my fiancé as we are making all decisions together. Thankfully he was on board with me and I texted her ASAP to say that fiancé wasn’t keen on the idea because he *really* wants x band to play instead. 

She became upset in our chat group and quite a few of my friends are texting me telling me I should give her the platform and that I’m being a bad friend and an asshole, and that I’m being selfish.",Not the A-hole
AITA for donating sperm to one friend but not another?,"I (29M) am a gay man with many queer friends of various sexual and gender identities. I am in a long-term relationship and actually love other people's kids, but am uninterested in ever having my own children. 

Two years ago, one of my oldest, closest friends (a lesbian who we'll call M, now 30F) and her wife asked me if I would consider donating sperm so they could have a child. I love M as much as I love anyone, and was super honored that she'd asked. I said yes. M and her wife now have a lovely baby girl who I act as an ""uncle"" toward, and who I love very much in a ""this is not my child but I hope to know her for the rest of my life"" kind of way. 

About a month ago, another good friend (nonbinary, call them J, 28) and their partner (nonbinary, 33) told me that they were also interested in having a child. In case it's not obvious, they are both biologically female, so they can't have kids together lol. They told me that they were wowed by how well my decision to donate for M had worked out, and were hoping to do the same. They told me that they would be honored if I would consider it, and that they'd love it if I had the same sort of relationship with their child that I do with M's daughter. 

In the past, I have told many of my friends that I would be open to donating again, under the right circumstances, and in fact there is yet another lesbian couple that I'm quite close with that I've discussed donating to once they reach that point. Like I said, I love kids and as long as I'm not considered a ""father"" in any way, I don't mind spending ten minutes giving people I love the opportunity to live their domestic dreams. 

However, with J and their partner... if I'm being honest, I don't think they're ready to have children. The two of them have been off-and-on for several years, with both of them cheating on each other at various points (the last time being only about six months ago). I care about them both very much, but they're honestly pretty immature. I didn't feel comfortable with the idea of being involved with their (rash) decision to have a kid, so I told them that while I was honored they asked, I wouldn't be able to donate.

I didn't tell them why, but obviously they've heard me say before that I'd be down to donate again, so they were understandably surprised that I declined. After they pressed me for my reasoning, I told them that I didn't feel comfortable giving a child to a couple that I honestly didn't think were ready for it. They were very offended. They told me that it's not my place to judge whether they're ready for kids, and that it's messed up that straight couples can knock each other up whenever they want, but queer couples have to be considered ""worthy"" of it. 

Obviously, I'm under no legal or moral obligation to produce any child that I don't want to produce. But I do understand that I've really hurt my friends, and a lot of our extended friend group is super pissed at me rn, so I'm here looking for some perspective.",Not the A-hole
AITA for taking my step daughter to a new obgyn without telling her mother?,"I am married to my husband who  has a 17 year old daughter from his first marriage. We have been married for 4 years. 

To get things out of the way : my husband and I started dating well after he divorced his wife.

So we have her this month because her mother was diagnosed with the big C that is floating around while it was our week with step daughter.

TMI. She started her period last Thursday and it was bad. I am talking 3 days in bed, puking, cramps of hell. I had similar symptoms when I was her age and was diagnosed way to late with endo.

By day 3 I asked her if this was normal for her and she said that she always has very bad periods, but that her doctor told her it's normal because some women are just less pain resistant. I was alarmed and told her it was absolutely not like that and her pain was not normal and she needs to get a second opinion.
She asked me if I trusted my doctor and I told her yes. And she asked me if I could take her. I said of course and made an appt.

We got an appt the next morning and because my husband was away on business I texted him to tell him what step daughter wanted.

Next morning we go, I wait in the car. She comes back and breaks. Start crying saying that she felt so relieved that her pain is not normal and that while she gets screanings she got some pills to relieve her bleeding and pain (not contraception).

When we came back she seemed euphoric and was chatting with her mom. When she was done her mom called me back and was furious with me. I am talking... Screaming calling me names etc. She said it was not my place and that the only people that have a day in her health are her and my husband. That is was very creepy from me to talk about her privates when we are at home and she said that she was going to go to her lawyer to only let us get visitation.

I am stunned. My step daughter is old enough to make her own decisions regarding health... She is 17. She is not a baby. And I had no intentions but to help her because I went trough the same in my teens. I was not talking to her about her genitals. I was talking to her about periods... And I think that is pretty normal.

My husband says that he agrees with me. But he is my husband and clearly biased. I would like to know what I did wrong and if I am in the wrong to apologize to my stepdaughters mom.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for not apologising after I ""ruined"" my parents vow renewal?","Not a shitpost but definitely sounds like one so please suspend your disbelief and hear me out.

When I was 12 my parents divorced and began seeing other people.

When I was 14 dad met someone, ""Helen"". Helen had 3 sons. The oldest son, ""Jake"", was only a few months older than me. Of their 6 combined kids (I have 2 brothers) I was the only girl and was excluded a lot by dad, who would take all 5 boys to do ""guy stuff"" while I was left to my own devices. As a result, I only met my potential step brothers less than 5 times in the entire 2 years dad and Helen dated, and when I did it was all 8 of us at once, so there wasn't much 1 on 1.

When I was 16 dad proposed to Helen only to realise he still loved my mum. He and mum got back together shortly after, and remarried when I was 18.

When I was 25 I ended up indirectly working for Jake. We recognised each other and had a quick chat every now and again but due to the nature of my work we couldn't have any sort of relationship (including friendship) in case it looked like favouritism.

At 26 my contract ended and I moved to a new workplace. On my last day at my old workplace Jake asked if we could exchange numbers. We got together a few months later. We agreed to take it slow due to his son so it was very casual for the first few months and we only saw each other once or twice each month.

At 27 I tried to tell mum about Jake. Before I got to the part about him being Helen's son, mum started an argument because Jake has a kid, and I got so distracted by the arguing about Jake's son I didn't even get around to telling her who it was I was seeing. I called dad to try and tell him I was seeing Jake and he said he didn't want to hear whatever I had to say because I'd really upset mum and they'd contact me when mum was ready.

Now Jake and I are both 28, been together nearly 2 years. We moved in together last August. Mum sent me an invite to hers and dad's vow renewal back in January. Given current circumstances the renewal was moved online. I went into the office to take the call, logged in, greeted everyone, and found out a few people were late so we talked while we waited. During this Jake's son came in asking for help with his homework. Jake then came in to take him out, and dad saw him and went ""Jake?"". Mum said ""who's Jake?"". Dad said he was Helen's oldest son. Mum asked me what was going on and I told her we're a couple. Suffice to say, this was not taken well. Mum looked upset and physically left the room and dad apologised before ending the call and going after her. The call was still active and everyone else on it sort of said ""what the fuck OP?"" so I just awkwardly ducked out.

That was yesterday and since then I've recieved messages from everyone on the call (plus the ones who were late). They feel I should apologise for ""ruining"" their renewal.

I am an adult. I am sorry my parents were blindsided but I won't apologise for my relationship, plus if they'd heard me out 6 (edit: IDK when exactly, shortly after I moved in, possibly closer to 8 months?) months ago they wouldn't be blindsided now.

AITA for ghosting at parties?,"The other day I was at a BBQ and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me ""I have a bone to pick with you"". I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me.


""You don't say good-bye, you just leave"" is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think ""yeah I might go too"" ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear. 


Anyway I explained myself to this friend and she said ""no it's super rude"". We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.


tl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole?


Edit: I should note that I do try to tell the host I am leaving (if I can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not I text them to say thanks. It's just everyone else I'm trying to avoid.


Edit 2: she was not the host of this BBQ, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. I ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and I was 15 shades of fucked up.


Edit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked


Edit 4: TIL that this is called an Irish goodbye. Thanks for all of the support from fellow Irish goodbyers. Too all the people that think I'm rude, I accept that with open arms and will try tailor my approach a little differently moving forward",Asshole
AITA for ignoring my step mother in front of her boss?,"So I have been living with my step mother and dad for the past few months.

I really dislike my stepmom. She is always insulting me for things that aren't fully my fault (like being socially anxious) and she doesn't treat me like a family member.

She also refuses to use my real name, because that's her other (older) kids name too. She calls me by my middle name instead, which I absolutely hate. I told this to her a thousand times, but she just doesn't care.

Yesterday I went shopping with her for groceries. After we got out of the shop and walked over to the car, she noticed her boss a few cars away and went over there to talk. After a few minutes of me awkwardly standing by the car she shouted to me to go there and introduce myself, but she, as always, didn't use my real name. 

I decided to ignore her. I hoped that she will realize her ""mistake"" and correct herself, but she kept shouting my middle name. She gave up trying after a while and said goodbye to her boss very soon.

Needless to say, that she was extremely upset. She remained silent while she was driving home but I knew that I won't get away with this without a big argument.

When we got home she basically exploded: she was shouting at me for like twenty minutes of how I embarrassed her in front of her boss and that I'm immature and childish. My dad also took her side. He understands that I don't like being called by my middle name, but said that I should act like a grown up and know better than petty revenge.

Are they right? Was I acting childish and should I apologize?


Update: So I talked to her... She said that she didn't realize how much I hate my middle name, and that she doesn't understand why do I care so much. She also said that she's willing to call me by another name of my choosing, but not my real name, because that's her other daughter's name. I'm not saying that I'm happy with this, but it's still better than my middle name (sadly it's impossible to make normal sounding nicknames out of my real name)

I'm sorry that I can't answer everyone, but thank you so much for all the advice and support. :) I will try talking to my dad too when he gets home.

AITA for kicking out my friend which means she'll basically lose custody of her child?,"My friend is a single mother going through a fight for custody of her 5 year old son. The son stays with the father most days and the father wishes for full custody. My friend and her ex are at odds due to my friend's living situation. She can no longer afford to live in her apartment and moved into a shelter briefly which becomes a unanimous ""no"" in terms of custody battles. If you don't have a permanent residence that's like a house or apartment, you will almost always lose these cases. I outstretched an olive branch and let her live with me. She's been here two weeks. I have a house so it's no big deal for me.

Something about me: two years ago I lost my husband and daughter in an MVA. I have dozens of photos of us all as a family, and about a dozen of my daughter. My late husband was a photographer and was the one who took all of our shots, not a cellphone photo in sight. In fact, I have precisely zero photos otherwise of us.

Two days ago was the first day my friend was allowed access to her child for the day and I was at work all day. I figured they'd hang out at home while I worked. It turns out her son got at my albums and destroyed or defaced pretty much all of them. I have no clean photos of my daughter anymore, they're either ripped to shreds or have marker all over them.

My friend did nothing to stop this: this doesn't happen in the time it takes to run to the washroom or anything so I deduce it was either my friend went out for an extended period of time leaving her son home alone or she just didn't care. In either case, I was furious.

I decided to give me friend three days notice to leave. She has no tenant rights as she's been here <30 days, in fact I had to give her no time but I didn't want to toss her to the streets with nothing. She leaves tomorrow.

Was I an asshole here? Her son destroyed property of mine of extreme sentimental value. I don't know if I can get them restored and getting new prints is impossible. In the back of my mind I think of her custody battle and how I've thrown a wrench in it all but this is beyond a tiny thing. This was malicious negligence on her part.",Not the A-hole
AITA for rejecting my dad’s apology and not agreeing to donate my kidney to him?,"
My parents split up when I was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. My mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and I and stopped paying child support. He justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way I had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. About a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. However, today he asked if my sister and I could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which I had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. I rejected his request and told him I wasn’t ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and I suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. After rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said I was murdering him. Some of my friends also said I should forgive him because he is my father and that I am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. So AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for ordering a meat dish while eating with my vegan friend.,"Yesterday my friend 
/acquaintance and I went to a restaurant after work. She is a vegan and ordered a vegan dish. I ordered something that contained beef. 

When my dish came, my friend was shocked to see that it contained meat because she assumed that it didn’t (for some reason). She said she no longer felt comfortable eating at the same table as me unless I sent the food back. I said no way I was going to do that.

She said “maybe we can reschedule” and that she was sorry but she could not eat with someone who was eating meat.

I said ok maybe we can get our food packed up. We did and then she said she wasnt feeling good and had to go back to her hotel. So I just sat on a bench in the park and ate my food by myself. It was really weird. 

Should I have been more accommodating? She isn’t allergic to anything, apparently the smell of meat makes her sick? Which I just found out today. AITA.",Not the A-hole
AITA? Told GF to move out and life has gotten 10X harder for her.,"Hi

I'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

In a nutshell my GF (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/M) house last year.  The house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and F) from a previous relationship.

When she moved her and her girl in I made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

Yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- Got muck/handprints everywhere
- Broke and refused to replace things in my house
- Would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- Left mountains of clothes everywhere
- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours
- Literally drained me emotionally and financially
- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- Put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- Kept leaving the toilet a mess
- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

When I questioned her on any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.

About a month ago, a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

We are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me £165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of £600 per month for her rent alone.

I feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

AITA?  Or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


Edit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

UPDATE:  Wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

After getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided to break this off.
Like some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.

A while ago I asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX""

Some of you have said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.

UPDATE:  I wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, I'll respond.

A)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if I was lucky.

B)  She never gave BJs

C)  She INSISTED on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  Every time.  She told me ""Go down on me, or there is no sex""

D)  Never did anything else.  Vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my daughter I won’t split my investments intended for my grandson to share with his new stepsiblings because I don’t give a shit about them?,"My daughter has one son. He is 15. She had a ‘change of heart’ about being married to my grandsons father in 2018 who by all accounts is a hard working, humble man. She wanted a lifestyle change. Enter her new husband, an unemployed ‘actor’ with two children. He is irresponsible, shady, not trustworthy. I have caught him rummaging in my grandsons room in my home with no excuse as to why. There are other things too that make me distrust him. 

I have a lot of anger surrounding my daughters choice which in my opinion was motivated by selfishness- she took off and left my grandson with me and my wife while she went out of state for weeks on end throughout the past year to visit her partner, and my grandsons grades, happiness, and health have all taken an enormous knock. He has lost weight, misses his mother and father, is lonely and anxious. She doesn’t call him or care about him anymore. 

My wife and I have purchased some property with the intention of gifting it to my grandson when he turns 18. We have also gifted from our savings into a new bank account (in my wife’s name for the moment) a helpful amount that he will be able to use for college. 

The only reason my daughter is aware of this is because the purchase of the property was not something we were exactly able to keep secret. I decided to be upfront and tell her if she doesn’t want to be a mom, her own mother and I will do right by our grandson. 

My daughter has threatened to estrange herself from my wife and I because we are showing favoritism to my grandson. She came to our home yelling and screaming, and asked ‘do you even give a shit about the step kids?’ I told her those other two children aren’t my responsibility nor do I give a shit about them.

AITA for adopting a kid my friend's sister had planned to adopt?,"It's been a couple years but a post on here reminded me of it and we lost several friends over this but still feel we were in the right.

My wife and I had adopted my niece Katie when she was 3, and when she was 6 we were looking to adopt another child. My wife's friend introduced us to her sister, Jill, who was also trying to adopt.

About 2 months into being friends with Jill she found a boy she wanted to adopt, Henry, who was 7 at the time. Jill took Henry out for the day. My wife and I were taking Katie to the park so we arranged to meet them there. Henry and Katie instantly got on. Henry was a great kid but very hyper, presumably because he was excited to meet Jill. Jill commented to me that she hadn't been able to calm Henry down all morning, and asked if we could watch him for a second while she took a breather. We agreed and spent the time talking to Henry, who seemed to fit in well with our existing family dynamic. Eventually it was time for us all to leave, so we went our separate ways.

Several weeks later Jill called me to say that the adoption had been rejected by the agency. Apparently Henry himself had refused it, so the agency had to decline.

A few months after that Jill found a different child she wanted to adopt and started the process, while we were invited to an open day at a local home, where several prospective parents/families meet the kids. When we were there we saw Henry. We were using the same agency as Jill and it was coincidence or luck depending on how you look at it. Henry remembered us, we still got on great with him, and we ended up adopting him. From what Henry has said, he rejected Jill as she didn't have a lot of patience and wasn't willing to work with him, while we were a bit more flexible.

We didn't tell Jill because at this stage we'd only ever met her twice (once for coffee, and then the park) and while we'd had some contact with her over text/phone calls we didn't know how she'd take this. We also didn't tell our friend, but after adopting Henry we posted an updated family photo on social media, which a different friend shared, and that was how the first friend saw it. She told Jill that we'd adopted him, and Jill replied to our post that she'd considered us friends and we'd adopted ""her son"" out from under her. We clarified the timeline immediately but our friends were shocked at us and we received several messages saying they couldn't believe we'd done that and saying Henry should essentially be seen as off limits to us because he'd rejected Jill, some even calling us ""greedy"" because we already had my niece while Jill had no kids. We felt that was absurd and ended up blocking most of them but to this day whenever we see any of them they're still appalled that we adopted Henry and even the people who supported us joke about about us stealing other people's kids.

AITA for not responding to a Professor after he's called me the wrong name even after I've repeatedly collected him?,"I'm in a relatively small computer graphics class, about 14 people. My Professor has learned everyone's name but mine. And it's a pretty common girls name. The first few time he called me the wrong name I politely corrected him. But after the 5th or 6th time I stopped responding to him. Today during a critique he said ""samantha what's your opinion on the piece"". My name is not samantha and there's no samantha in the class. I ignored him and he called my ""name"" again. I told him that's not my name. He got annoyed and said I should have known he was talking to me because he was looking at me.

EDIT: HOLY CRAP I did not expect this big of a response. After I made the post I spoke to a few other people (girls included) in my class. Apparently this Professor is known for being very arrogant and full of himself. He acts this way all the time and it's not his way of being funny. Sadly I have him next semester because he's the only one who teaches the class I need. I'll keep you updated! Let me know if you want more stories on the semi unprofessional things he's done.
P.s thanks for the silver 😁

EDIT 2: Thank you for all the advice, as much as I'd like to be just as rude to him as he is to me I've decided to talk to him and tell him I understand he teaches more than one class but it bothers me when he call me the wrong name. Thank you for the advice",Not the A-hole
AITA I told my sister the family store is probably not getting any business bc she keeps shoving my nephew in photos of products that are irrelevant,"My sister just had a baby and he’s a couple months old, kinda in that ugly chicken phase. She has been trying for a baby for over 10 years and I’m super proud of her because I know she was hurting with infertility etc. 

She co-owns a successful business w/ my parents and it’s her job to post pictures on their website of the products.

For the sake of argument, let’s say they handmake leather goods like wallets and purses. Nothing to do with kids. She will post photos of my nephew either on the goods partially obscuring the items or with items on top of him. She jumped straight back into work and uses my nephew as props. 

Business has taken a noticeable dive and people keep emailing the store to ask if they can get clearer pictures etc. 

Recently someone left a bad review AFTER purchasing items saying ‘I came here to buy x, not look at someone’s baby’. My sister took it the wrong way and actually blacklisted the customer and also sent a strongly worded email to them saying they’re a family business and how dare they critizise her and no one knows what she’s been through. 

My parents actually had to reach out to that customer and offered to fully refund them. I gently said to my sister (I was in the room when my parents were refunding over $200 worth of leather goods) that maybe she should keep work and family separate. 

She started screaming at my that I’m a stupid kid and. I don’t know what I’m talking about (I’m 17, shes 30+, i was a total surprise baby...) and that I’m evil and dumb etc. My parents asked me to apologize to her which I don’t think I should do.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I tell my lodger she gets no say on what house I buy?,"I (36F) live in a house that I own with a lodger (34F) who has lived with me for 9 years. We've had other lodgers come and go in that time but it's just the 2 of us at the moment.

For personal reasons there are bad memories for me in the house but I haven't been able to afford to move until now.

Recently I received some money and decided I'd like to sell my current house and buy a ""forever home"" where I plan to live until I'm old. Hopefully that house will see my lodger leave and me get married again, kids etc. over the next few years.

Lodger has suggested she would like to move with me, which is great as I like having her around and the rental money is useful. But has now started making a lot of demands about features the new house ""must"" have or locations where it ""must"" be.

She's lived with me a long time and I want her to be happy in the new place but WIBTA if I chose what I want and tell her that her choice is to move with me or find somewhere else to live but I'm choosing MY forever home and not taking her wishes into account?

I'm a part time wheelchair user and expect to need to use my wheelchair more in the future so there are already quite a lot of requirements when trying to buy a suitable place for my future.

EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many responses. Thank you everyone, I've read every response so far and will try to keep up with any more.I appreciate the NTA / NAH consensus but you've raised some good points about her expectations and understanding of the situation maybe being different from mine so I'll make sure I have a calm but honest discussion with her about life goals and expectations then make a decision about whether I actually want her to make this move with me.Thank you to those who have commented with thoughtful and insightful suggestions, it helps to stop and think about how she might be feeling and what her motivations might be.

EDIT2: Lots of people are asking what a lodger is. I own the house, she pays me rent to live with me. She has her own bedroom and shares the kitchen/lounge/bathroom etc with me. We are friends and get on together pretty well, as you'd hope after living with someone nearly a decade. She is not my carer and there has never been any romantic relationship between us.

WIBTA if I don’t disclose that I’m a product of incest to my present partner or potential future partners,"I (22F) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. I received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. I connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. I still really don’t know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. However, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. I talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. I did some research, and was able to corroborate with DNA testing that he is indeed my mother’s first cousin. Obviously that was shocking, and I feel like my existence was a mistake. I’ve been struggling with it. Thankfully, from what I’ve read, there’s very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and I don’t have any medical issues. I do wear contacts, have ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Auditory Processing Disorder, and I’m prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). But none of these are major in the slightest and I live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. I’m in a relationship right now, I don’t know how long it’ll last or if it’ll last. I would love to eventually marry him but I’m 22 and I’m  being a realist here. WIBTA if I didn’t tell him since there’s virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also I’m scared that he would break up with me because of it. 

Also before anyone makes any Kentucky/Rolltide, my bio family is from Ashland, KY. My life is a meme at this point

Edit: I honestly did not think this would blow up so much. Really glad this is a throwaway. I guess some info for people.

1. My mother didn’t know she and my father were related. Growing up she never knew her mother’s side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. My parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn’t a sexually abusive situation. They went to the same high school and they didn’t look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (I think their mothers were siblings). Mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, I think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. Boyfriend and I have been together about a year, which isn’t long but I can see it leading to marriage. Also he’s not American, so no chance of us being related! Trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. Views of incest are a bit different here in America for you non Americans. Especially since I live in a very religious area, my family are strict Catholics. It’s not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

**Edit 2** This blew up like crazy and I was certainly not expecting it! I really appreciate all the kind words and reassurance!  Ive been in my own head about this and I appreciate that so many of you are willing to offer advice!",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid?,"My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

So here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

Between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

I want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

AITA for telling my husband I hate his mentally disabled brother and that I will never form a relationship with him?,"There’s a lot going on here but I’ll keep it as short as possible. My husband and I live fairly close to his parents (like 15 min) and his brother who has severe intellectual disabilities at age 36. 

My husband is a doctor and with the pandemic we’ve decided to live apart for the time being so he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally infecting me. So now I’ve moved in with my in laws and his brother. 

I love his in laws like my own parents. His brother, however, is another story. He’s disabled but he has an incredibly foul mouth and very offensive opinions that he’s formed from years surfing deep corners of the internet. 

But he’s disabled and is not all there sometimes, so I do my best to help out and keep my mouth shut. Last Saturday I was going on a walk with him (daily exercise) when we were walking past this big grocery store parking lot. We see a dad and son loading groceries into their car and my BIL started yelling racial insults at them (they were Asian). 

I was horrified and I tried pulling him away. But it was heartbreaking seeing the look on the little boy’s face and the exhausted/defeated expression on his dad’s face as they drove away. I was so angry that night I called my husband and basically told him I will rent a hotel room myself because I can’t stand another minute in the same house as his brother. 

It’s been a week and my husband has told me he can’t sleep because he’s so upset over what I told him. I admit I used harsh words and fully laid out my feelings. He said he still loves his brother and can’t stand the thought of us never getting along. AITA for telling him directly how I felt about this brother?

WIBTA If I broke up with my girlfriend over my cat's mental health?,"Throwaway because she knows my reddit account. Hear me out on this one. Please? 

&#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her Molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. Earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. I've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting Molly. Molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. About six months later in December she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. She fell in love immediately and so did I. I tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. She said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. 

&#x200B;

I still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. For one, Molly refuses to listen to him. He growls, he hisses at her. She started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. She doesn't listen to ME when I try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. She keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. I work at home, and he's a completely different cat when I'm home and she isn't.  He plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. 

&#x200B;

I've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. Every single time I bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. They're not, but she's not a good fit for him. So at this point I'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  Our relationship isn't that solid but I think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr: My girlfriend and I adopted a cat and she makes him miserable. She thinks it'd be cruel to rehome him, so I'm seriously considering breaking up with her and taking him with me. WIBTA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to babysit my nephew on my day off?,"Context. Story happened in early 2020. I (F31) have a brother (34), we're both no longer speaking to our parents. He has been with his GF for 10 years who has no sibling but is very close to her parents. Four years ago, they told me they were having a baby. Of course, I was thrilled for them.

Few months later, BOOM baby boy! (G) For reasons stated earlier, we're pretty small family, I'm his only aunt, I don't want children.

Here's the thing. While she was pregnant, B & GF kept implying stuff like how awesome it was going to be for them that I will be there for my nephew, for babysitting etc. TBH, at that point, it felt... awkward? Not at first, but they were really pushing it. Stuff like ""Don't worry babe, if we want a dinner date, we'll drop baby at auntie"" so I was very clear at the time : yes, I want a relationship with that kid, no, I won't  be a third parent. Ok to babysit, not to parent every time they feel like ""just being a couple"" in their words.

So I did that. I babysit only if I was available and with some notice. Sometimes, they have been very short (Like day before, because GP were not available, or something came up). Note that I ADORE this little boy, he is amazing and we're doing a lot of stuff together, but still. He is not my child, I don't want to have any, won't change my mind. I also have a very tiring job, with weekend and night shifts so sometimes, I really want to just be by myself at home.

Early February, B called, asked if I could have G for the day. I said no, that it was my first week-end off in months (Has been crazy at work and got promoted to manager) and I wanted it to be mine, relax, see some friends. He insisted. GF insisted. They both said ""G will be so disappointed"" but I stood my ground, I was so exhausted, I just wanted a weekend at home, not entertained a 3 years old with too much energy.

Then on the Saturday in question, at 8 am... Someone knocks. B, GF and little G. They were dropping him off because, well, I was going to stay at home and they really wanted to go out for the day in a different city. I was livid, told them the same things I already said while trying to stay calm because G was watching and listening. No, week-end off, not available, happy to see you, but goodbye. They did not want to hear anything. B told me that I was being selfish, that they told G he was spending the day with me and he was so thrilled etc, that I did not have kids so it was the least I could do etc. Stood my ground, again, told him me not having kids was in part because I knew I was not willing to sacrifice my days to kids, that I was not a third parent or at their disposal.

They left, G was upset/crying. Of course he was, he thinks I don't like him anymore for not wanting to have him, and I'm pissed for that. Friends think I should have agreed, for his sake, but I feel like they weaponized their son to make me cave and it's infuriating.

"AITA for telling my friend to remove his Mental Illness from his resume, to boost his chances of getting an interview?","A close friend of mine has bipolar disorder, and he is religiously committed to his treatment - he takes his meds on time, never misses out on any of his therapy sessions. He also has an incredibly supportive family and a wonderful, accepting girlfriend. I think he's thriving in his personal life and his diagnosis is being taken care of very well.

Anyway, he lost his job a while ago and has been applying ever since. He approached me with his resume so I could help him out because he was not scoring any interviews. At first I thought he was being hyperbolic but he actually applied to more than 95 places over a span of 2 weeks and got no calls. He has plenty of experience, excellent reviews and is more than qualified. So it was quite puzzling to me that he couldn't get any calls out of this massive exercise, but when I went through his resume I found out that he had mentioned in it that he has bipolar disorder and depression and that he is in treatment for it. That would explain his failiure rates, because of the stigma attached to mental health.

So I told him that he should consider removing it from his Resume. First of all, his mental health is his business alone. Second, he is being responsible enough by treating the condition for what it is - a health related condition. He wouldn't be writing that he has Asthma in his resume, for instance. He didn't have any objections, just that his Girlfriend told him that he should embrace his disorder and not shy away from it.

Later that night his gf texted me and politely told me that it wasn't right that I told him to remove it. It's a part of him and he shouldn't be hiding such things from potential employers. If they reject him for his diagnosis, they weren't fit to work at anyway. I put across my perspective and she just asked me to stay out of it.

So, honestly I'm not sure if what I said was correct. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for protecting my children who were technically born from an affair?,"I'm trying to keep this vague for obvious reasons. I'm in my mid-30s. I got pregnant from a one night stand. Honestly, I always wanted kids, and for various reasons, it's not likely that I'll ever have a long term partner. I've tried and had many heartbreaks. He's in the military, and pretty much ghosted me once I told him the news. It's fine, it was a one night stand anyway, hardly a love affair. 

I busied myself preparing for motherhood and welcomed twins. When they were just born, he was apparently back in town. He was shocked to see that I'd given birth, and came clean that he had a wife and she could NOT find out about this, but seemed pleased that one child was a boy (gross). I had no idea he was married, but I realized I had to act quickly. 

I promptly filed a paternity case and child support, making sure I could beat out his wife in getting an order as legally, child support is first come, first served. Whoever has the earliest date on the order wins. I knew my children would never get a dime past an order now, so I had to grab what I could for them. My kids were apparently also eligible for some military dependent benefits, which wouldn't hurt them.

Turns out, his wife has five children, all of whom would now get less in child support than my kids if she left him. My one boy is apparently the only male child, and he's apparently obsessed with that. Child support now also apparently takes a huge dent in their finances. She's a SAHM, which I figured but didn't know. She's financially trapped in her marriage now. I'm not a typical mistress and I only slept with him once and didn't know he was married, but to her I am. I'm only trying to protect my children as best I can and get them what they deserve.

AITA for choosing my dad over my mom?,"Throwaway account because my friends know my original account. I’m posting this here because I believe some of you all can understand my point of view and guide me through the right path. Thank you in advance.

My(15f) parents filed for divorce a few months ago, after my dad found out about my mom’s infidelity. This broke his heart because she was his high school sweetheart. I’ve never seen my dad cry for anything, but after finding out that my mom got pregnant with her POS new bf, he broke down crying in his room. I’m really disgusted by my mom, and I don’t want to have a relationship with her. I was always closer to my dad because my mom wouldn’t treat me well growing up. So I chose my dad and told him that I don’t want to see my mom ever again knowing she did this to us. She betrayed my dad and broke any trust we had in her. 

My mom is now mad at me for choosing my dad because I’m their only child. She wants me to be there with her by helping her with the pregnancy, but I don’t want to do anything with her, her bf or their unborn child. I’m honestly tired of her. She accused my dad of brainwashing me and flaunting his money to make me stay with him. Yes, my dad is richer than her(his family is also wealthy), but I chose him because I don’t want to leave him alone. I don’t want to betray him like my POS mom did. My aunts(mom’s sisters) are now blaming my dad and are harassing me for isolating my mom. They’re calling me an ungrateful child because my mom carried me for 9 months and I’m not choosing her. 

I can’t talk to my friends about this as they don’t understand my life(they don’t have divorced parents) and I just wanted to know if I did the right thing or not. So AITA?

Edit 1: Hello, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank every single one of y’all here. Thank you for understanding my pain, and thank you for showing me the true colour of my mom. All these while I thought she really wanted me to be there with her because she was weak during her pregnancy but reading everyone’s comment made me realise that she actually wants me as the unpaid nanny. She also wants me to be with her because she wants my dad to pay child support. I was really gullible and thought she wanted me because she loved me. I feel shitty now. I have blocked all my aunts’ numbers, and I showed my dad this thread. Like some of y’all suggested, I would definitely let my dad’s lawyer know about the harassment I was receiving. I’m not sure if I want to cut my mom off from my life entirely or not, and I know her unborn child is innocent, but I’m not ready to face any of them. I hope in the future, I’m strong enough to forgive her and be a sibling to her child. But for now, I want to be with my dad cause he needs it. I suggested therapy for both of us, and my dad agreed too. He was really thankful for everyone’s comment also. Thank you again. Thanks for the awards, 10 kind strangers. I would definitely reply to the DMS as soon as possible because I just need some time to digest everything. Thank you again. Have a great day everyone 💛",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to wear a bra while my boyfriend’s friend is staying at our apartment?,"About a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and I said yes. So the next day his friend shows up while I’m at work. When I get home I greet the friend (who I’ve never met before). I then proceed to go to the bedroom where I change out of my work clothes and throw on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. I never wear a bra at home as I find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. I then go out to the living room to join them. As I’m sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of “dude, put on a bra”. I figure he’s joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so I just brush it off. He doesn’t bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

Fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. So his friend comes over and this time I’m home when he gets dropped off.  I was not wearing a bra when he arrived. I would like to point out that I was wearing a rather baggy T-shirt so it wasn’t as if you could really see anything. That being said I do have enormous titties (I wear a size 40I bra). Immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone “I thought I asked you last time to please wear a bra!!”  I’m taken aback and I don’t really know what to say. I kind of stammer our a “what,why?” 

Him: I feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
Me: But you can’t actually see my boobs 
Him: Are you kidding me? They’re huge! Of course I can see them! 
Me: Dude, I’m wearing a baggy shirt. At most you can see a bit of an outline. I don’t understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
Him: you’re joking right??
Me: No...? 
Him: fucking unbelievable

I look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. So I excuse myself to the bedroom. A little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if I’m ok. I tell him I’m fine, just a bit taken aback. He asks if I wanna come play video games with them in the living room and I agree. Before we’re out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe I should put on a bra.  I had explained to him before how I felt about bras. He said he understood but didn’t want to make his friend uncomfortable. I was annoyed and told him I would just stay in the bedroom. So for the rest of his friend’s stay I stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

So finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. Then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. He tells me I should’ve just sucked it up and put on a bra and that I was kind of being an asshole about it. I feel like I should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also I wonder if I should’ve been more accommodating to a guest that’s very important to my bf.

AITA for making a dark joke at my SO’s expense,"Some context:

I’m extremely pregnant (like waddling Danny-DeVito-as-The-Penguin pregnant) and fighting a chest cold, back pain, bruised rib, overall fatigue, and a womb resident that won’t quit moving (which is a good thing, but can be painful!). I work from home, which makes it easier. 

My boyfriend has an abscess that requires a root canal. YIKES. I’ve never had a root canal, but tooth/mouth pain is no joke. He works in a field where he’s on his feet for sometimes 12+ hours a day. 

The setup:

Yesterday, he came home early after the dentist. Knowing that he’s been tired and feeling bad, last night I got him set up in bed, made him dinner (twice), picked up his antibiotics, brought him ice cream and tea, and overall just made sure he had everything he needed. I even slept in the other room, as I tend to get up a lot because pregnancy is uncomfortable and I didn’t want to bug him. Truly, I’m happy to do it. 

This morning, I woke up to a text from him that just said, “I need water.”

*I need water.*

I was annoyed, because even though he’s not feeling well, a tooth abscess doesn’t take away your ability to walk. I brought it to him anyway, and he made a big deal about lifting himself up to drink from the cup and take two ibuprofen. No “thank you.” Just put his head back down and closed his eyes. 

Pain is pain—I get it. I don’t have a monopoly on discomfort just because pregnancy can sometimes really blow. It’s not a competition. But it is kind of cringe-y to demand your pregnant girlfriend, who already has some mobility issues and near-constant pain, to grab you something you could easily get yourself. 

The AITA dilemma:

Trying to be lighthearted about the audacity of that text request, I drew a picture on his breakfast cup (something I do every day when I make his breakfast) of a tombstone with the words “I need water” on it, surrounded by flowers and with his birth year - 2019 on it. 

He was...not happy. Like, actually mad that I did that. He said my humor “is not normal,” and that it’s not at all funny. He left in a huff and without saying goodbye. 

So, AITA for the joke? Or am I missing the real issue entirely?

*ETA: We both apologized for not being considerate of the other person, and it’s all ok. He’s a good dude, just off his game today. Still doesn’t think I’m as funny as I think I am, though—lol.*",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking my little brother out for not shoveling the walk way and side walk?,"My little brother (26M) lives with my wife and I (30f/30M), he used to live his GF, but since breaking up, he couldn't afford his own place so has been living with us since July, rent free.

My wife is due with our first child any day now (Her due date is Jan 2) and I have been working long hours at my job. The company I work for is doing a merge, and I have been putting in longer hours to try and get things done so that when my wife has our baby, I won't constantly be pulled away or called while trying to support her and our son.

My little brother works a trade that usually has next to no work during the winter (he does roofing and siding for his friends dad, and we live in Canada) so lately, he's just been sitting at home playing on his computer or going out with friends.

It's been snowing here pretty heavy the last 3 days, and now that its finally lightened up, we can  do the sidewalks. I called my wife on my break and she mentioned that some of the kids that come by have a hard time getting through the snow (we live by a school and on a corner lot, so we are responsible for shoveling the side as well) 
I told her to get my brother to shovel the walks, she said she asked him, but he told her he was  going out, (this was at about noon).

 I texted my brother and asked what time he would be home, he said around 2, so I asked him to shovel the walks when he got back, he asked when the last time I shoveled them. I got annoyed and told him again to please shovel the walks as I wouldn't be home till around 8, he didn't respond.

I got home and saw they were done, when I went inside, my wife was laying down and holding her stomach (just some Braxton Hicks she said) I asked her if she was okay, and she said yes, just exhausted from shoveling. I was furious. I asked her why my brother didn't do it, and she said he refused as he is not the home owner. 

I went into our basement and lost my shit at him, reminding him that he lived rent free in my house and ate my food. He told me I was over reacting, that it was just snow, and that him living there didn't mean he was obligated to do ""my chores"". I  told him to get out. He left and about a hour later I got a call from my mom yelling at me to call my brother and apologies, that he has no where else to go, and how I shouldn't be acting like this a few weeks before Christmas. I told her he needed to apologize to my wife and I, and that if he wanted to come back, he needs to be contributing going forward. 

He ended up staying at a friend's last night, and I have yet to hear from him, AITA here?

Edit: just wanted to add, my brother's response to  my wife shoveling was that she made that choice to do that, as he told her to wait for me. I've also had a coworker tell me it was a huge over reaction on my end, and that while my brother should apologize, I should as well.

Edit: thanks everyone for the responses, just to answer a few questions though: 

My wife told me it wasn't that big of a deal that she ended up doing it (she still shouldn't of had to though) and in our city, we usually have about 24 hours to clear the snow until a bylaw officer comes around, so I'm surprised they weren't around sooner (I'm assuming it was due to the amount of snow we were getting for 3 days straight) so that, plus my wife watching kids struggle, plus us being liable for any injury was her reasoning for doing it.

So yes I was mad that my very pregnant wife ended up doing it, but also his complete lack of respect to her and myself, asking me when I had done it last, saying it was a home owners job......

And as for my mom, her and my dad live in one of those 55+ retirement communities out in a county about 90 Min away, I guess he could stay with them for a bit, but I think it has to be okayed with the condo committee (I'm not sure how that works) 

I have also yet to hear back from my brother in regards to my stipulations about him coming back.

Edit: sorry, one more thing since I see it coming up alot. In my Province and I believe most of Canada, the Residential Tenancies Act doesn't apply to family members living with landlords, he is in no way legally considered a tenant in my home, so unless his name is on the deed to my house,  we can have him come and go as we so choose.

AITA for objecting to 'girls day'?,"I'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


About 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


When I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


I griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

At this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example.

WIBTA for having my cousin arrested?,"Backstory:
A few months ago (pre-COVID) my cousin, who I am close to, had a big co-ed baby shower thrown for her. I was in attendance, along with my husband. Another cousin was visiting her parents, my aunt and uncle, and decided to attend the baby shower as well. I’m not close to this cousin at all. We didn’t grow up together and are 10 years apart in age. 
We are obligatory Facebook friends though, mostly due to my aunt and mother asking us both to add each other.


Skip ahead to present day:
A few days ago I got a call from a bank I have a credit card through, inquiring about my balance not being paid, as I have always paid my outstanding bills on time. I told the bank employee I had not used my card, so that charge was fraud. The card account was immediately closed, and they began the process of looking further into it. Today they called me back with an update. The charge was for a donation to a charity that I knew of but have never contributed to myself. Still confused about why my card was used, I posted a short rant on FB. I got a few replies telling me this had never happened to them, and hoping I got it all resolved soon. Then my younger non-pregnant cousin commented something to the effect of  “Well, maybe someone had a good reason for making the donation in your name. Maybe someone wanted to teach you a lesson.” The comment was weird, so I PM’ed her to ask what she meant. At first she wouldn’t tell me what she meant, but eventually I got her to tell me everything. 

She used my CC to make a donation. 

Her reason? Because about a year ago I began going to church. I didn’t grow up in a religious family. I’m not vocal about my newfound beliefs. I don’t throw it in people’s faces or demand they believe the same. It’s just something that I like for my own life. It makes me feel better and more relaxed. Apparently my cousin has a problem with me deciding to attend and join a church of any kind. And because of that she decided it was a good idea to sneak around and take photos of my credit card. And then use the info to make a $1000 donation to a local organization she knew I would never donate to because they’re very outspoken about opposing what I believe morally. My husband says I should press charges and have her arrested. My mom says that’s going too far, even though my cousin was in the wrong, because she’s only 19. 

So WIBTA for pressing charges on my cousin and possibly ruining her life?

Edit: the organization is not anti-gay or anything like that. It’s not PP either. FYI, I’m a gay male who is pro-choice so stop assuming I’m some kind of intolerant lunatic. 

Edit 2: It seems I’m not allowed to post an update separately. 
The bank is proceeding with legal action. She’s being held accountable by them. I’m still undecided about what I want to do personally. She was arrested, charged, then released with an ankle monitor due to overcrowding and it being a non-violent offense. So she can go to her part time job, the grocery, and home until her trial. After that, I don’t know what will happen. The bank is definitely suing her. The detective assigned to the case is in the process of finding out if anyone else has been a victim of her thievery. As of right now things are slowly going forward, but I don’t know when the actual trial will be. It might be awhile.",Not the A-hole
AITA for becoming hysterical at a school secretary's expense?,"Throwaway- Im just going to get in to it.

I (19M) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, I was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

I ran in to the the office which was really crowded. There was only one secretary, and I knew instantly who it was- My mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

I ran in but there was a line up, I told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if I was blind ""there's a line hun"".

I waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

I got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""Ready to talk to me"" I was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. I was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation I was in.

I dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. The secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

She started by telling me ""See hun, I told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, A student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, I could have handled this situation a lot better- I have a lot of students to deal with""

I looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? Every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? Were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

I yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""The school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

Are you serious? How am I supposed to react in that situation? Yes, I agree I was really angry, but I feel like I was justified- My sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- I would have waited if I heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. AITA?

EDIT- 

To add context, some people are confused as to why I didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) I don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, I guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not helping my coworker move after I showed up and no one was ready for the move and they started to belittle me over my life choices.,"This happened this morning.  I agreed to help a work buddy to move since I had a large truck and a trailer that I could use.  The plan was simple, I would show up around 6:30-6:45 AM.  And we would start with the large stuff (couch, beds, ect) and file any open space left with the packing boxes.  So well not everything had to be packed and ready to go (They were still living in the house so you need access to some stuff) I told them to have at least 70-80% of it ready and the his wife and kids can pack the rest for when we were traveling to the new place about 50 minutes away. He agreed to pay for the gas, breakfast, and lunch, I agreed to be the driver and mover. 

Well I show up at 6:38 on and give them a call. No pickup.  So I go up to the room which is on the 3rd floor, knock on the door and no answer.  So I try the phone again, and after checking that I have the right address (I don't want to wake the wrong person up) I try the door again.  One of the kids opens up and I am relived to that I have the right place.  I enter and find that a small pile of boxes on the wall, and a large amount of junk just tossed around the room. I ask to make sure that everything is packed. I get some attitude from her about how she has kids and I don't, so I need to shut up about it. Buddy shows up, and joins her, and I get about a dozen or so bingos about my life choices and how I need to help them out more since they have kids and I don't, and I can start with buying everyone breakfast and helping pack the boxes.  After about 20 minutes of this, I just left and went home. I have about 100 missed calls and texts right now from them, and have no real motivation to return and help them out.

Edit:  I started to read though the texts after cooling off a bit and reading your replies.  I have gotten half apologies, blaming a hangover, and that they were joking about breakfast, and asking what are they going to do without my help? So far I have not responded, but I think my only response should be is ""Rent a truck""

Edit 2:  Thank you every one, this is going to be my last response for the day (did I mention I got up at 4 am to get everything ready and to leave at 6am to be there on time?) So I am going to get ready for bed soon.   A few updates

-I did call my/his supervisor and gave him a dry rundown on what happened, that they were not ready to move, and to ask if they needed me to come in for the day since I was only 5 minutes away, I texted the other 2 managers to make sure as well, I am a jack of all trades guy and can cover for everyone, but if they think I am busy with Buddy's move they won't call me, and I am always happy for some overtime cash when I am already in the area.  I picked up some Hardees and went home and killed some digital ninjas with the all clear response. 

-It seems that they are using the kids phones to text and harasser me as well (I think they are the kids numbers, since they are not in my caller ID all I see is the phone number and provider), I have muted all the conversations, but I am keeping a record of them. 

-Buddy was given a 3 day weekend just for this move, so I will not know more until Tuesday. I am actually covering his shift for this on Monday. (normally I only work 4x 12-16 hour days a week)

______________________
**UPDATE**
I'm Back, way later than I wanted to be, but I have a some updates, and a few clarifications

-Tuesday came and past, I did get an apology and Buddy asked if I could help them again, my answer was nope, and I continued to work 16 hour days for the rest of the week.

-Buddy's wife decided to go the facebook route, it did not work in her favor, she deleted the post, the whole office knows now. 

They were supposed to be out by Friday, I have been working non-stop since then today was a half day (as I only worked 9 hours today) Next Monday will be my first day off this week.  As far as I know, no one in the office will help them.  They had to rent a truck, and I got a text message, asking me to please help them on Thursday, I did not respond. 

My favors to my co-workers almost always involve me getting paid more, as it is mostly me covering shifts. I am supposed to only work 4 days a week, but lately it has been way more. Most of management is on my side, and they do not give me any grief over my decisions. 

What is a ""BINGO""  Basically when someone complains on how you live your life.  It can be a bunch of different things, but in my case, mainly because I am gay and childfree. 

**Reasons why I though I maybe the ass hole**

-I was just raised that if you agree to do something, you follow though no matter what. 

-The 20 minutes of belittling, may have been closer to 7, I was in the apartment for only about 15 minutes before I left and I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get the door to open.

-When I did leave, I did say I was going to get breakfast, I did not saw I was only getting it for myself.

AITA for not letting my MIL attend my SIL's wedding unless she changed her dress first?,"(This happened a while ago, no big weddings during a pandemic for me, dw!) 

I (24F) was the maid of honour at the wedding of my brother and his wife (my sister in law). 

While we were planning the wedding, my SIL mentioned how overbearing her mom can be, and how she always feels bad asking her to stop being an attention hog. I told my SIL that on the wedding day, I'd take care of her, no matter what. 

Sure enough, MIL pulls up to the wedding wearing a WHITE dress (something my SIL guessed she'd do). I saw her get out of her car and start walking towards the venue, so I pulled her aside before anyone could see her and brought her in through a side entrance.

I told her that it was inappropriate to wear white at someone else's wedding, and that if she wanted to attend, she'd have to change. I had my SIL give me some of MIL's nice dresses, so I had a few for her to chose from. 

MIL flipped out on me. She told me I had no right to ask her to change and that I was being a pain in the ass on an emotional day. She started crying and went to look for her husband, so I updated SIL & she told me if MIL would rather miss her own daughter's wedding rather than just change her dress, she could miss it. 

MIL ended up changing, but made a HUGE deal out of it and went home early during the reception because she ""didn't feel welcome"". She still maintains that I was out of line. I don't think I did anything wrong, but I do feel really shitty for potentially being the reason my SIL wasn't able to enjoy her wedding fully with her mother (even though SIL still had crazy amounts of fun).

AITA for tricking my roommate into eating mozzarella using a Korean hotdog because I suspected him of eating my food?,"
I recently moved back into an apartment I shared with 3 roommates for college. I lived with them last year, and one of my roommates always stole my fucking food. His (fake) name is Tyler. 

Let me explain our food setup, we have one main fridge in the kitchen that we’ve quartered off, so each person gets an equal share of the fridge space including the freezer. It’s literally partitioned with like colored tape and dividers when applicable, so there’s no way you mistake someone else’s food for yours. We do this with the pantry too. But we do share, but only when asked. 

Anyways, last year, someone kept stealing my snacks/microwaveable foods. I suspected Tyler for many reasons, but I never got enough evidence to get him to outright admit. So I decided to do a little test, that was completely harmless unless he was the thief. 

A note about Tyler is that he absolutely hates mozzarella. It’s like a weirdly intense hate. Apparently he ate a ton of mozzarella sticks on a field trip as a kid and he got food poisoning, something like that. Bad history with mozzarella basically. 

So I bought these Korean hotdogs I saw on social media, it’s like a normal hotdog, but the upper half is mozzarella, and the bottom half is just like a normal hotdog sausage. Then I microwaved one for lunch the other day, ate the entire upper mozzarella half, and waited for Tyler to walk into the kitchen. I showed him the hotdog (now with only the sausage part visible) and talked at length about how delicious these new hotdogs I bought were. 

Another thing to note is that I threw away the box the hotdogs came in, which I do for all my frozen foods for space purposes anyways. That’s where it very visibly says it has a mozzarella half. The hotdogs were individually wrapped, with the ingredients printed on there in super fine print, so it was hard to see, but if he could’ve read the ingredients and seen the mozzarella. 

Later on around 2 am, I hear Tyler literally yelp from his room, so I run in, and behold he took a big fat bite of my hotdog. It was so funny, he tried to scream at me, but because the cheese was in his mouth it came out like “Motherella!!!”. He actually ended up puking onto his bed though, so I did end up feeling semi-bad for that. 

It was a loud incident, so my other two roommates woke up and witnessed the aftermath. We did tease him about it, like when he was panicking about cleaning the bed, we joked “O’ Motherella, just get your Fairy Goudamother to clean it for you.” I thought that was pretty funny, even though it was kinda cheesy. He did not. 

Anyways, Tyler is obviously flaming furious. He thinks it’s “my fault he puked” and that I “lied about my fake hotdogs to trap him into eating mozzarella”. I argue that I never said the hotdogs did NOT contain mozzarella, I just never mentioned they did and I didn’t make him eat it. He thinks I’m an asshole who should buy him new bedsheets, I think he’s an asshole for stealing my food.",Not the A-hole
AITA for embarrassing a friend on his date because he didn’t pay back the money he owed me?,"So I lent a friend of mine £500. He needed it to see him through til the end of the month and promised to repay me on payday. 
Not a problem, I trusted the guy and knew he was good for it. 

Payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. I sent him a message about it. He said “oh yeah, sorry I forgot, I’ll do that now” 

Two weeks pass and still nothing. I message him again. He said he’d send me the money. Still nothing. He was then avoiding me so I wasn’t able to see him face to face. 

I messaged him again and he didn’t reply.

7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. I’ve not been able to get hold of him, nor have I seen him. 

This weekend just gone, I was out at a restaurant and I happened to see him as I was being seated at my table. He was on what looked like a date. 

Now at this point I could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. It’s worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. So I decided I’d go and say hello. 

I pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how I am etc. 

I then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. He looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so I tried something from one of the other plates. At this point his date (I’d learnt that this was their second date) said to me, “excuse me, but this is our food. What do you think you’re doing?” 

I looked at her and said “Well since I’m pretty much funding this meal, I figured I may as well sample what my money is getting.” 

I then said to my friend, “it was nice to see you, I’ll leave you to it. We can catch up another day.”

I then left to go back to my table. The people I were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. Some were in favour of what I’d done, others not so much.

WIBTA if I don't attend my sister's $2800 per ticket destination wedding? *I do have enough money.,"My sister is having a Destination wedding in the Dominican Republic (all-inclusive).  It'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
My sister would be very upset if I don't attend.  My parents say I should go, and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going.  

My sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   I don't make a ton of money, but I have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  While I really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. And less importantly, I have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as I don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  In my defence, I've worked hard for my money and I sacrificed quite a lot to be where I am financially.  And while I have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because I earn a big salary. But, because I work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  The cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  It would also require me using a full week of what little time I get off work.

 I really don't know if I'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if I'm being reasonable.   Last night I almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, I couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  So what do you guys think?  AITA not wanting to attend?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being angry my brother lent his girlfriend my makeup?,"I (21F) love makeup, and buy makeup that lasts longer and is of higher quality, but also thus more expensive. It's worth it to me, however, and I save money from my paycheques every month to go towards these purchases. I probably spend $80-100 a month on makeup.

When I got home from last night, my brother (28M) had his girlfriend over and they were watching a movie. I said hello and went on to do my own thing the rest of the night.

The next morning, when I went to put my makeup on, I couldn't find either of my mascaras, my eyeshadow palette or my red lipstick. I didn't start to panic yet, as I thought it could've been me or my mom who just moved something temporarily. My brother got up from bed during my search, however, and when he asked what I was looking for, I told him. He said 'Oh I lent that stuff to Kara. We're going out to a fancy dinner tonight and she doesn't have a lot of nice makeup.""

I WAS PISSED. I asked him what gave him the right to lend MY makeup to his girlfriend without my permission. He told me to chill out because he'd get it back from her tonight anyways. I told him that wasn't the point - it was MY stuff and he should've asked before just giving it to his girlfriend. I told him I didn't want her using my makeup because that's totally unsanitary. He got angry because I've let ""Olivia borrow my mascara before"" - Olivia is our sister, so to me sharing makeup with your sister (who reciprocates the favour) is a TOTALLY different story, and I wouldn't let her borrow my lipstick.

He isn't talking to me yet and is refusing to get my makeup back from his girlfriend until after their dinner tonight. I don't want to use makeup after his girlfriend I don't know does.

He had asked me what I  wanted, all of it was reasonable (fuzzy socks, a pair of slippers, ext.) I got him a special gift he has always wanted, I saved $ for 6 months to get it. Plus, shoes, clothes, tools & stuff I know he'd like. He went shopping on 12/23 at 7 pm, alone. He gave me the kids stuff to wrap. Xmas comes, my stuff wasn't wrapped, it was still in the store bag.I got a lotion set for a teen girl, a vest 3 sizes too big, and 2 identical purses in different colors, 1had a busted zipper, they smell like plastic and not something I'd buy. It looked like he walked into the store, last minute, and grabbed whatever was in the 'return to shelf' cart. I said thank you and told him I love him. I didnt get upset until Saturday. He was going to his aunt's b-day party, I stayed home (w the flu) but I asked what he got her... he goes to the car and got a huge beautiful gift bag. Inside, was a designer purse. I lost it. Not bc it was nicer than what I got but because he really put thought into it. It was her fav color and designer... When I asked why he put so much effort into her gift but not mine, he said 'omg, I spent hundreds of dollars on you' That's not true, he left the receipt in the bag w the purses. Price isnt important to me (so why lie?). I have purses that were $5 that I absolutely love. We got in an argument and he left w/out his aunt's gift. I took my gifts and the 1 for her and put them in his closet. I dont want them. The next day, he said I could have the designer purse, then got mad bc I didnt want it. I wanted a gift that he put a bit of effort into. He admitted he didnt think I'd like the purses and that he was in a hurry. After 22 years, he knows that a hand written letter or a new clock (I collect them) would have been cherished forever. He says I'm mad about the money but I think it's about effort. He gave me the impression that he dont think I'm worth either.",Not the A-hole
"AITA For being upset with my wife for going out clubbing with her girlfriends, but she leaves her ring at home so she can get “free drinks”?","Wife has been going out clubbing with friends every Friday night for awhile now. Just recently saw that she left her ring at home tonight. I texted her telling she left it at home tonight, and she responded telling me it’s so she can get free drinks from guys.

AITA for deciding not to go to my sister's wedding?,"Backstory: I (30M) am the eldest of three siblings. I have a younger sister (27F) and a younger brother (19M). Last year, my brother came out as gay. He told me that he had been struggling with his sexuality since he was 12 and that he finally had the courage to tell me. I'm really happy for him and I'm glad that he told me. However, we knew it would be hard to tell our conservative parents.

My brother eventually told our parents. Within 10 seconds, our parents flipped the table. They called him a fa\*\*ot and told him that they never wanted to see him again (they disowned him). My brother has been living with me and my wife ever since.

My sister announced her engagement 6 months ago and the wedding is in September. She started sending wedding invites a few days ago. Everything was fine, except for one thing: She didn't invite my brother

I confronted her about it and asked her why she didn't invite our brother. Her response was: ""I don't want people to find out I have a brother that is gay and mentally fucked up."" I was shocked to hear that. I know that she dislikes our brother (for taking her place as the youngest), but saying this is way out of line. My sister also said that our parents won't pay for her wedding dress if she invited him. That's when I snapped. I told her that I won't go to her wedding and that she should be ashamed of herself. She then starts crying and begging me to come to her wedding but I didn't change my mind.

I know I shouldn't have snapped at her, but I just can't believe the way she treats our brother. I'm so disappointed in her.

AITA?

Edit: I should also mention that my brother is adopted, but that doesn't change anything. He's my brother no matter what and I will always be there for him.  ",Not the A-hole
AITA for Introducing my GF as a Model?,"So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said ""Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.

\*\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.

I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Edit

At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.

&#x200B;

First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.

&#x200B;

After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200B;

What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).

&#x200B;

The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200B;

I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.

&#x200B;

I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200B;

First off its not as glamours as I thought it was

&#x200B;

She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200B;

She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a ""Model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200B;

She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200B;

This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200B;

Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",Asshole
AITA My BIL got married on my 5 yr anniversary and now SIL is mad at me about a picture,"I’ve been married 5 years.  My anniversary was back in November. My BIL (SO’s brother) met his now wife a couple of years ago, got engaged and started planning the wedding.  One night at a family dinner, they announce that they set a date...November 9th, my 5 year wedding anniversary.  I was a extremely perturbed but didn’t want to ruin their moment, so I stewed silently.  Thankfully, my MIL spoke up and said “That’s X and Y’s anniversary.  Wouldn’t you want to pick another date so that you don’t always have to share the day with them”?

Nope!  It’s the date that they want, the venue is available so it’s the date that it’ll be.  Didn’t want to hear any more about it so we dropped it.  (Come to find out that the venue had availability 2 weeks before but whatever).  I was upset for a while but life is too short to hold grudges so finally I got over it.  

The day of the wedding arrives and everything goes off without a hitch.  SO and I are both in the wedding party.  During the reception, one of our cousins went up to the DJ, requested to play our wedding song, and asked to make a small announcement wishing us a happy 5 yr anniversary.  He does and we get up and dance.  Probably 30 seconds into the song, I wave everyone in to come join us and people do.  After the song, a few family members came up to us to give us hugs, etc.  That was that. The rest of the reception was fun and everyone had a great time.

The days following the wedding, people texted me their pictures of SO and I dancing.  There was one in particular that came out really nice so I posted it on FB.  No tags whatsoever.  All my post said was “Dancing with my love”.   You can tell we’re at a wedding but you can’t see the bride or groom or anything (I made sure of this).  

I get a phone call from SO a couple of hours later telling me that his brother called him and said that his wife was hysterically crying because I posted the picture without her permission and now the element of surprise is gone when she finally shows people the professional pics.  She demanded I take it down.  I refused.  It’s a beautiful picture of us and I have a right to share it.  The only surprise that’s shown is the top of my bridesmaids dress.  Plus, there were over 250 people at the wedding.  I can’t be the only one that posted a pic.

She hasn’t spoken to me since.  And I’m okay with that.  We were never close...just cordial to each other when we’re at the in laws. The holidays were definitely awkward but we got through it.  And then COVID hit so we haven’t been together as a family in months.  To this day, she’s still mad at me.  IDK...I think she got upset when the announcement was made about our anniversary and subsequent dance.  But I never expressed my anger about her getting married on my anniversary.  

AITA for not not taking down the pic?

WIBTA if I buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?,"I guess it goes without saying that I am proposing, but I should mention my girlfriend doesn't know I will be. I picked out a ring I think she'll like. She never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. So I found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. She loves green and gold jewellery, and I spent a long time finding this one. It's a created emerald which I think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

The ring is cheap. It was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. I mentioned this to my sister who said I was a dick, essentially. Apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. She says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. I'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

I could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. I certainly wouldn't know why I'm paying more, I don't think she would either. However, I am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new TV for £250. I kind of realised I'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and I started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. So WIBTA?

Edit: I just want to clarify that we have talked about marriage and are both on board. It's the proposal in terms of when and how I do it that would be a surprise.

AITA for holding the health and safety of my dogs over the comfort of my cousin and her family?,"Earlier today, my (distant) cousin told me that she/husband/three kids were coming to visit. She asks if they can all stay in our house since we have the space and since they want to avoid paying for a hotel for two weeks. I reminded her that we have two dogs. (Golden Retrievers... who shed... a lot... and she/kids are very allergic...) I'll point out that I did not at any time say that she and her family could stay to begin with; I simply avoided by bringing up our dogs.

She then tells me I need to leave them outside or board them. I told her that we are neither putting them outside where it's far too hot to leave the dogs right now nor boarding them up in doggy daycare for two weeks (especially since my 13 year old is diabetic, needs regular blood glucose testing and insulin, and has a set routine to manage her diabetes). Plus, aside from the dogs, her husband is a bit (okay... a lot) of a homophobe, and I am not going to have him spewing bile to me and my fiancé in our own home for two weeks (but I didn't tell her any of this).

She responds by telling me that I should put my older dog to sleep because she's already old and because she has diabetes. She then says I would only need to put one dog in doggy daycare if I did that. She then asks me if my dogs are more important to me than her and her family.

I flatly told her that they were. I also told her that after her comments and her husband's pre-existing behavior there isn't any possible manner in which I hold her and her family in higher regard than my fiancé and what are basically my (furry) babies. I advised her that she is not welcome to call on us at our home, that I decline any invitation to get together at any time, and (sarcastically) encouraged her to have a wonderful vacation.

AITA for selling my late husband's restaurant against his wishes?,"I was married to my husband for 13 years, we got married at 19 and my husband passed away a few months ago. We didn't have children together. 

I have a high paying job as an attorney and I'm currently moving to another state to start my own firm. 

My husband passed away 4 months ago. It wasn't a pretty end to our marriage as I had just found out that he was cheating on me with one of the waitresses working for his restaurant. They had been having an affair which went on for 3 years. He told me he didn't love me anymore and left to be with her. He passed away due to a sudden cardiac arrest after 2 weeks of leaving our marital home. We weren't legally separated. It wasn't official. 

As his wife, I inherited everything, including the restaurant as he started the restaurant after we got married. My parents helped him financially and I supported him after I got my first job. 

After finding out about his infidelity, I had no interest in keeping the restaurant. It was doing really well, but I needed a fresh start. 

My husband was emotionally attached to his restaurant and wanted his kids to take over after he died. He wanted it to be  a family enterprise. 

I didn't want any part of that. I made the decision to move to another state for better prospects, and decided to sell the restaurant. 

2 days before I made my final move to sell it, his mistress showed up to my home begging me to not sell the restaurant because she was pregnant. She wanted her unborn child to take over the restaurant. She said that the child was morally entitled to the restaurant as his unborn child. 

I simply asked her to leave and went ahead with my decision.

AITA for having fun in front of miserable people?,"My husband and I rent a house with his brother and wife. We live in a very expensive city and this is quite a big house with great metro access, so that's what's convenient. We get along fine usually.


My husband and I have a son. He's just turned five. The early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! During this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. There were quite some bad days, but my husband and I got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. Whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


Recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. Sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. So a few days ago, I pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. When we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. It seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. I sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.Then my son and I leave for the movie.


Today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that I didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break.

Aita for telling my daughter the truth about being pregnant/giving birth?,"So I’m a mom of three kids. My oldest kid is my daughter, 23, and she’s four months pregnant right now with her first baby. She and her boyfriend are really excited to be parents and are preparing way ahead of time. They’ve made a birth plan, they’re buying baby clothes, in talks with a doula and midwife, etcetera.

She’s the first of any of her friends to have kids, so she’s been coming to me for advice. Recently we sat down for a mother-daughter lunch and were were talking about her birth plan. She asked my opinion on it.

I pretty frankly told her my honest truth; she was being unrealistic with her expectations. My first pregnancy didn’t go as planned (she was breech, which ended in an emergency c-section). With my last two I wanted a home birth, but with a VBAC that’s risky and I was advised against it. None of my pregnancies were comfortable (all my kids liked to kick the crap out of my insides, and I had gestational diabetes with my last).

So my daughter asked me to elaborate more. And I told her. About the tearing, the episio, pissing yourself, hair falling out postpartum, how much breastfeeding can hurt. I didn’t sugar coat. I went into pregnancy blind and had a rude awakening when I started having kids.

She got visibly nervous during our talk. I assured her none of it was unbearable; I got my kids out of it after all. But it wasn’t an amazing experience and “forgetting about the pain” wasn’t accurate in my experiences. I told her she needed to be ready. 

She asked if I was trying to scare her off a home/natural birth and I’m not... I just wanted to let her know things don’t always go as planned. We didn’t fight, but she got huffy and started saying I wasn’t helping, she just wanted some advice not scare tactics.

AITA - my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch,"On Thursday evenings my daughter (9F) goes to dance class with her friend Anna (9F). My wife told me to pick my daughter and Anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

I pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. My daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and I ask Anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. We all order and start eating, when suddenly Anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. I ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and I look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

I rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. I felt horrible. I call my wife when Anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and I do not have Anna's mother's phone number. So after Anna is given the all clear I immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

Her mother is furious, saying that I could have killed her child. I said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would I assume something like that. She responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. She also said that she didn't know I would be getting them dinner (School ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so I thought it would be safe to assume I would be giving them food..) I apologized for what happened, but still feel like Anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also Anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

AITA for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen?,"My (25M) girlfriend (23F) has always talked about how it’s her dream to move to X country. She brought it up on our first date (we’ve been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

At the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I’m an expat and she’s a local), etc etc 

Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I’ll bring up her spending habits. In the time we’ve been together, she’s spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she’d need to save to get started. 

After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it’s never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

She’s called me TA, that I’m trying to control her money, I’m trying to humiliate her, make her feel “small” and it’s none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

AITA for not trading seats on a plane?,"This happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought I was a bit rude, but I thought I was completely justified.


So we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


When we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he’s very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" I answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""

It didn’t really make a huge difference in my budget vs his to split rent 50/50 for 2600 a month rent.

However, things have changed. I got pregnant a few months after we go married (which we were so happy about and wanted). I didn’t want to not work, but I wanted to be home with our baby, so I found a full time remote job in my field of work. The downside is I took a cut to my salary from 65k to 50k. We continued to split rent in our apartment.

My husband, between being 26 and 30, has received a number of raises and has switched his job. He is now a senior business analyst, making roughly 195k a year. Since we were having a child, we were going to need a bigger apartment. We found a 3 bedroom for 4000k per month. He still wanted to split rent evenly, despite my protests, and despite me wanted to try to find a smaller apartment for less. In the end, I sort of let myself get walked over because he really is such a smooth talker and I do love him.

Anyway, flash forward 2.5 years, our rent has increased to 4400k. My take home pay monthly after taxes is roughly 3600k. I am paying 2.2k monthly in rent. I am also taking care of our baby and our home, doing chores, and cooking daily. My husband works from 8 - 6, but typically doesn’t get home until 7. I am burnt out. I barely have enough money per month to do things I enjoy. I feel like I am financially struggling while my husband is living a life of luxury. Yes he does take me out on dates and on vacation, but he doesn’t seem to understand that this is not enough for me.

I spoke to him two days ago very seriously, and when I asked about trying to split rent based on our income and pay an equal percentage of our income so that it is more fair than fully equal. His reaction stunned me. He asked me why having 1.6k extra a month wasn’t enough for me. I told him I’m not saving anything. He told me I should spend less on extracurricular activities - which makes me laugh because what extracurricular activities? All I do is work, cook, clean, shop for the house and raise our child. I told him I am basically working two full time jobs at once and I need help. Then he asked me if I am suggesting he pay me for being a mother and that stunned me - I really had no response to that.

Anyway, he told me that this is the lifestyle we agreed when we moved in together way back when. However, he doesn’t seem to understand, or rather does not want to understand.

Now he is mad with me because he thinks I am being selfish and has been acting cold to me these past few days. I am getting the itch to apologize and take it back like I always do, but I really feel I am right here.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Thank you all for all of the responses. I can honestly say I did not expect to get this feedback. 

I am honestly overwhelmed and cannot reply to all of you, especially while I am working but I wanted to update some things here.

I love my husband with all my heart, and it is heartbreaking for me to read these comments and realize that I am being taken advantage of. I need to figure out the best way to approach this issue and solve it before it gets too far. I want to work this out and the fear of being alone is haunting me.

Yes I did sign a prenup that was overseen by his family attorney. My husband comes from extreme wealth and I was young and stupid and went with it. Head over heels like my mother always said I was.

As for his family - we get along great and they love me. It’s very confusing because they are such incredibly generous people, and they are family. But they don’t know about our financial situation because my husband and I believe that our marriage is private. And I would feel like I was betraying him by telling them.

I’m sorry I cannot reply to all of you, but please know I am reading all of the comments and making of plan of approach with them.

EDIT 2: for those talking about the dates and vacations bit that he pays for - I have asked him numerous times to help lighten my financial load instead of going on these trips and dates and he has refused. He said he can do what he wants with his money and if he wants to take us on vacation that is what he will pay for. If I could afford vacation I would pay. In fact, when we were in a more even financial situation, unmarried, not kids - I paid for almost ALL of our vacations and dates because I love to treat people. And I can’t do that anymore.

EDIT 3: I also DO NOT have bad spending habits. I worked my way out of my student loan debt in two years after graduating. I saved 60k but the time we got married, and I have that all in my retirement which I am thankful for because I can no longer contribute to it. This has NOTHING to do with how I spend. I am actually pretty frugal when it comes to shopping, especially since I prefer to keep things cheap for my budget.",Not the A-hole
AITA for walking around my house naked?,"My girlfriend works mornings so I have the house to myself. And what do I like to do? Walk around naked. 

My girlfriend and I are the only two people who have tje keys to the house, but she has a habit of lending her key out to her friends. 

I don't have a problem with that. My only problem is that she doesn't tell me when she does it.

So one morning I'm walking around naked and I hear somebody open the door and I think it's my girlfriend home early, but instead I see one of her friends. And I *ran* to the bedroom and threw some clothes on. 

We had a laugh about it, but my girlfriend got pissed when the friend told her and joked that I had ""a nice ass"". 

My girlfriend snapped at me later and told me to stop walking around naked. And I told her to tell me if she lent the key out to anybody so at least I can expect it and put on some clothes before they come. 

We agreed.

I kept walking around the house naked because uhhhh it's my house and I have the whole place to myself.

Guess what happened? The door opened one day and her friend - the same one - came in. Lol.

So, yeah, my girlfriend is pissed and says that I'm the asshole, but if she would've told me she had lent the key out again, her friend wouldn't have seen me naked again . XD",Not the A-hole
AITA for booting my mom & her negative attitude from the hospital room after my daughter was born?,"Settle in, this'll be a long one...

New 1st time dad here to a healthy little princess born this past Thursday. Unfortunately, the joy my wife & I felt in this scenario was temporarily halted by my mother's wholly inappropriate behavior that I'm just not ok with.

Some background: my mom has always been one of those people with a massive victim complex. People she knows go out to dinner & don't invite her? Must have been intentional. A decision is made without getting her input? Must have been done on purpose to spite her. You get the idea. 

This behavior manifested heavily 5 years ago when we got married and became a sore point for a long time. Once she found out we were expecting, again the negative behaviors came out. 

Tired of her leaving a stain on every moment that should be joyous, I finally had a sitdown with her. I told her in no uncertain terms that I wasn't going to raise my daughter in a negative environment like this, that we want her to be around and involved but her attitude needs to change. I was polite but firm about all of this. She resisted at first, resorting to her usual ways & thinking I was just plotting to get away from her completely, but in the end she claimed to have understood where I was coming from and promised to try and change her tone.

Well, the big day arrives and everyone is at the hospital. Baby is born, we had some bonding time as a family, then invited the grandparents (both sides) up to meet her. On arrival we introduced her and shared her name (we'd elected to keep it a secret). My wife and I come from different religious backgrounds and thus different naming traditions. Mine is to name after a departed loved one, hers is to name after a living relative. So our compromise was to name her after my grandmother (mom's mom) who passed a while ago and make the middle name for her mom, our daughter's grand mother.

After being in the room a bit and meeting her the question inevitably comes up of how we came up with her name. So I explain and at first she's beaming that her granddaughter is named for her mother, then when we get to the middle name her face changes to a look of pure anger and she says YOU DID WHAT?!? I calmly explain again, only to get OK, folded arms and a pouting demeanor clearly displaying her disapproval at this choice. This is supposed to be a happy occasion and I finally decided enough was enough and told her it was time to go. This lead to resistance from my dad, her going off the rails again about how everything is against her, and my wife hysterical that another even has been messed up. So I told my dad flat out that this behavior is the reason why and I won't have my kid around it, that when she's ready to behave like the grandmother we want our daughter around she can return but for today we're through. Apparently according to any and all in my family I'm the asshole for stepping in this way.

I don't think I did anything wrong here, but I leave that decision up to you guys. TIA",Not the A-hole
AITA for threatening to ban my brother from my wedding because he plans on proposing to his girlfriend during the reception?,"I (25M) am getting married in December. My fiancée (24F) and I both are very excited and busy planning, and this incident is making things much more stressful. 

A couple weeks ago I was talking about the wedding with my brother (30M) and he asked if it'd be okay for him to propose to his girlfriend at our wedding. I laughed and said ""Yeah, sure, if you want to get your ass handed to you by my fiancée"". He laughed, and I figured he got the message. 

The other day my fiancée came to me, in tears, saying that my brother had called her and thanked her for letting him propose at the wedding. She told him that had never happened, and he wasn't allowed to do that, and he just laughed and thanked her again. 

I called my brother back and asked him what was going on. He's insisting that he's going to propose to his girlfriend at the wedding. He claims it's ""getting even"" for when I announced our engagement at the same family dinner he brought his girlfriend to meet the family (I had no idea, they arrived separately and she got there after I had made the announcement). 

I told him if he doesn't get it through his head that he is absolutely not allowed to propose, both him and his girlfriend won't be allowed into the wedding at all, and if he tries to pull a stunt, he'll be kicked out immediately. 

He didn't take it well and told the whole family. My fiancée and I have been getting calls and messages from them telling us how shitty we are for doing that, how dare I turn my back on my brother. 

He's also now blaming me for spoiling the proposal to his girlfriend and the family, because if I hadn't been ""such an ass"", he wouldn't have had to break the news to the family like this. I still stand by what I did, I don't think I was out of line at all, but my fiancée thinks we should have just let him propose to avoid conflict. I know it means a lot to her that everyone gets along and that there's no hard feelings, especially since she's feeling stressed as is, but I don't want to give in to my brother. 

AITA?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I didn't expect this to get this many comments. 

To address something: while I understand the intent behind the suggestions, my fiancée and I will not be telling my brother that we'll announce a pregnancy at his wedding in retaliation. We are unable to conceive and this is a sore subject to us.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my husband we're supporting my mother till she dies?,"So I'm the daughter of 1st Gen Migrants to America. My father wanted to move here for more opportunities, and my mother, being a devoted housewife moved along with him. In my homeland's culture, women don't work once they're married and my mother married straight out of High School so she'd never had a job before.

My parents had me here, and when I was 8, my father passed away from cancer. My mother could have taken the easy route, she could have moved back to her homeland where relatives would look after us. But instead, she chose to get several jobs here (for cash so no benefits, no one was willing to have a middle aged foreigner that speaks little english work for them legitimately) and work hard to raise me in the US. If she'd gone home, I would probably have had to work on a farm till I died, but because of her, I got to have an education and have a well-paying office job. 

Since my mother had no benefits at her various jobs, I've always known it would be my duty to look after her in her old age. I've always been very upfront about everyone I've been in a relationship with, that my mother is a part of the package. That until she dies, I'll be paying for her bills, rent and some money for her to spend. My husband agreed to this when we started dating, and after we got married. 

But with corona, he got laid off, and we've been living off my income. I make quite a bit more than him, so we're still living solidly middle class lives, it's just that we don't have excess fun money anymore for hobbies till he gets another job. Obviously, my mother also is only receiving what she needs to get by too.

And now that it's affecting him, he's been making snide comments about my mother being a freeloader, and that she's still young enough to be working (she's in her late 60s). I told him to cut it out, that he knew what he was signing up for when he married me, so unless he wants to leave me, this is how it's going to be.

I didn't say the dreaded D word, but implying it was enough he stormed out. I got a few messages from my SIL and BIL about how I was being ridiculous expecting my husband to be second fiddle to my mother.

"AITA for telling an infertile woman that ""fur babies don't count""?","Alt account. Ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. 

Basically I [20M] recently started a job where I have mostly female coworkers. Amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. They go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. There is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. She refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so I assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. However, Friday I asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. Quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which I get bc I love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. When she later complained again about not being invited to something I kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, I don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". Coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

Turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. Obviously I feel *awful* now, I didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. Still I'm saved a little by the fact that I didn't know, right?

AITA for making a joke when people criticized my handling of my pregnancy?,"I'm pregnant, and I'm just so frustrated by people telling me how to live my life like I'm just some dumb incubator and not a person who can make decisions for myself.

AITA for not explicitly correcting my child's language?,"I am from a small non-English speaking country, but my partner is American and we live in the US. We have a five-year-old daughter who is in kindergarten this year. I almost always speak to my child in my native language. It's important to me that she learns my native language.

We've taken the approach of ""Don't explicitly correct when Daughter confuses the languages"". For example, if she says ""I want Mëllech"" instead of ""I want milk"", we ask ""Oh, do you want milk?"" instead of ""Not Mëllech, milk."" She doesn't get words confused as much anymore, but it does still happen.

Last week, she came home from school and has absolutely refused to speak anything but English, and was much, much quieter than normal. If I spoke to her in my native language, she would respond in English. I tried to read a book with her, and she started crying. I asked her why, and she said that she ""had to speak English"". After some more coaxing, she told me her teacher had told her she could only speak English because my language had ""naughty words"" and punished her by taking away recess.

I was furious, but I talked to her teacher the next day. She told me that my daughter was cursing in class and I needed to talk to her about appropriate language. I asked what words she was saying exactly, and was told ""ass"". Now, ""ass"" is ""is"" in my native language, and is pronounced more like ""ahs"" than the English word. I figured out that my daughter was switching ""ass"" and ""is"", and the teacher thought she was swearing at everybody.

I explained what I thought was happening to the teacher, and explained how to correct Daughter, and said that we would be more vigilant at home. The teacher absolutely refused and insisted that I stop speaking to Daughter in my native language because it was obviously confusing her and affecting her English ability. I told her nevermind and that she should leave all correction to to me and my husband, and that if I heard anything more from my daughter, I would be filing a complaint with the principal. She had no right to tell me how to raise my child, and to make my child cry for mixing up a word.

I was telling my friend about the incident, and she says that I made too much of a scene. I shouldn't threaten the teacher for trying to correct my daughter. But we've tried very hard to make both languages equal for my daughter, and now that work was undone by someone who apparently can't understand that a young child will mix up words sometimes. But I admit I was very angry in the moment and maybe wasn't thinking as I would if I was calm.

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. I am definitely continuing to teach my daughter my language. That was never up for debate. I was just wondering if I had been too harsh with the teacher.

And we've both sat down with our daughter and talked to her about what is happening. I think it will take some time though.",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my sister an idiot when she said she wants to name her baby “Anakin Skywalker”,"First name Anakin, middle name Skywalker. I wish I were kidding.

My sister is 19, four years younger than me, and she became pregnant unexpectedly with her boyfriend of only three months. She’s way too young for a kid, and that shows in a multitude of ways, but none so egregious as her name announcement.

She posted on Facebook yesterday a calligraphy banner with “Anakin Skywalker *last name*” printed on it.

I put a laugh react because obviously I thought it was a joke? But then later when I called her to ask for the real name she said “no, that’s exactly what we’ve decided to call him.” I asked how the BD felt about it and she said “well I’m carrying the baby for nine months and pushing it out of MY body so I get name privileges.” Wtf.

I said dude, you know this kid is going to be abysmally bullied, right? You’re giving him a name that is fully entrenched in pop culture. It’s not a name that he can fit to his own identity, he’s going to be known as Darth Vader his whole fucking life. I then said I didn’t even know my sister was a Star Wars fan.

She responded “It’s not about Star Wars at all, just really love the name Anakin Skywalker, it has good sonics (???). I’m sure people won’t care if he’s called Anakin.”

I started laughing and told her she’s an idiot for not seeing the problem here, and she got really really mad. She hung up on me and evidently called my parents because they FaceTimed me later and while dad thought it was an absolute riot, mom told me off for not being “gentle with my sister during a difficult time”.

I just can’t believe my nephew is going to be fully named after the most iconic villain in history. Lol, what the hell. It’s almost funny if you don’t think about how much it would genuinely suck to be named Darth Vader.

WIBTA if I report my doorman for calling me pretentious?,"I moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. It's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. I always say a pleasant, ""Hi, how are you? Have a nice day/evening"" to them when I leave or enter the building, but I don't stop to chat to them as I have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200B;

One of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as I'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. I usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as I'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200B;

The other day he shouted out to me, ""Come here, Miss Pretentious,"" so this time I turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""What did you call me?"" He then proceeds to say I'm pretentious and obviously think I'm better than everyone else in the building because I won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. His tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. I politely explained that it's not that I think I'm better than everyone but that I'm just really tired after work and want to go home. I also said I find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as I'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if I wanted to). He ended by saying that I won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if I keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. I told him (again, politely) that I wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and I then walked away.

&#x200B;

Since then I have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""Hello, Miss Pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as I walk into the building. I have completely ignored him both times.

&#x200B;

I feel like I should probably talk to him and tell him I don't appreciate being called that, but honestly I just want to report him to his supervisor as I'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building).

"AITA for still calling my stepdad ""dad""?","Sorry it's a throwaway. 

So I never knew my biological dad. He and mum weren't serious and she doesn't like to talk about him, I don't even know his name. However, when I was 5 she married my stepdad and he was great! He had two kids (twins, 6 years older than me) already himself and he never treated me any different from them. Like, he literally got himself, his other son and me matching team jumpers with our names on for when we go to the rugby. Then, last year, him and mum got divorced. I've not been findng it super easy, especially since mum has a new partner now and he isn't as nice to me as my stepdad was, but I'm okay. 

Here's the issue though. For the 9 years they were married I called my stepdad ""Dad"". Like, if people asked me or I was talking about him I'd say my stepdad, but if I was addressing him directly I'd call him Dad, if that makes any sense at all. I haven't stopped doing it since they got divorced. I've been sleeping over at his house every other weekend, and seeing him sometimes on other days to do activities and things. Keep calling him dad. I will admit us hanging out has kind of been tapering off, though. 

Anyway, my big sister offered me a lift to school this morning. She told me when we were in the car that I should stop being so attached to Dad and that I should even stop calling him Dad. I asked why, and she said that he isn't my real dad. I told her I know that but he's been my dad for the last decade. She said no, he was my stepdad because he was married to my mum and now he isn't so he isn't anything to me any more. She said that he was letting me stay and things at first to be polite but now it was getting silly, I'm not a baby any more, I need to grow up etc. I asked if this was coming from him or if it was her own idea and she said ""what do you think?"" 

I'm very upset. I'm on morning break at school rn and I haven't been able to focus in class all morning. I feel terrible that I've been making him think that he has to treat me a certain way and I feel like a stupid baby for being so clingy. I talked to my mate about it and he said my sister isn't being fair and neither is my stepdad if this was his idea but idk. I just feel really really really bad for having been so stupid.

AITA for telling my parents I have no plans to be involved in my unborn siblings life and I think they are wrong for having another kid at their age?,"I'm a 21 year old college student currently stuck at home due to a viral pandemic. Both me and my sister (19 years old) moved back in when our dorms closed and plan to leave back for school in the fall (if the colleges re-opens).

The problem here comes from the fact that this week our parents (mom is 45 and dad is 53) decided to drop on us that mom is 3 months pregnant. Suffice to say, this situation is strange. I didn't dare ask but my guess is this is a ""whoopsie"" child. The thing that really caused issue though was not only are they planning on carrying the kid to term, they have slowly started hinting over the week that they expect me and my sister to stay nearby and ""be a brother and sister"" and help them out with this kid.

Ignoring the fact that my parents are already past middle age, this will not work at all. I graduate next year and am most likely moving to the other side of the US or even out of the country (I interned last summer in Germany and plan to apply to the company there). The same applies for my sister as she want's to move to France and work there. Both of my parents know this, yet as I've talked about htis over the week they seem like they think me and my sister need to stay close so we can be a ""family"".

Last night this kinda came to a head. My dad started talking to me about my plans after college and told me about businesses nearby that I could apply too. I told him that I had no intent to work here because the money I could make in other places is much better. We talked about this for a while before he dropped ""you know it will be hard for you too be a good big brother if you live so far away right?"". This was the last straw for me honestly and I bluntly told him that I really didn't care and I had no real intent to be in the kids life.

This was the wrong thing to say. Me and him started arguing and eventually my mom and sister got pulled in. I told my parents that it's incredibly selfish of them to not only expect me and my sister to drop our plans for them and this kid, but to also bring a kid into this world and raise it at their ages. My mom broke down at this and my dad started yelling claiming that i'm extremely selfish and childish and that I am horrible for shaming them like this.

They've been avoiding me since the fight outside of my mom crying to me today about how much i'm hurting them. I just got a call from my aunt calling me all sorts of names including asshole. She says that I am causing my mom and dad a ton of stress and that I owe it to them to be there for my sibling

I don't know how i'm in the wrong here. I'm an adult. This is the first time i've lived at home in 2 years and I have my own life ahead of me. How am I the asshole for just stating facts and not wanting to drop everything and plan around what I think is a mistake.

Edit:

Since there's nearly 2 k comments and I'm not gonna stay up past midnight responding to everyone I'll just put here some stuff most people want to know along with just my personal take away. 

On the topic of why I said what I said. 

My relationship with my father is complicated, to much so for me to even get into it here. But, my father has a mind set that he is ""Too old"" to do certain things. And will use this card to try to guilt me and my sister into doing things. This, along with a multitude of other personal reasons that have nothing to do with this post is the reason I decided to not come back until a virus that has shut down many parts of the world forced me home. 

This is part of why I used their ages in my argument. I don't have anything against older parents, I just believed my parents are in a place in their lives where having a child would be a bad idea. Was this wrong of me? Probably. Will I apologize for it? Yes. 

However, I stand by what I said originally. I believe that my parents intentions were to have me and my sister take responsibility in some way for this child. There are reasons why I believe this that again go into my relationship with them. This is why I reacted the way I did, because I believe they want to use me and my sister to co-raise this child. I stand by my statement about not wanting to be involved as a ""big brother"" and accept any judgement that brings

AITA for costing a car salesmen his commission?,"I need a new car as my old ones is over 35 years old and on it's last legs. I also decided to get a upper end luxury car which was a huge upgrade from my old but reliable Volvo since I figured I'd earned it and I could pay for it outright.

I took my boyfriend with me to the dealership as you do as a couple. 

A salesman approached us and the entire time, from the start to finish, kept talking to my boyfriend even though I clearly introduced myself and told him the car was for me and that I would be paying outright for it.

My boyfriend was off put by thing and kept referring the salesman to me when he asked my boyfriend a question and even pointedly said at some point "" I don't know, it's Delicious\_Cancel's car, ask her"".

The salesmen would then look at me, I'd answer and then the next question, back to my boyfriend. 

The only question I was asked was around colour preference and leather vs fabric interior. 

I was kind of internally fuming at this point. The final straw was after the test drive (of course he gave the keys to my BF), I said that I really liked the guy and he turned to my BF and asked if he should get the paperwork ready.

I interjected and said I wanted to think about it. I had already decided on the car but I didn't want to commission to go to him. My boyfriend could tell I was a bit upset about this interaction and offered to go to another dealership with me tomorrow or leave a review or something.

So we left and came back the next morning, a different salesperson greeted us and this one was much better, ridiculously charming, flattered me by saying a hard working woman like me deserved a good car and all the flattery I was expecting when being sold to. 

I told him we'd driven the car yesterday and decided to buy it and we did, no hassles. I even managed to negotiate some extras since I told him I was giving him a sale for very little effort on his part.

I was recounting this story to a friend of mine yesterday who is sales (but in IT) told me I was a bit of an asshole because the previous salesman had done all the work and I gave the sale to someone else when I was wanting to buy the car anyway. 

He said I should have asserted myself a bit more on the spot and given the previous salesman more of a chance rather than try to screw him over behind his back because now he'd never know why he'd lost the sales. He also said that sales was a tough job and maybe old habits die hard. Or if I didn't want to buy from him at all, I should have given him a concrete reason so he could learn.

I think my thing is, it's 2020 and it's basic sales 101 to speak to the person who holds the purse-strings. Also it's not my job to teach a saleperson anything, I just want to have a smooth experience buying a car.

So AITA for going out of my way to not give a sale to what I believed was a sexist salesman?",Not the A-hole
AITA for legally suspending my daughter's license?,"My daughter is 16. Myself and her mom separated when she was 12, and we both live in the same town and maintain a healthy relationship, and split custody 50/50. I taught my daughter how to drive, and was with her when she got her license last month. Last week, my daughter came home with a ticket for texting and driving on the highway. This caused a huge concern for me. The ticket included a $200 fine and a 20 day suspension of her license.

I was obviously very upset and we got into an argument about it. Her points were that ""everyone does it"" and that she doesn't do that often, or when other cars are around. Not only was she defending herself, but she was essentially arguing that she does it safely. I told her that regardless of when the suspension kicks in, she is grounded from driving until she has shown that she can be responsible enough to not put her own life, or the other lives on the road, in danger. I took her car keys (a car that I had bought for her as a getting-your-license present).

She went and called her mom before I did, and next thing I know, I have her calling me and telling me that I had no right to punish her like that without talking to her first. I agreed that I should have talked to her first about it, but that I feel like the grounding is nonnegotiable. Her mom actually took her side, and said the same ""everyone does it"" bullshit, and that she needs a car to get to work and hang out with friends. I told her that it is ridiculous that she is even supporting this. The conversation ended with her telling me that she wasn't going to enforce the rule, and would allow her to drive one of her cars at her house.

I waited a few days, until it was her mom's turn of custody. I called her and she confirmed that she isn't backing off, and that she is going to let her drive until the suspension kicks in. I told her that she is actively letting our child endanger her life as well as everyone else's. She told me I am making this a much bigger deal out than it needs to be, and she said that if it was actually that serious, she would have gotten more than a 20 day suspension.

In my state, the parent that signed the minor-driving consent form when you get your license has the ability to have your license revoked, so I did just that. They warned me that this will count as a full revocation on her record, and that she will be ineligible to get it again until she is 18. I went through with it and texted her mother to tell her that I revoked her license, and sent her a picture of the paper the DMV sent me. She told me I am out of line and making decisions for our daughter without consulting her. I told her that she was neglecting her safety and I wasn't going to allow her to enable our daughter to endanger herself or someone else on the road. My daughter is livid at me, and so is her mom, but I feel like I did what I had to do.

AITA for apologizing to my aunt for having to take care of me as a child?,"I'm an adult now, (24F) don't live with my parents. 


I have a pretty complicated relationship with my mother. She is an artist, but didn't have much recognition. Her paintings are generally brilliant but the art world is an incredibly sexist and classist arena - hence she never really got the formal recognition she wanted until right now (when there's conversations about gender and class in art and things are opening up). Complications were primarily due to the fact that she was excessively critical of everything I did - it led to some distance pretty early on. My mother couldn't bear to be interrupted when she was painting so she usually fobbed me off to my aunt who was going to university at the time. My dad couldn't keep me because he had to sustain our household as well as my mom's career. 

As I grew up, I realized that my mother is what she is and nothing can change that. When I gave up that illusion of control, my relationship with her improved drastically. I simply stopped expecting things from her and it was better this way. I never really sought therapy, my parents absence from my life generally made me really independent from the get go. My aunt took care of me but looking back, she was just barely an adult so it was just hanging out with an inexperienced nanny. 

Recently, I came across an old photograph of my aunt giving me a bath. It was a sweet photo. I decided to give her a just because gift. I put the photo in a frame I made myself (I enjoy woodworking) and inscribed the words ""you gave up your life so I could live mine. Thank you, I love you"". I'd never actually said the words ""I'm sorry"" so I said it too. She cried a lot, but my aunt is a kind soul so she doesn't regret that taking care of me often got in the way of her own life. Anyway, she loved the gift and displayed it in her home. 

My mother saw it, and got really upset. It came to head the last time I visited home - she asked me point blank if I thought she was a bad mother. I was pretty honest and said she was barely a mother and our relationship improved because I stopped expecting things from her and still don't. She got really upset and said that I didn't know the struggle of building a career as an artist while also taking care of a home. She said she built a legacy and a career as an artist because she didn't want her kids to live in the world that she did. That art can change the world, and she may have been distant but she loved me deeply. 

To be honest, I'm a filmmaker myself today and i owe a large part of my art to my mother. It's the one thing i inherited from her. But it's also true that someone had to take care of me when I was a child because responsibilities don't disappear when we don't fulfill then... That was my aunt and she deserves appreciation for putting her life on hold. 

My mother was silent, but later, I caught her crying. I don't know how to feel about this? Am I an asshole?

Edit: this absolutely blew up! Thank you to everyone for their perspective, it gave me a lot to think about vis a vis my mother and I. I sent her a text today, hopefully we can talk later. Thank you for all the wonderful awards - I feel the love and care!",Not the A-hole
AITA for mentioning that I had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?,"I’m posting this from my wife’s account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I’m the asshole. 

This is a topic we’ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It’d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can’t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I’m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn’t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife’s contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife’s perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he’d complain I’d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn’t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I’d like to also mention it wasn’t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. 

He is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",Asshole
AITA for rubbing my belly?,"I’m (28F) 6 months pregnant and the first in my family to be pregnant. My family has reacted weirdly towards my pregnancy so far, but this is a whole new level. I’m wondering if I’m TA or not.

Being this far along, I am constantly feeling the baby moving inside me. She presses on my bladder and makes a ruckus in there. I found that gently rubbing my belly up and down (over my clothes) “calms” her down and keeps her from jabbing my insides with her feet. 

Due to COVID I haven’t been able to see my parents until last weekend. So far I it’s just been me and my fiancé celebrating the pregnancy, so I was excited to show them pictures of my ultrasound and catch up.

My sisters (30F & 28F) came over to visit while I was at my parent’s house. We were sitting around and chatting when I felt the baby start to act up so I absent mindedly began to rub my belly. My sisters both gave me a look like I was doing something disgusting. They asked me why I was rubbing my belly and told me to stop after I explained. They said it made them uncomfortable. I obliged and stopped thinking they were just being weird.

An hour later I was grilling with my fiancé and was rubbing my belly again. My older sister saw and snapped at me. She told me to stop, it was weird, and I looked like Buddha rubbing his gut. It was offensive, but I stopped to keep the peace. I just wanted to have a good time.

Later we went out for ice cream. Before I got in the car, my twin sister (who is ALSO pregnant but not showing yet) stopped me and made me promise not to rub my belly in the car. She said loudly (to make my older sister laugh, I guess) “No belly-rubbing Buddha’s in MY car.” I said ok. I just wanted ice cream.

While standing in line for ice cream, I began absent mindedly rubbing my belly again. My sister saw, snapped, and shouted “THELACKADAISICAL! STOP! That’s SO weird!” Everyone at the ice cream joint turned and stared at me. It was so embarrassing!

Before leaving for home, I asked my mom what my sisters’ problems were with me. My mom said it was the belly rubbing and it was weird. My fiancé had my back and said explained that it calms the movements and it’s completely normal for me to do that. My mom said I was being overreactive and to imagine how hard it must have been for her when she was pregnant with twins. This still didn’t answer my question, but my mom told me to be “normal” around my sisters and to stop being so sensitive. 

I feel weird bc I thought I wasn’t doing anything wrong! So reddit, am I the big-bellied AH?

EDIT: TL;DR: I rubbed my pregnant belly in front of my family and they felt uncomfortable.

EDIT 2: I’m humbled by the power of reddit! Thank you all so much for your reassurance and advice. I realize now that my actions were normal but my family has some issues they need to work through on their own. I’m not going to waste my time trying to figure out their problems. I’m gonna keep on rubbing my belly and enjoying myself. Maybe I’ll update later after the baby arrives! Thank you all again!! Love, big Buddha belly <3",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to change my accent and laughing in a classmate's face after she told me my accent is offensive?,"A bit of a weird post but please bear with me.

I(19f) am from Germany and I also go to university there. Because of my major I have to take some advanced english classes, this incident happened about two months ago.

About three years ago I went to England for a month and I stayed with an english guest family there. Naturally all of them spoke with a heavy english accent and after a few weeks I started to adpot that accent.

It's normal for guest students to adopt a certain accent for the duration of their stay according to my guest family but what's weird is that my accent didn't go away after I returned to Germany. I have been speaking with an english accent ever since and it's pretty normal to me now but I still write and use American english words like ""color"" instead of ""colour"" and ""fries"" instead if ""chips"".

That was three years ago.

My english class at univerity last semester was pretty diverse with studenty from many different countries. One student was from England so naturally she also spoke with an english accent.

Our class included a lot of speaking exercises since the course was predominantely vistited by students whose second language is english.

During our last class of the semester one of my new friends (not the english girl my story is about) asked me why I speak with an english accent when I'm German. I shortly explained that I spent some time in England and that's why I speak the way I speak.

The english girl was sitting right next to me so she must've overheard. After class she pulled me aside and and told me how offensive she thinks my accent is because I'm not English so I shouldn't pretend that I am. She also called my accent ""borderline cultural appropriation"".

I was so confused in that moment that I just chuckled, said ""okay"" and walked away. I pretty much forgot about this incident afterwards until I checked the new entry list for the class and saw her name on it.

So AITA for speaking with an english accent even though I'm not english and laughing in the girl's face after she confronted me about it? I really don't know if it's an AH move of me to speak with an accent where I'm not from.

EDIT: A lot of comments don't really believe that my accent changed within only one month and accuse me of faking it to seem ""special"". I honestly don't know what to say except for yes, my accent is real and changed within that time span. I also didn't change the way I speak conciously, it just happened and I never even felt the desire to adopt an english accent or any other accent for that matter. Hope that clears things up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for washing my boyfriend's clothes?,"My (22F) boyfriend (27M) asked me to wash some of his clothes for him since I was doing laundry today. I told him to put any clothes he wanted washed in my hamper and I'd include them.

He left his wallet in a pair of pants to be washed, but I didn't notice as I was putting them into the washing machine, and I assumed he would have checked them anyway considering he had already put them in my hamper. So basically, I accidentally washed his wallet.

He was looking to leave the house (and he is NOTORIOUS for misplacing his keys and wallet and then freaks when he can't find them when he wants to leave) and couldn't find his wallet, so he starts getting angry and asking if I've seen it. I asked him if he maybe left it in the pants he asked me to wash.

He says, ""you didn't check? What the fuck?"" And I said ""no, I don't leave my wallet in my pants so I don't think to check."" Cue anger from him. I go and stop the wash cycle (had been running for about 5 minutes) and check, and lo and behold, there's his wallet. Soaked.

Luckily, literally nothing was ruined- all his business cards, money, ID etc is totally fine, just needs a little while to dry. But he is so incredibly, seemingly irrationally angry at me and said I was being careless and that I've ruined his day by accidentally washing his wallet.

At first I apologized, but now I'm kind of upset that he blames me completely and is telling me to never touch his clothes again, ""let's not talk about it because I'm too mad to speak to you,"" etc. I feel like it was an honest mistake and quite frankly now I'm pissed at him for making such a big deal out of it. 

He's stomping around the house like a toddler right now slamming doors because he ""doesn't get to go"" to the gun show he wanted to, but I don't understand why he can't go with a wet wallet? None of his cash set aside to purchase the gun was even in the wallet, so it's all dry, and he could still purchase the gun. 

Anyway, I want to know if I'm biased and if I really did do something wrong by not checking his pants and even giving him some sass by saying ""I don't leave my wallet in my pants.""

AITA for making my SIL cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?,"I come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and I do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). We’ve always been very generous to his side of the family. Gifts are very much both my husband and my “love language” and in my culture (Chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. It also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. Additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. One concern of mine originally was to treat my husband’s family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

Last Christmas, we had some weirdness over Christmas day present opening. I had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for SIL (husband’s brother’s wife). She googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later I overheard her make some joke about how she could pay “half a mortgage payment.”  Several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she’s tired of us “throwing our money” in her and her husband’s face, and Christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. Husband and I apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

This past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It’s the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one’s college fund as well but didn’t feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, “We don’t need your money.”

I kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I’ve been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.

(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)

(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn’t quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious “ designer” brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn’t looked it up I don’t think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting my boyfriend’s best friends use my airline discount after saying they could?,"Throwaway because all parties know my account name.

Backstory: My boyfriend (Alex\*) and I have been together for 4 years, I’ve become friends with his two best friends (James\* and Noah\*) but we’re not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. I work for an airline and one of the major perks is that I get discounts on flights that I can also use for family and friends. As I am in my first year with the company I only get a certain number of discount seats and I had 3 left for the year.

Situation: Alex asked me if I could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. I happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. He booked his time off work and they made their plans. They were to send me the money and then I would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

Three nights ago Alex came home really upset. He told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. He was upset because he couldn’t move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. I was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. To make up for I started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

James messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. No ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. I was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. I sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and Noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as I would be using the seats for me and Alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. He replied with a barrage of texts saying that I was being selfish and unfair as I had “promised” two seats to him and Noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. He even phoned Alex to complain. Alex is torn. He thinks it’s a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn’t want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so I should just give them the seats to keep the peace. I refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

Am I the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I must admit I know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the NTA votes but I hate going back on my word and I guess I did feel a bit like an asshole just because I've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so I needed some honest opinions. This sub has shown me the light and I will be showing Alex this when I get home. He is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if I have to grow it in a lab. I'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. Any holiday suggestions?

2ND UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your votes and insights. It made me realise that even though most of you have voted me NTA, there are some things I hadn’t considered. I have spoken to Alex and shown him this thread (guess I don’t know why I used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. He apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn’t stand up for himself and I apologised for not discussing my choice with him before I told his friends they can’t use my discount in the way that I did. He said he’s just going to let it play out but he’ll be willing to forgive them eventually. So for those wanting a final dramatic update, I don’t think we’ll be getting one.

AITA for telling my SO he'll need to limit gym time after baby?,"I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. This pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, I wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. During the newborn phase, I was SO exhausted. I was breastfeeding, baby had colic, I was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. I do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and I was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

My husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. He would silently be ticked if I asked him to not go to the gym. I truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). But sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. Sometimes, I NEEDED another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. Example: one Saturday I got up to pump. They were both awake (8:00am). He said he was going to head to the gym since I was awake, and I started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and I got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" I told him that it must be nice to even have the ENERGY to go to the gym. The ONLY thing I wanted to be able to do was sleep. I got the response ""I'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

Now that I'm pregnant again, I mentioned to him ""if I thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am I supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" I told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. Well, he did not receive this kindly. He texted me the next day ""Just to be clear, I feel like I do a lot. I will not be able to help out with daycare, as I drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. I will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and I need to go to relieve stress. The reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while I think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. You need to think about if you want this baby. ""

I fucking lost it.

I said ""I cannot believe you would rather me have an abortion than make any more sacrifices regarding your gym time."" But he is adamant that I am the selfish one

AITA for telling my GF I do not want her sterilising her menstrual cup in our kettle?,"My GF and I have been together for nearly 2 years now. We get along great and already have moved in with each other. I am a pretty laid back guy and like to ""go with the flow"", whilst she is very organised and likes to take charge, which works very well for us because we are always pulling in the same direction because our personalities match up well!

A couple of months or so ago we were having the conversation about women's sanitary products. We were discussing how expensive they are etc and we got onto the subject of ""menstrual cups"" (the ones where you can just keep reusing them, so it would save us so much money in the long run. My GF looked them up, we did some research and ordered one (specifically one called ""mooncup"")

It took my GF a while to get used to it, but by her second period she was accustomed to it; problem solved!

Now here is where the issue begins... I live in the UK and as many of you probably know, us Brits love a cup of tea... Whenever I make a cup of tea I always empty out the old water from the kettle, just so I can fill it up with fresh water and maximise the flavour. Yesterday I poured all the water out of the kettle to make myself a brew, and my GF's menstrual cup fell out of it!!

I was a bit shocked and called out to my GF (in the other room) ""Babe, why is your menstrual cup in the kettle?!""; 

To which she replied ""Oh I was boiling it to 'sterilise' it, to make sure it is clean for my next use, I thought you knew, this isn't the first time I have used the kettle to sterilise it""

I was lost for words and told her that is disgusting, we drink water from this kettle, who in their right mind would use it to boil something that collects blood from inside of you???

AITA for sticking up for an ex instead of my girlfriend?,"Throwaway. My girlfriend and I are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. I need to know if ITA. 

I’m in a very LDR with basically the girl of my dreams. Absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. Things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. 

She came to town, and I was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked “are there any girls I should be worried about” This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn’t seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn’t a big deal. 

Everything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. 

GF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. 

I apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said “no worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes” (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I didn’t tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. 

We got into the biggest argument about how I didn’t have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can’t be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. 

She’s now back on a plane, and we will “discuss further” once she clears her head.

Am I the asshole?

Edit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. 

Edit 2: update: I’ve gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. I admitted that I’m an asshole for how I’ve gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. I adore her, but I’m not comfortable with the default response being “I’m jealous, I’m going to be rude to someone I don’t know” 

She is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always “choose” the other girl. I tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that I can’t do anything about that, but I do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. Every one of them, and I definitely think she can recover. But she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it’s probably not going to developed past this. 

For the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren’t strictly platonic. Yes, I understand her comment was towards me. Plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess I should take a page out of his book. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my ex I refuse to share custody of our daughter?,"My ex an I have an incredibly long history. We met when I was 18 and he was 19. He was my first love and we dated about a year. But after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until I turned 23. Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...

He was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

When I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I’d be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child’s life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn’t an option. 

I myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it’s a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.

After begging him to be in the baby’s life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

At first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

I took sole custody of course. It’s been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven’t seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. 

I get a call and it’s my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can’t just say no because he’s gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

I was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he’s ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. 

I’ve told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I’m just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child. I know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but I just feel like I need to fight this. AITA for being so against him getting any custody?

Edit: for all the people that are confused about age. We met in late teens. Got pregnant when I was 23 and he was 24. I’m 30 now and he’s 31.

Edit2: for all the people that are saying I’m TA for not getting an abortion. Thanks! BUT I remember asking if I was an ass for telling my ex I’ll fight him over custody. Please stop telling me I should have aborted my 7 year old daughter. It’s very much too late and I never asked for your opinion on that matter.",Not the A-hole
AITA for scaring my my daughter to teach her not to scare animals?,"My daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


She would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""WA!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


We tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. She thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


So a while earlier she was on the sofa playing Nintendo switch, looking very focused, and I decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


I approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""WA!"". She was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


My wife called me a childish AH for scaring her like that, but I meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. AITA?


Edit: I did talked to her and explain why I did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted I apologise and make it up for her. I don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so I ended up posting on reddit to see if I am really in the wrong.


Edit 2: Thank you for the comments, I shall leave a little update here. I am glad that most people here agrees with me to the point of becoming Validation Post. The silly thing is that that this same post sparked another argument between me and my wife and our daugher was the one who made us cut it out, talk about being mature adults!",Not the A-hole
AITA for turning my son into the police?,"My 16 year old son was catfishing people on the internet for petty cash (10-50 dollars per person.) 

I couldn’t believe it. I don’t know how I screwed up as a parent this badly to fail to instill in him that this is wrong and morally depraved behavior. 

I asked why he’d do this to innocent people, mostly elderly people, and he said he needed money to buy things we wouldn’t buy him (video gaming equipment, expensive sneakers, etc.) 

I told him when he asked for those things to go get a job, but he said it would take too long to save up for those things with a job and this was faster. 

His excuse was if they’re stupid enough to fall for his scam, they deserve to have their money taken. But he swore he wouldn’t do it again. 

I didn’t believe him. I couldn’t risk that. I felt I needed him to have a wake up call now when there’s still a chance he’ll turn this behavior and life outlook around. 

I collected all the evidence of what he’d done and reported him to the police. 

After I did this, I was devastated, and called a friend to vent and ask where I’d gone wrong in raising him. 

She was horrified. Not at his behavior but at what I’d done. She said there was no reason I couldn’t have settled the problem within the home and didn’t have to open my son up to the risks of the legal system. 

Now I’m even more broken up. And I don’t want to put our business out there by running the situation by many other people.

AITA for making my children pay for their own portion of our family vacation?,"We have been planning on going on vacation to cuba for the Christmas holidays for a week. It’s pretty pricey during the Christmas holidays but that’s the only time we can all go. We have three children 20F, 15M, and 12F who we are making them pay for their own ticket and part of the hotel since we wouldn’t be financially stable enough to pay for 5 plane tickets and such. 

My 12 year old daughter has been complaining that since the other two have jobs and she doesn’t that it’s not fair. However we’ve decided to stick firm with it and be equal to them all. Their other option if they don’t want to pay is staying at grandmas. She has savings which are just enough to cover the vacation but she also wants to save up for a phone. My other two children aren’t happy that they have to pay for their own but they are willing to since we’d be going to cuba. 

AITA for making them pay? I feel like most families don’t make their children pay for their own tickets but since we all really want to go my wife and I think it’s the best option.

AITA for dropping my daughter from my wife and I’s medical insurance?,"My daughter is 23 and just got a call from her gynecologist. 

She apparently had previously had an abnormal Pap smear that she never informed us about. However, then she got a biopsy which came back abnormal and she probably needs LEEPs. 

I am very disappointed because I know she got HPV from a boyfriend I disapproved of because he was obviously someone who didn’t look like he’d be loyal. And now she’s stuck with the consequences and my wife and I feel like if we pay for her treatment it would be condoning it. We feel that she has no right to be sobbing and hyperventilating while also going on the “ it’s not my fault mantra” and we don’t want to enable her further.

Now we are making steps towards ensuring that we will never have to pay for anything she needs medically, and for that matter materially anymore. Her credit cards have been cut off but the dropping from insurance process hasn’t progressed that far. 

What makes us even angrier is the fact that she had just lost her entry level job due to her company closing down and she chooses to continue to see unreliable boyfriends. We raised her better- I built a great family business from nothing and I shudder at what people would think if they knew my daughter got an STD from sleeping around at such a young age.

AITA for reporting a delivery driver who I thought was lying to get out of doing more work?,"Throwaway account because I don’t want this linked to my main.

So today for lunch I decided to order from a Mexican restaurant through one of those food delivery services. I’ve had a bad experience or two where my order was missing some items, but the drivers would always be gone before I realized and could catch them to fix the issue. I’d always have to report it through the app’s support chat, which is such a pain to use because they obviously outsource their representatives and it’s frustrating trying to communicate with them. I usually give up after a few messages back and forth.

When my driver arrived, I told her to stay so that I could check the bag and make sure everything was there. I noticed she kind of raised her eyebrow for a moment but otherwise she stood quietly and waited. Sure enough, a couple things were missing. I politely said she needed to return to the restaurant and get my missing items.

In a very neutral, rehearsed-sounding tone, she said that it’s “against company policy to do that and I should contact support through the app.” I explained that I preferred not to deal with support. She said they’re the only ones who can help and she’s *really* not supposed to go back to the restaurant. 

I was a bit annoyed at this point so I asked what the company policy was on making sure orders were correct. She said that restaurants close the bags for the drivers and they’re not meant to open them or the containers inside. Something about food safety violations and not being trained (?). After a moment she apologized for the trouble and left. 

To me this honestly just sounds like a bunch of BS excuses to get out of doing her whole job. If they “can’t go back to the restaurant,” how are customers supposed to get their food/money back? If they “can’t open bags to check the orders” how do they even know they’re delivering the right food? It makes no sense to me.

So on the page where I rate my driver and can leave feedback, I made a note of my situation and explained why I thought she was in the wrong. I then left one star and revoked my tip.
A bit later I was talking to my sister over the phone, who I thought would enjoy the story because she works for a different-but-similar delivery company. My sister said “did you ACTUALLY think she was gonna go back to the restaurant?” I laughed, thinking she was taking a dig at a competing company’s drivers, but she just said “I’m not joking, you literally reported her for following the rules.”

At first I thought my sister had misunderstood a part of the story or something so I kind of brushed it off, but now based on her reaction and what both her and the driver said, I’m wondering if they’re right? AITA for reporting her and taking my tip back because I thought she was lying?",Asshole
Aita for tricking my friend into drinking beer?,"So, title sounds wrong, but hear me out.

He’s the type of dude who never has fun in his life, doesn’t smoke/drink. The problem, is I want him to at least experience real fun. 

2 weeks ago, I brought some beer with my money, and went to his house, I drank a bit then said hey, have a try. He declined, saying he doesn’t drink, his religion doesn’t allow him to, and even if he could, he wouldn’t. He proceeds to ask me why I enjoy drinking something that destroys the brain, and I was deeply offended, beer isn’t bad. 

(He’s a muslim). So, I made up a plan. He won’t hate it, if he doesn’t know it’s beer. So, last week, we were hanging out, and went to a mall. We bought some stuff, and I bought apple juice. Skip to last 4 days, he came over, (note: no lockdown where we live) and I put some beer, he asked what it is and I said oh, just some apple juice. Also, i poured some for me and said, let’s see who can chug it all first? 

He was skeptical, but went for it, and drank all of it, he just made a weird face and said it tastes weird. That night, he called and asked if I was vomiting/dizzy/feel weird. I said no.

The side effects was making him vomit, feel dizzy and weird. Well, because of that I felt guilty and told him, and, he flipped out at me, shouting at how it tasted disgusting, made him vomit, feel dizzy, he couldn’t sleep because he kept feeling like he’s spinning whenever he closes his eyes. I said bullshit and he’s making stuff of to get mad at me.

I don’t think I’m the AH because I wanted him to have some fun, I think he’s the asshole for not understanding that. Aita?

aita for telling my neighbor she needs to stop with flaunting her money and spoiling her kids,"This happened in august. I have 4 kids and am a single mom who only gets $239 each month in child support. My neighbor has 2 daughters with a husband whose a lawyer and she's a nurse so her kids are spoiled rotten. When I caught wind of her taking his kids school shopping I asked if I could have a lift to the local walmart since I didnt want to waste money with having to take myself and the kids on the bus and she said sure. We were dropped off at walmart and I told my kids they could get 1 special school item so my 2 daughters got sparkly mechanical pencils and my 1 son got a dinosaur notebook and my other son got colorful gel pens. There was frozen pizzas on sale and since we cant afford to order pizza and only have frozen pizzas on occasion I said why not and bought one for dinner and then I got them some new school clothes

When neighbor picked us up a few hours later her backseat and trunk were FILLED with garbage from Justice, Abercrombie, Staples etc plus they had To Go bozes. Our kids were talking about what they got and her kids had gotten all high priced crap from these stores. Her one daughter went ""mommy got us steak for dinner at roadhouse"" and my youngest said we had gotten a frozen pizza which broke my damn heart. While I spent probably 75-100$ tops my neighbor probably spent hundreds on her kids. On the way home the daughters were begging for McDonalds sundaes so neighbor pulls in the drive thru and asks me if my kids would like any. I said yes, assuming she was paying but then she ordered SEPARATELY and asked for the money. I forked the money over that was supposed to be for getting my hair done next week

When we got home I took neighbor aside and told her that I dont appreciate her rubbing her money in my kids faces. I try to make their lives easy with the little things here and there but then she goes ahead and spoils her kids rotten RIGHT in front of my kids. She told me shes allowed to spend her money the way she sees fit with her children and I told her that her kids are spoiled and dont need all that high priced crap. She hasnt spoken to me since and I have struggled since I used to rely on favors from her and its starting to drive me insane. Am I the asshole for calling out her materialistic ways?",Asshole
AITA for kicking my son and his girlfriend out of our beach house?,"We spend every fourth of July weekend at our beach house. This has never been a family trip. Since both of my children are now adults they are welcomed to come if they really want to, but they have to understand they are going to witness some behavior that might make them uncomfortable. My daughter came once and said never again, and this year my son wanted to come with his girlfriend. We'll call them Brian and Anna.

Anna was a major buzzkill from the beginning. She lectured us about pool safety. Now I understand my wife and her friend getting drink and play fighting on cement is not pool safety, but we're all adults. She made comments about the drinking and  every time one of  my friends made an offensive joke. We went out on the boat and my wife's friend wanted to go topless and Anna told me in private that it made her uncomfortable. I told her she's been warned ahead of time. She complained that she could not sleep because of all the noise and I thought that was incredibly rude when it is not her house.

It was a three day weekend and Saturday afternoon she really pissed me off. She told my wife it is disgusting that she kissed her friend on the lips (Brian wasn't there) just to entertain some pig men and that she should have more self respect. I told her to get out of my house, and no one is going to shame my wife. Anna started to cry, because I guess she has issues with being yelled at. Brian says we should have toned things down for Anna, but I gave them both plenty of warning. So am I the asshole?",Asshole
AITA for telling my friend crop tops don’t suit her?,"My friend recently lost 100 pounds, a mile stone she’s been looking forward to for a long time after an extended bout with illness that precluded weight loss. 

She’s as excited as I’ve ever seen her about anything and the day she passed the 100 milestone she went out and bought a lot of crop tops and bikinis and started posting lots of #TransformationTuesday photos and was very excited. 

The thing is, she’s still not actually thin. She’s still a size 12 or 14, and her skin is very rough and discoloured from the rapid weight gain and subsequent loss. People are really liking her photos more out of pity than excitement for her. 

The 100 pounds was an arbitrary place marker. She hadn’t really earned the ability to wear that style of clothing. If I were posting photos in clothes that really didn’t suit me, and I had no idea, I’d want a friend to do the hard thing and tell me. So I let her know these things actually still didn’t look good on her (but that there are plenty of clothes do that do.) 

She was really upset and asked what I meant and I said it was awesome she’d lost a lot of weight but until she lost a lot more she should still cover up so there weren’t photos floating around she’d regret later, and she should be proud of her scars her in private, but it’s not something other people necessarily want to see, so she should post pretty pictures of herself. 

I didn’t relish in telling her that, but, again, if the tables were turned I would want someone to tell me because it was just getting embarrassing. But our other friends are really mad at me and saying I had no right to comment if she didn’t ask me for my opinion.

I think they were being bad friends by letting her live in that delusion, because eventually she would realize she was dressing thin when she wasn’t thin. I thought we should be telling one another as friends how to dress most attractively and appropriately for our body types. 

Maybe it is a cultural difference but I don’t understand the logic in pretending she is something she is not and has earned the right to do things she has not, that seems insulting to her more than anything else.  But I also hate seeing her not feel good about herself and her big accomplishment now. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend (23M) CONSTANTLY refers to me as Queen (26F)?,"So help me, God. I never thought I'd have to post here. Throwaway because he knows my Reddit and I don't want him to see this.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. Two months ago, he started jokingly calling me ""Queen"", and over time it's escalated to the point where he constantly refers to me as ""Queen."" For example, when I ask him when/where he wants to eat, whether it be this or that, he always replies with ""Oh! Let's go to X, Queen!"" Or, when I ask a favor of him, he replies with ""Anything for you, my Queen."" At first I thought it was charming and really cute, but it's gotten a little bit annoying over the quarantine period.

For reference, we live together. He moved in with me as I'm the breadwinner in the relationship, a successful programmer in the heart of Silicon Valley. He doesn't work, but he cleans the house, decorates, usually cooks, and will take care of our dogs when I'm not home. Before this, he worked for his dad's company as an architect, but was laid off with Quarantine.

Today I asked if he could go clean the bathroom as it needed to be cleaned, and obviously I didn't want to - it's my day off. He stood up, and bowed, and went ""Yes, my liege."" and then hopped off to go clean.

He does this in public too. I was trying on clothes at a local store, where I stepped out to get his opinion. He loudly said ""Yes, Queen! I love it!"" which caused people to look over at us and cringe in embarrassment.

I blew up on him about this - in public. I shouted at him telling him he needed to grow the f\*ck up and stop calling me queen all the time, how it felt like he put me on a royal pedestal and it was very toxic. I called him an idiot and an asshole but now I feel bad about it. Maybe I was too harsh and he's just trying to have fun with it, and spice up the relationship? Our sex life has been pretty meh lately... Every time he is ready to cum he shouts ""I'm ready to cum queen!"" and that's an instant turnoff for me. He also tends to loudly say ""I'm going to stick it in, Queen!"" so the coochie immediately turns from an ocean to a desert. Impressive stuff, really.

So I blew up on him again - telling him that he was being a serious child and that he needs to grow the f\*ck up, again. He went in our room and locked the door, slipping a note out into the hallway that says, and I quote, ""I'm sorry, Queen."" I've not been in my own bedroom in 2 days because he won't open the door. He comes out to get food and water but that's it, he won't talk to me, or anything.

AITA - Son quits contact because I cancelled his membership in a sports club years ago,"My son graduated from university and recently got a job. I've gotten in some financial trouble so I asked him to help me out a little and he reminded me of the time I cancelled his membership in the sports club (it was more than 10 years ago) and told me to pay it all up myself and to not contact him again.

Some background: More than 10 years ago he was a member in this martial arts school and he enjoyed it. He went there every weekday and took part in tournaments and even got a bunch of medals and trophies. He wanted to become the ""best"". But one day they hiked up the prices. Went from an already ridiculous 30 to 40 bucks a month. I told him I can't pay for it anymore, but he begged and bargained and even offered to give up his pocket money of 10 bucks a month just so he could stay. I told him he can find something else as long as it's cheap, but he never signed up for something else. Just stood home all day long, playing video games, reading and doing whatever. He brought that up twice in the past, such as when I asked him why he just spends all his time at home on the computer and he told me it's my fault for cancelling his membership. He just blamed his own apathy on me? There is so much he could do, there world is full of opportunities, but all he thought about was this one sport when there are hundreds of different sports. Or when I finally saved up enough for a big new TV for all of us, he only uses this as an opportunity to guilt trip me. ""You have enough money for a huge TV but not for my sports?"". His logic eludes me, should we not enjoy life?

I thought that after more than 10 years he would have gotten over it. He didnt bring it up again either until recently. He wasn't much of a talker to begin with, never talked about his day at school, his problems, or really anything. Just spent all his time on his computer, books, chatting with strangers and all that other nerd stuff, always kept everything to himself and never initiated a conversation. He used to go out with his friends but at some point he stopped doing that too, when I asked him he told me they moved to different places. He is always negative, gets irritated easily. I know it's not his fault that he is so easily hurt and only thinks negatively, but how do I fix him? He even blames his depression on me. It's all just so surreal, so many years he kept silent and played nice, only to lash out  like this the moment he moves out? Even though I cooked and cleaned and did everything for him, just because of this one thing?  I would get him to do therapy but how do I force a grown man? I got him into therapy years ago too, but he hated it because it ""interfered"" with his sports. Now that he has his own money, can't he just start doing his sports now? There shouldn't be an issue. I didn't have a choice back then. And now that he would financially be perfectly capable of helping me he doesn't. AITA? Is he? Can I fix him? It's been so long and he is still bitter.",Asshole
WIBTA for cutting my daughter off from financial aid if she changes her name?,"My daughter is currently in her second year of college and has all around been doing great, making me and her father very proud. Because of the insane cost of tuition (almost $40 thousand a year) and the fact that we run a fairly successful car rental business, we agreed that as her parents we'd cover up to three quarters of that, contingent upon her grades, with lower grades earning less aid (roughly equal to $8 thousand per point of GPA). This has worked great for everyone, but now we have a problem. My daughter has a beautiful name both me and her father took great pains to choose well, and it's a lovely mark of our heritage. Unfortunately, apparently basically nobody she knows can pronounce it properly, even after hearing it spoken over and over again. According to my daughter, English just doesn't have some of the sounds the name does, and so English speakers just don't know how to say it. So she wants to change it. To Michelle. **Michelle!**. This makes me furious. We've already had to sully the written form of her name by transcribing it into English lettering (good luck finding any official documentation that allows for non-English letters!), and now she wants to throw it away completely! So I've told her that if she changes her name, our aid deal is null and void. We'll still be her parents, but we won't donate big sums of money to someone so disrespectful. She had a melt down and said all sorts of horrible things, but I think she's just deflecting. Can't we choose how to spend our money?

edit. this was a waste of time. No one understands what this name means, they think a name is just a word or that there's nothing wrong with not caring to learn new things. not sure why I even bothered asking a bunch of racists.",Asshole
AITA FOR EXPOSING MY SIL,"My brother is married to a woman and has a daughter with her. They both are earning well.

I have a daughter and her father is not in the picture. My parents support me. My brother's woman gets free childcare from her parents 2 days a week since she apparently works full time and want to save a bit of childcare fees (165$per day. I told her i can do it for less but she declined).

She wouldn't even let her daughter with my parents (when they apologised for me asking money - who would work for free? Hello!? and offered to do it for free since apparently she's a lovely person. She had everyone twisted around her little finger with her acting) apparently because they are already taking care of my daughter full time and she doesn't want to stress them more. She allows us to visit them at their home which is a freaking 5 bedroom and a study home with a theatre room as well. We live in a 3 bedroom house.

She drops off used clothes from her daughter and unless its my daughter's birthday or christmas she has never ever bought a new dress for her and irrespective of how many dresses she gets new from her parents and sisters and brothers its always used and then shared with us. I was ok with it. I liked certain dresses her daughter was wearing and might have asked her once or twice about when i can pick them up. I dint find anything wrong with it since we are family.

Recently i came to know they have a fund for sending their daughter to private school. I realise how important education is and asked my parents to have a talk with them about sharing it. My parents are very shy and i had to nudge them a bit. They asked and my brother blowed up on them (influenced by his woman). My parents were heartbroken and i thought maybe i can appeal to her parents. Her parents spoke nicely to me even though they said they cant interfere in their daughters life (thats how arrogant she is). 

My brother's woman came to know about this and called me and was very rude and downright nasty. I was trembling after the phone call and my anxiety hit sky high. I asked my parents if they can give me some privacy and stop my brother and his family from visiting them. They said ok because that's what families do... Support the vulnerable. My brothers woman took this as an insult (!!) And forbid my parents to visit their house. My parents are sad since my father really respects her and loves his first born son. I also came to know she posted in this forum yesterday saying nasty things about me and people agreeing with her because she painted herself as victim. AITA if i showed that to my parents and brother to show her true colours?

EDIT: ITS VERY CLEAR YOU ARE ALL SHEEPS. YOU CAN NEVER JUDGE ANYONE BY THEIR SINGLE POST. JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WRITE NICELY DOESN'T MEAN I AM MEAN. MY PARENTS ARE SUPPORTING ME. THATS WHAT PARENTS ARE FOR. TO SUPPORT THEIR KIDS WHEN THEY ARE DOWN. WHO HAS NEVER GOTTEN HELP FROM THEIR PARENTS THROW STONES AT ME.",Asshole
AITA or is my friend the asshole for hating me because of my childhood abuse?,"I'm 14. She's 15. 

&#x200B;

We're both abused. Emily only got a few slaps and punches from her MOTHER whenever she made mistakes, and I was the victim of my father getting drunk and verbally abusing me from ages 2-6. It has affected me greatly and I now have trust issues and anxiety and depression. She doesn't seem to be affected.   


We were close friends, and one day she confided in me about her abuse, so I did the same. I assumed then she would understand my day to day issues because she's abused too, so I started coming to her with my issues. I have trust issues, so it's a bit hard to convince me of something when i'm really sad...I always assume they're lying. And I told her that. She should respect it. It usually takes a few hours to calm me down and talk me out of suicide or self harm...but it should be worth it, yknow? A true friend would care. That's why when she doesn't reply to me I assume she hates me and I call her out on it. I don't want fake friends. 

&#x200B;

I don't like bothering people with my emotions, yknow? So usually I just tell my friends I'm sad or upset when we're in the middle of an activity and I start feeling self-hatred because I fucked up somewhere. I just leave so they don't have to deal with me... and she cheers me up. That's why I feel really hurt when she doesn't even bother and doesn't follow up with me in a few minutes, and I let her know so she doesn't do it in the future.  One day she started CRYING instead, straight to her friend. He got really mad at me for NO REASON? And told me how I wasn't trying to improve myself even though I WAS TRYING. I can't help it, I have severe mental issues from my abuse and they should understand. I called her crying and told her he called me an ATTENTION W\*\*\*\* because he basically did and he reminded me of my father, yelling at me.  I needed her to reassure me and she FAILED ME. Instead, she told me \*\*I HURT HER\*\* for some reason and told me it was STRESSFUL and affecting her mental health NEGATIVELY to try to cheer me up so much ""when you just accuse me of lying instead and make me prove to you I'm your friend"". A good friend will SUPPORT their friend in ANY WAY THEY CAN. It shouldn't affect anyone negatively. I told her that she and him were reminding me of my father, and that I was hurt she didn't even understand how I felt even thought she should have because she's abused, too. NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR ANY SYMPATHY. I told her that her saying that made me cut myself, and that her abuse obviously isn't as bad as mine cause she doesn't seem to have any problems with it and she's asian anyways and all asian parents are like that and she should suck it up and she called me abusive.

&#x200B;

We made up a few days later and she was really distant for some reason. She kept spending time with the guy who attacked me and because of my trust issues and because I recently had two other friends talk about me behind my back before I met her so obviously I would be suspicious. I asked her if she hated me, because she spent time with him instead of me and didn't invite me. She just said she thought I hated him and I DO, I told her I wouldve sucked it up and SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. She stopped spending time with him as much once they got busy with school but she was still distant. I started worrying she was talking about me behind my back, and that she hated me, so i would ask her about it alot, I can't help it, my anxiety makes me worry about it alot, she shoulda just sucked it up and reassured me. 

&#x200B;

Instead, she told me it was rude and told me that it hurt her??? She said it made her feel like I didn't trust her and that friendship was based in trust. I told her the truth, because I hate lies and I'd want people to tell ME the truth. I told her that I obviously didn't trust her, I don't trust anyone because of my abuse, you could put the most trustworthy person in front of me and I wouldn't trust them. She told me to find a therapist and I got a bit mad because she assumed I did nothing about my problems and I told her it was rude of her to assume I did nothing about my mental health and how I cut myself and tried to commit suicide a while ago and I can't even go to school so she SHOULDNT ASSUME THINGS ABOUT ME. She blocked me. BLOCKED ME! She didn't even talk things out like a normal person. She just blocked me without letting me respond or have a say and all she said was that she tried but she just ""can't"" and that I was bad for HER mental health and called me manipulative and claimed I ""flipped"" the situation. It hurt me alot, she was the onl;y person I could rely on to talk to my problems about. I asked my other friends crying if they thought I was manipulative and mean and abusive and someone that everyone hates and they said no so she was wrong. I cut myself.

&#x200B;

Last weekend I bumped into her by coincidence at the mall when she was out with friends and I begged her to give me a second chance and I even had my friend tell her how she made me cry and cut myself and that I was really sorry. I told her I missed her friendship and she said ""me too I guess."" She finally agreed to give me a chance. We decided to discuss boundaries and she told me that as long as I didn't ""flip things or be manipulative"" then she'd be my friend.  I told her how she was mean because she blocked me without telling me why, making me cut and her friendship was toxic to me so i didn't want to be best friends anymore just someone I talked to about my problems and that I felt awful in a way I never wanted to feel when i was friends with her because she called me manipulative and because her girlfriend who was my other best friend before she ghosted me after me and Sally's first fight would always talk to me about her mental problems and threaten to cut herself and kill herself and I'd have to talk her out of it. I also told her my friends didn't think I was manipulative either so she was toxic and I'd appreciate if she didn't talk to me outside of group activities or when I needed her because even seeing her at that mall made me run to the bathroom and cut myself and cry while my friend talked to her. She was super nice at the time too and agreed. Sometimes she brought up some of my behaviour and I told her that I'm not perfect, because I'm not. Plus, it was really confusing to have her go ""I miss your friendship!"" to ""Don't talk to me about personal issues!"" and I told her that she was misleading me by doing so and to please stop. I told her since my friends dont find me manipulative and she did it was super toxic to me and that I understood if she wanted to continue believing it she didn't have to talk to me. We agreed we'd be casual friends who spent time together in groups and helped me with personal issues and nothing more, then parted ways at the mall.

&#x200B;

She got really mad at me later and gave me a list of BULLSHIT reasons cause I told her how upset I was when she didnt tell me why she blocked me. She called me manipulative and a hypocrite for telling her about her girlfriends toxic behaviour to me and told me that I shouldn't talk to her ever again. She didn't even let me reply. I found it really demeaning because some of the things she mentioned I can't help because of my abuse and my problems stemming from it and she told me that she has the same problems, she just doesn't tell anyone. I think she just said that to seek attention and make me feel bad. Who's in the wrong? ",Asshole
AITA for outing my sister as gay and ruining her life,"Throwaway title sounds bad but here me out

High I am a 16 year old boy and have an 18 year old sister. Last year my mom got a tv for my room due to my grades. My sister tries to use but I put a lock on the door as I don't like it. A few times she broke into my room and used it so I put a camera.

Yesterday my parents went out for a drive and let me and my sister stay at home alone. We also have a younger brother 10 who hogs my downstairs tv. My sister kicked me out of my room and locked the door and invited her girlfriend over it.

Apparently they had sex in there as well. I tried explaining it to my mom and my younger brother told mom that someone bought a random person in to the house and scared him. My sister blamed it on me and got me grounded it.

Remember how I said that I had a camera in my room. Last night during dinner I brought the camera and showed the video recording to my mom showing my sister having sex with her girlfriend in my room watching my room for proof that my sister was lying and showing how she broke boundary.

I know my mom can barely tolerate gays but I can't stand my sister anymore with the way she behaves to . My mom told my sister that night she is packing her stuff and is out of the house this morning or she is calling the cops. Today around this time my sister left and called me an asshole for outing her and ruining her life.

edit cps was called because of my sister and my neighbors had to intervene because of what my sister did to me.  My sister and her friends vandalized my parents house blamed it one me and go me grounded for three months. The tv in my room I had I paid half of it. When my sister was in my room she destroyed my things and cut my clothes. My sister scares the crap out of me",Not the A-hole
AITA for locking my son out of his xbox,"Some background info, I (57M) and my ex wife we will call Lisa (49F) have two kids, one we will call Jane (21F) and the other Max (16M). (Also sorry about formatting or grammar, I’m on mobile. 

Anyways, the regular schedule for Max is that he gets 4 days a month with Lisa, while I get the other 26, but recently he has been spending 2 weeks at Lisa’s house and 2 weeks at my house, I’m not happy with this since I’m supposed to have 26 days a month but I put that aside. Another thing is that Max loves video games, he only has one friend in real life and they can’t hang out in person due to Covid-19, so instead he plays with his friends online. He calls his online friends his best friends but I told him that he needs to have real friends and not spend so much time online. I have set a strict limit of 4 hours total screen time for him, that includes everything from gaming to quickly looking something up, this is incredibly generous as doctors say only 1 hour online per day. Anyway recently he was over at Lisa’s house where he doesn’t have his friend and he told me that he wanted to stay for one more day, this made me very upset but I said ok because I knew I could punish him for it, since he created his first Xbox account when he was 8, the email is my email, even though he pays for the subscription, and since the email is mine, it’s my account and have control over. So I changed the password and locked him out, he has called me 32 times but I’m not going to answer so that I can teach him a lesson. 
Lisa and Jane have texted me saying that what I’m doing is wrong and mean, and that Max doesn’t have anything to do and that he is having a “mental breakdown” since he is cutoff from all his friends, but mental breakdowns don’t come that easily.

AITA for giving my sister my girlfriend's necklace and getting mad when she demanded it back?,"I have a girlfriend who I've dated for like 3 years now. She has this gold locket that she's had since she was like 9. It's from this disney series and it's in the shape of a heart with a keyhole sort of shape. It's a nice locket, and it's pretty unique too. But to me, it's just a necklace. My girlfriend hasn't been wearing it for awhile now because she said she needed to get gold chain for it. I told her she already has a chain. But she apparently can't wear it because it's made of silver, and she's ""allergic"" to silver. I don't know how anyone can be allergic to silver, since it's in a lot of things. So she's been planning on getting a gold chain, which in my opinion, is a waste of money. The locket itself is made of actual gold, so why waste more on it.

So she hasn't been wearing it. And my sister visited us. I've been worried about her, to show I still care for her health and such, I gave her my girlfriend's locket as a gift. My sister loved it, and she's not allergic to silver and thought it was cute.

When my girlfriend came home, she ended up finding out I gave away her lock. She demanded I go retrieve her locket. I said no, and she decided to go get the locket back from my sister. My sister called me crying, telling me my girlfriend stole the locket from her. I told my girlfriend she should give the necklace back. My girlfriend told me to f right off and said the necklace was special. I told her it's just a necklace, she can buy a new one if she wants. She said it's the only one like this. And that this necklace holds a lot of meaning to her. I told her that makes no sense, since it's just from a disney game with mickey mouse and other characters. She blew up on me and called me an f-ing thief. I told her we're a couple, her stuff is my stuff also. She threatened to sell my stuff if I ever touched her necklace or anything ever again. I told her she's over reacting, that the necklace is better suit for a child since it's so childish to get mad over a necklace. She refuses to talk to me now, and I don't plan on apologizing for giving my sister a gift.

AITA for putting MIL in time out after she refused to babysit?,"Now I know no one owes me anything but in my world family helps family and she hasn’t seen her grandkids since March. My MIL has a pretty incredible life. She was a trust fund baby and FIL is independently successful so they have a lot of money and freedom. My husband didn’t get anything at the age his sister did because he wasn’t obeying them and they use their money as control.

When the pandemic hit in March they took off with a group of friends and since then they have been rotating between each other’s vacation houses, avoiding the pandemic, and pretty much just partying 24/7. They returned a few days ago from five months of that.

I asked MIL to babysit so my husband and I could go out on our anniversary. We’ve been working from home with two little ones and really struggling to stay afloat. MIL said she couldn’t do it the night of our anniversary because she has to go to her friends birthday dinner, one of the friends she just spent five months with.

Now we are very different people and I get that I’ll never understand her or why friendship is so important or how she can pretty much turn her back on family but I was pissed. I said it’s odd that she needs to see her friend again when she hasn’t seen my kids in months. MIL just shrugged and said it was her birthday.

I put her in time out meaning we’re going very low contact for a little while. My husband supports that and he’s pissed at her but MIL says I am punishing her for not babysitting when  I’m not entitled to babysitting.

"AITA for breaking off a friendship because I think she was faking her ""illnesses""?","I recently broke off a friendship with a girl I'd known since kindergarden because I really think she was faking these illnesses she was claiming to have. She is always on crutches and wearing braces cause she says her joints ""dislocate"" and she even used a wheelchair sometimes. I think she just likes the attention because people are always asking her what happened and helping her. I have always been at least polite, but now it's just ridiculous.

She says she can't even stand for 5 minutes without passing out and that she gets allergic reactions to stuff like my perfume. (she asked me not to spray it around her, but I know she was being over dramatic when she ""had to use an epipen"" because i sprayed one little squirt)

She misses so much school and can never do anything with our friend group anymore, so our other friends go to her house, but I just want to go to the mall, is that so wrong???

One day before walking to class she asked me to carry her backpack for her even though she wasn't even using crutches that day so I said no. (I'd usually say no anyway because I know she's fully capable of carrying it herself) And she just said please because her shoulders were ""dislocating"" a lot that day and I told her to quit her bullshirt because that isn't even possible. I told her that unless she stops faking all of these problems I am so done with our friendship and she just sat their crying asking what she did wrong. I told her that I want a friend who will actually go places with me and be at school all the time for me to talk to and stuff. Then I walked away and I haven't talked to her since.

AITA for telling my daughter that she looks like a prostitute?,"My daughter (18f) is in her senior year of high school and I'm not liking the way she dresses. She likes to wear crop tops, shorts, off the shoulder tops, tube tops, ripped jeans, little dresses, etc. Her entire chest is always on display for the world to see.

today we were going to the grocery store to get some food for a holiday party my family is hosting tonight and she comes down in a cropped tube top, jacket over it and ripped jeans. Just to go to the grocery store? I told her to go change and that it was inappropriate and she got a bit of an attitude but went and changed. On the drive to the store I jokingly told her that Im glad she changed because I wouldnt want men approaching her on the sidewalk for her services. My wife was livid and screamed at me telling I cant say stuff like that. My daughter was crying.

Then we got home and things sort of calmed down even though my wife wasnt really talking to me. Then comes the holiday party. My daughters outfit for the holiday party was ripped jeans and a short sweater that kind of exposed her stomach if she lifted her arms or moved a certain way. I was pissed and pulled her aside and told her there wouldn't be any clients tonight for her so to go change. This turned into a screaming match and my daughter left to go to a friends house and hasn't come home since. My wife is ignoring me and except to put on an act of a united front during the holiday party.

I can see how I can come across as harsh but there's only so much you can do when a child doesn't listen. I asked her nicely so many times in the past to dress better but she doesn't listen. I grew up with tough love and me and all my siblings have a good head on our shoulders as a result so I feel like even if she's mad at me she'll realize I only did it for her benefit. My wife however disagrees with me completely. Who is right. AITA?

**Update: my wife has been in contact with the girl this whole time and been telling her that she should just stay with her friend tonight. This led to a huge fight between me and my wife and she's sleeping in the basement now.

AITA for telling my sister that there’s nothing special about her?,"I (21M) have two sisters. My older sister (23) and I were very gifted as children, and are both very intelligent. I’m currently studying to be an architect and my older sister to be a lawyer. We both speak several languages and always got good grades in school. 

My younger sister (17) is different. She’s just ordinary, and I feel bad for her because my parents were always very proud of me and my older sister, but never passed up an opportunity to remind my youngest sister what a disappointment she was compared to us. Admittedly, the two of us weren’t super nice to her growing up either, but I’m trying now. 

It’s hard though — I can tell she still resents me even though I feel like she owes it to me to forgive me now that I’m trying to be nicer. Besides, we were kids who didn’t know any better. My parents are on a trip, and asked me to stay and watch her because they don’t trust her to be alone in the house. 

She’s been avoiding conversation with me as much as possible, and it’s been annoying because I want to connect with her. I finally confronted her about it today and asked her why she’s been avoiding me, and she said “I don’t owe you anything. Leave me alone”. I asked her what she meant, and she said “mom and dad have always treated me like a talentless loser, and you and sissy always always joined in”. I was really agitated, and said “oh please, we were just kids. You really need to get over yourself and move on”. She responded with “move on? Go fuck yourself. I’m sorry that I was never enough for any of you, even with my own talents that you all shat all over”. 

What I said next, I admit, may have been harsh. I was just angry that she was talking to me this way, and said “what fucking talents? You know why mom and dad always treated you like a talentless loser? Because there’s nothing special about you at all”. I regretted it immediately after saying it, because now she won’t come out of her room and I can hear her crying. 

I know what I said was bad but I feel like she really needs to get over it. It’s not like she was abused, she’s just not like us, and she has to understand that most people have no special skills like me or my older sister. And the way she was talking to me really hurt my feelings, because I’m trying to reach out to her and she’s shooting down all my attempts.

Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to ""on"" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.

&#x200B;

Additional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  


To complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?

&#x200B;

(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been ""See? The alert worked.""  :|  )

Am I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?

AITA for getting my new daughter a way better gift than my two previous step son last Christmas?,"I am a 45 year old mom who had two 14 year old boys in my last marriage. I have a 12 year old daughter now in my new marriage. Last Christmas I gave my daughter a mac pro and a used iPhone 8. I gave my two kids some joy con controllers and a game. When they saw my daughter open her Christmas presents they where both furious and refuse to talk to me. They have an old 2008 laptop and an old 2009 computer. 

There dad gave them an upgrade to both 2016 computers. Anyway this is where the issue comes anytime we go to a family dinner a theme park etc they ruin the mood. They tell me oh are you going to give your daughter more food is she going to be a fat ass now. Then we went to a theme park. They said something to me in a passive aggressive way that oh is your daughter going to get first pick hopefully she does not develop a fear of heights. My sons rarely ever talk to me now any more. Sometimes they refuse to go to my are for a custody arrangement. AITA",Asshole
AITA for ruining a girl's reputation to save mine?,"This happened pre rona.

I come from an Indian family that's pretty stereotypically conservative and strict-- no dating, no drinking or drugs, always maintain a 4.0. I mostly stuck to these rules because I figured they would help me stay on their good side (which helps when I want stuff like new clothes or a car) and achieve my goals, but I don't think there's anything objectively wrong with dating, doing drugs or drinking, or having bad grades.

Anyways, I was running for a club presidency, and my opponent was just as qualified as me, so I decided to throw a huge party to get more support-- this isn't really against the rules, because there weren't any concrete rules as to what to do or not do. To make it a good party, obviously I needed lots of beer, so I got lots of beer. The party was a success, and I won.

There's this girl I know, also Indian, who goes to my school, Neha. She knows me pretty well due to the fact her parents and my parents are friends. She's always hated me. Why? Idk, I never did anything to her. She's just needlessly cruel.

Anyhow, news of the party somehow got to her, and she basically came up to me and gloated she was going to tell my parents I threw a huge party with drinking (stupid move). I told her she shouldn't do that, because I would ruin her rep to save mine. She didn't listen and told my parents anyways, so I spread rumors (that were true) with the Indian community through friends that she was really into drugs and thus couldn't be trusted. This was so her accusations would no longer be taken seriously. My parents stopped taking what she said seriously, and I was safe.

She was pissed at me for this, because her parents were now pissed at her. I think it's ironic-- she was willing to make my parents pissed at me for *no reason.* I told her it was a bad idea, but she did it anyways, forcing my hand-- I feel bad I had to ruin her rep, but I did it out of self-preservation because of the thing *she did.* And now she has the audacity to be angry at me for doing the exact thing she did to me, except I did it to save myself instead of for no reason like her? I don't think I'm TA because I was just reacting to a situation in a way that helped me survive, unlike her, since she did it out of spite.",Asshole
AITA for talking to my sister’s bf without her permission?,"So my (19f) sister (21f) recently got a bf (22m) and they been together for idk how long exactly. She’s so secretive about him and barely talks about him nor does she let me talk to him. Everytime they hang out, he picks her up and she runs out the door without telling our family where she’s going or who she’s with. I just wanna get to know the guy my sister is dating.

Multiple times while I caught her on the phone with him, I would tell her to put it on speaker or to give me her phone so I could talk to him and she said he wasn’t ready to talk to me yet and only wanted to meet my parents rn.

Two days ago, my sister went to meet her bf’s parents. While she was there, I called her and asked her to talk to him and his mom. She said I could then hung up. I texted her, asking why she hung up and she said I can’t talk to people I don’t know. I told her I just wanna be supportive and get to know her bf and bf’s family and to let me talk to her bf. Then I asked why she won’t let me talk to him. She told me that I can’t talk to him on the phone and I gotta wait until dad meets him in person. Then she called me nosy and a busy body. And she called me an annoying little sister and that the more I “harass” her, the longer it will be until I can meet him.

Then she said that I’m not her parent and I can’t demand to see her bf. Mom already met him a few weeks back, but dad said he doesn’t wanna meet him until they’ve been together for six months and my sister said I would have to wait until then. This fucking pissed me off. And I told her that if I wanna meet someone I will and she’s not my parent so she can’t stop me from meeting her bf. I didn’t like her tone so I told her that she better act right when she talks to me. I refuse to let her talk to me any way she wants.

So I sat in our driveway until my sister came home. I had to wait for two hours but they finally showed up close to mid night. When he parked in front of the driveway I ran in front of the car to prevent him from driving off and stood at his driver’s window. He took forever to wind down his window even after I said hi and when he did wind it down, it was only a little bit. 

I secretly recorded our conversation. I introduced myself and I asked him what did they do, who did they meet, and where did they go. He seemed scared of me so clearly my sister told him something to make him feel that way. She wants to claim he thought I was “a nice girl” from stuff she told him about in the past but if he thought I was nice he shouldn’t have acted like a pussy when I talked to him.

Edit: ok I think it’s important that people understand that my sister is super naïve. She doesn’t understand things literally every other adult understands. She was clearly sheltered too badly and now she’s vulnerable to creeps who might take advantage of her",Asshole
AITA for taking my GF's kid's airpods?,"So recently I had the pleasure of meeting my girlfriend's daughter who is 14 (let's call her H), but she seems to listen to music a lot as she has her airpods in all the time - sometimes even at the dinner table. At one point I decided to sit down and talk with H about how that kind of behavior can be a bit disrespectful, etc, but she still had them in while pretending to listen to me. I got a bit frustrated and took them off so she could listen to me. For some reason, H started panicking and called for her mom, who yelled at me saying ""Why would you do that? She needs those!"" I tried to talk to H, but she wouldn't respond, she just kept panicking. I don't understand why they're making such a big deal, as they're just airpods.

AITA for wanting my son to have equal treatment to his brother/cousins?,"My (27f) younger sister(20f) likes to dye her hair a lot. She's had every color of the rainbow, done split dye and multiple colors at once.

A few weeks ago she decided to dye it again and told all the kids in the house they could put it on her hair if they were good. Of course they all wanted to. 

When the day finally came my older son had a fit about sharing toys and isolated himself until he calmed down. My sister asked him if he still wanted to help 'paint' her hair but because he was upset he said no. I will admit she asked a couple mores and he said no each time - but he was obviously not in the best mood so of course he said no.

In the end the others kids got to do her hair and by the time she had washed off my son wanted to do it too.

I told her that she could;ve waited until he was feeling better but she blew me off. I asked her to let him do her hair next time she dyed it and she said she'll think about it, but she said it in a way that obviously meant she wasn't going to.

AITA for expecting FIL to clean up what I threw?,"My husband's dad came to visit recently with his new wife. They really aren't my type of people. He is the typical middle aged rich guy with a sport's car and a much younger wife, and she is super materialistically and annoying. We just live very different lifestyles.

I am vegan and I don't allow any meat in my household. I prefer them not to bring dairy in, but I will look the other way. They have been kind of annoying house guests, but I've bit my tongue on a lot of things (inappropriate jokes, he plays rougher with the kids than I like, she doesn't clean up after herself) but yesterday after dinner I went outside and they were in the yard eating a rotisserie chicken.

I felt so angry and disrespected. I yelled at both of them and they just got giggly like teenagers. I picked the chicken up and threw it. My husband came out and tried to diffuse things. I told FIL he should clean up the mess because he brought that into my house and disrespected me.

AITA for calling my mtf (ex) best friend a “man in a wig” because of my OCD?,"This happened in 2017. (F) I was 18. I had a friend and for this story I will call her Amy. Amy is trans (mtf, 18)

I have nothing against trans people. In 2017 I had a really hard time mentally. I struggled with POCD, OCD, anxiety and depression.

Amy and I were at my aunts. And we were best friends for over a year at this point and she was explaining to me how she tucked. I knew all of this about Amy within the first couple months of knowing her and I had even seen her naked and it didn’t bother me. I loved her.

This day somehow my mind snapped and I thought about how she had a penis. For the next 3 hours I felt sick to my stomach and I needed to talk to her about it because my head told me if I didn’t then we would all die. I was scared, my stomach hurt and I couldn’t relax. She knew something was up. I was so mad at myself because I was accepting of her why was this on my mind?

I started feeling panicky and I decided we were best friends maybe I could talk to her. I asked her if we could talk and she said yeah and sat beside me. I told her I need to talk to her but I don’t want to hurt her feelings. She agreed to listen. I tried to explain to her how I felt and how I didn’t know why I felt that way. I felt panicky and I told her it was like she was a man in a wig and I cried. She was hesitant to talk and I knew it upset her. we talked some more, had some ice cream together and I thought things were okay. I thought it was somewhat okay to talk to her about it because she was almost my diary and would help me calm down. 

Things seemed normal for the next two weeks but then she started distancing from me. She would ignore my texts when I knew she was on. I asked her what was wrong and she acted like we were good. And then right after she would ignore me again. So I begged her to talk to me and that if I did something wrong please let me try to fix it and that I’m sorry. It had been about a month with her not talking to me and I saw her at my therapists place. She was walking in as I was by the car. I looked at Amy wondering if I should say anything. Would it be best for her if I left her alone? I wondered. I got in the car and left.

She later brought up something like “why didn’t you say anything at the therapists? (Eye roll emoji)” and I explained and begged her to talk it out, but no.
A week or so went by she texted my bf why she wouldn’t talk to me then blocked us both. My bf sent the chat she said something like “since I’m just a man in a wig, I’ll go”. Then it hit me. I remembered that I said that to her I felt so bad I wanted to apologize to her but there was nothing I could do she didn’t want to talk she wouldn’t hear me out when I begged her to talk to me. 

Years later I think I should of kept it to myself back then to save her unnecessary pain, but I didn’t know how to handle my OCD. I know she felt like I betrayed her.

AITA for not being my daughter's plaything and refusing to just jump at her beck and call whenever she feels like it?,"When my youngest daughter came out to me as a gay, I was devastated. I felt like a failure, like I had done something wrong. I felt like God was punishing me for my self-righteousness and my hypocrisy. My two older daughters were straight and married to two nice, young, wonderful men and I would shake my head with pity when I heard how another family broken apart because a family member had come out as a gay. I had no problem with gays, I just didn't want *my* daughter to be one. Hypocrite smh.

My daughter came out to me at 16. At first I tried to pray the gay away. Then I tried to pretend the gay away. I hoped it was just a phase she would eventually get over if I just didn't acknowledge it. Needless to say, our relationship was very strained for those 2 years until she turned 18 and went away to college.

After my daughter was out the house, I was able to sit down and reflect. I decided that, gay or not, that was my daughter, who I loved and wanted to have a relationship with.

A girl in our neighborhood was kicked out in her senior year, and stayed with us temporarily until she graduated. Because she wasn't my blood daughter, her homosexuality didn't feel like an attack to me, and I was able to learn to appreciate her as she was, sexuality and all. 

I gave her my permission to spread the word and over the years abandoned gay teens would drop by for a quick place to sleep, eat, or shower. Seeing their struggles and hearing the horrific stories of what they went through, made my heart ache for them and for my daughter.

But she wouldn't speak for me, only to my husband. For 9 years I tried. Email. Text. Calls. Gifts. Reasurring her that I loved her and that I had changed. I would've kept trying till this day, but then she invited my husband to her wedding and not to me.

I broke. In desperation, I *begged* her to let me attend, even if just sit in the back. How could a mother their daughter's special day? 

She stone-walled me. My husband even tried to reason with her, no go. He even said to me that he wouldn't go because he saw how devastated I was, but I said, ""No. Go."" Even on the wedding day, I tried to sneak in, just to get a glimpse, or at least *one* picture, but she personally had security there to bar me.

I was done. Don't tell me love is unconditional, because it's not. I think I actually hated my daughter then, and over time I eventually became indifferent. 

Fortunately, many of the gay teens I helped remembered me and I've been to plenty of their weddings since then. 

Recently, my daughter apologized. Now she's trying to invite me to her one-year anniversary, but I told her I'm not going. Frankly, I don't think it's authentic. I think she just saw pictures of me at other weddings and heard about what I've been doing in the community, and she feels jealous.

Even if it's not jealousy, I tried for 9 years to reconnect with her. I need a rest. I don't want to see/ talk to her again until I'm ready. Maybe never again.

We just dropped the groceries by the front door and walked out, and then texted my daughter about how disrespectful that was and how she should always be wearing a shirt even if she got some stupid surgery.

AITA? He's freaked out but I'm not a stalker," ""Met"" a guy on \[insert dating app\]. Talked in app a bit then moved the conversation to text. The overall extent of the contact was about two days.

Throughout the texts (which opened with some very, very interesting jokes about catfishing -- right off the bat), we get:

* Him, casually informing of the city he works in and exactly what make of cars he sells.
* I jokingly said, ""Creepy, huh?"" about something not actually creepy. His response was ""Nah, not until you start telling me what I'm wearing."" I advised, ""challenge not accepted. I'm done being super creepy today \[laughing emojis, duh\].""
* He returns: ""Oh no, creep on.""
* He asks where I'm located(ish). My info is vague. He offers his: across the street from a well-known landmark.
* I make further bizarre jokes about being creepy by my own self. I said, ""that's a level of creepy I will stay away from for now. Out of respect for your innocence"" ... some dumb joke about a 'creeping algorithm', #notstalking... Very laissez faire.
* Again, back and forth with the tongue-in-cheek thing on 'creepy.' I guess what he's wearing (because he'd said he'd taken his shirt off... half assumption/half knowing dudes... idk... who fucking cares?) I'd again said I ""didn't want to sound creepy.""
* He asks what I drive (he sells cars, so, whatever.) I tell him. He says he's okay with \[make of car\] and is ""required to endorse them. Stalk away."" << this invitation is attached to what I guess is a photo of his actual vehicle, street parked, license plates not readable. The make of his car is the same as mine.
* There's a running joke/poke at how shitty my phone camera is. I advised I dropped it face down on concrete, but it had been shitty previously, anyway. He tells about how he smashed his last phone the day before he was supposed to turn it in/upgrade, and how it helped that his work cameras caught it, to substantiate his claim. Unsolicited, I receive a video (from behind the desk, pointed at a monitor showing the security feed in the parking lot). He says:  

   * ""You can definitely stalk me now."" and
   * ""And stalking based on that video just requires putting two words together.""

I'd thought that he... wanted me to track him down? IDFK. I even TOLD him, in a lighthearted way: ""I figured out your trail of crumbs, btw. \[sunglasses emoji\]. The video helped 0%"" (lol....??)

The next day, I swung by dealership and  handed a passing salesman a 'thank you note' for \[this dude\] and asked if he could drop it on his desk.

I was POSITIVE that I was going to get some kind of text, like, ""haha!"" or some shit. Instead he was dead quiet. I wasn't sure he'd gotten the note (that, idk fuck me, but I think it was pretty obvious who that'd have been from??). He responds by saying today was 'weird' but wouldn't explain. Like pulling teeth, I said... ""if you got a random note: it was me..."" (My eyes are rolling so hard even thinking about it.) He is CONSPIRACY-LEVEL WEIRD and freaked out.

Now recently my mom(age40) got pregnant and i didn't like it because i don't think i need another sibling and my 2 other siblings have been nothing but a pain in my ass and having another sibling means that we are going to spend a lot of money on doctors and when the baby is born we are going to keep spending more money on diapers and all that baby stuff and i think that they don't need anymore children and if the baby is born a boy i would mandatorily go to the military and i don't want that.

AITA for choosing to hire a man over an 'equally qualified' woman?,"I work in an extremely niche field (there are honestly only a couple of dozen people in my country qualified to do what I do) both freelance and, more importantly, as a partner in an independent firm.

I have an apprentice for my freelance work (my cousin, he wants to get into the industry and without hands-on experience from someone qualified and respected it is so close to impossible as to make no difference) but I tend to work alone when working with the firm. This has had to change recently. After a huge downturn in business due to the rona, we are now back in business and people are looking to 'pick up the slack' as it were and we are SLAMMED. Which is awesome as we were worried we may have to close our doors but it also means I have so much work to do now (I am the only one in the firm who does it, kinda why they hired me) and it would be impossible/heart-attack inducing to do so alone -  I need an assistant/apprentice.

Thanks to recruitment schemes we're even getting some money from the government to register an official apprenticeship (yay) and so we got to recruiting.

We boiled down thousands of applications to a dozen or so that I interviewed over skype then last week we brought in our last 2 candidates for a face to face (socially distant) interview. Here is the rub:

There were 2 great candidates, 1 guy (30) and 1 girl (24). Despite the age gap they were pretty much equally qualified with little to no difference in academic achievement and experience. After the interviews, though, my mind was so easily made up. The guy and I had about 2 hours of fantastic conversation, like I would genuinely get a beer with the guy if I met him out and about randomly, it was a brilliant interview and he is incredibly charming and charismatic. the girl on the other hand was nervous, shy, quiet and very very awkward. I don't hold it against her but I made my decision based on that.

Now it seems a few of the managers and 2 of he partners are pissed - they wanted me to hire the girl. The company is pretty much even in terms of gender but (due in part to physical limitations/necessities) my field is overwhelmingly male pretty much across the board. Their argument is that she does not need to be charming or charismatic to do the role well as it is not so much 'customer facing'. But I would still have to spend sometimes 12hrs a day with this person when working and I would MUCH rather have someone I like/get on with.

AITA For Not Engaging with People Who Expect me to Speak Spanish?,"I (25 f) have lived in Southern CA for all of my life, where there is a huge Spanish-speaking population. I am white as can be (I was born here, my family immigrated from Finland), but I do speak pretty fluent Spanish along with a couple other languages.

When I am out and about, if a person comes up to me and tries asking for directions or help in English, and I realize that they are struggling with the language, I will gladly try to help them in their native language if it is one I speak. Often this means I get to practice my Spanish, Finnish, etc., and they often are very happy/relieved to find someone who they can communicate with.

That being said, I find it really offensive and disrespectful when someone walks up to me and just starts speaking Spanish right away. I'm clearly not Latino, and I don't understand why anyone would think it's okay to do that. I have spent a lot of time in Mexico over the years, but not a single time have I ever approached a stranger down there and spoken English to them right away. If you are in Mexico, you do your best to speak Spanish! If you are in China, you do your best to speak Chinese! If you are in the United States, you do your best to speak English!

That being said, I don't ignore or shake my finger at people who come up to me and automatically expect me to engage with them in Spanish. In these instances, I simply shrug and say something like ""I don't speak Spanish"", or, if they get pushy and rude, I'll tell them ""Lo siento, no hablo espanol, estamos en los estados unidos"" (I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish, we're in the United States).

I'm still not going to help people who come up to me and expect me to automatically accommodate them in a foreign language, before they are even willing to give mine a try. I will also continue trying my best to speak the language of the land when I travel, or if I ever immigrate somewhere in the future. That's what decent, respectful, and well-mannered human beings do.

AITA for changing my mind about saving my sister?,"I used to have an elder sister who excels in everything, the prettiest, smartest and most popular girl in the neighbourhood. My parents adore her and as for me, who wasn't as pretty nor smart, I was a living embarrassment. 


I wasn't mistreated, but felt unloved compared to what my parents provide for my sister, paying for her school, as I was sent into student dorms and struggled with money and loans.


When my sister got married my parents paid for their house too while I worked my ass off paying for necessities. Despite my parents, she cared about me as she tried to invite me to live with her which I declined.


When I heard that my sister urgently needed a kidney, I wanted to help her and I was a match. We had everything arranged and all but I was scared, nobody wanted to lose an organ. Then I heard my parents remarks that I finally got to be useful for once. Losing a kidney of mine doesn't matter at all as long as my sister gets one. Something snapped and my mind was set.


I ran away, ignoring all forms of contact, packed and moved to another city. Later I heard that my sister passed, leaving her devastated husband and son. I finally decided to answer the calls and was greeted with curses from my parents in which, despite knowing that it will hurt them more, I told them that it was them who made me changed my mind.


I told them that had they even spared a single thought for me I would have stayed, but it was their attitude and indifference changed my mind. After that I blocked them off completely and never talked to them again.


I come to realized how selfish I might have been, giving my sister, the one who cared about me, the hope to live and taking it away. What's more, I pushed the blame to my parents. Or was it not a wrong move to keep my own kidney?

AITA for telling my Muslim brother not to pray?,"Obligatory throw away. Me and my family are a common atheist household and my brother 19M recently turned Muslim. My mom was mad and now mostly avoids him. Me 18F and my family have been recently uncomfortable because of my brother praying. It is weird for us and we feel uncomfortable whenever he prays. My family had told him this and asked me to ask him if he could stop praying.

AITA for telling my kid that she just needs to stay off social media and work harder around the house to get a job when she graduates in December 2021?,"My daughter approached my husband and me about taking the fall semester off because she is worried about not securing an internship for Summer 2021, which could convert into a full time offer for when she graduates in December 2021. She proposed that she’d spend all of her time applying to jobs in that time since recruiting is mainly in the fall. 

My husband and I, who pay for her 60% of her tuition (grandparents cover the rest and she has a 60k scholarship), told her that we were not going to do that because she wastes all of her time on social media anyway and because she had already taken a gap year (which pushed her graduation off by a semester). 

She was sort of upset about that but then went into talking about how she couldn’t decide between a career in product management, consulting, and data analytics. She’s done marketing before and said she didn’t want to do it because of the pay. I replied “Yeah, it’s easy so the pay is shit,” which she glared at me for. 

I told her that other people her age, 21, had already decided and knew what they wanted to do. She then retorted, “I don’t think that was a very supportive or helpful comment. I am not other people and I was looking for support and advice from you and Dad. Do you expect me to have something chosen just like them along with 500 related experiences?” I replied, “I wish.”

She was infuriated by my comment and said “Well other 53 year old women have a 3 million dollar house,” as a way to get back at me, and my husband backed me up by saying that sometimes in life people are rude and you just have to get over it. My husband also said, “Well you’re only having trouble deciding because you started late.” 

She wanted to be pre-med at first and then decided she wasn’t committed enough through the hardships and debt. Moreover, she only had a 3.6 science GPA and a 3.8 cumulative GPA. She had a B- in Organic Chem 1 also. 

I ended our conversation by saying, “If you want to get a good paying job out of college, I suggest that you start by being more hardworking. Spend less time socializing with friends online and start helping more around the house. That will give you an attractive work ethic.” 

My daughter and I then fought some more about how economics classes won’t prepare her for a career in business or consulting and then I just told her I needed to go to sleep because I have to put a roof over her head, so AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not flushing the toilet?,"So at the moment I'm living with my son and his fiancée, who I don't like all that much. She cooked dinner last week, and made us spicy chicken wings. I knew at the time they weren't cooked properly and I told her repeatedly during the meal. She argued back(!) and said they were fine. My son took her side and told me I was wrong and rude.

Last night, I had diarrhoea. Really really bad, stomach is still cramping. I am so mad that I was right and am suffering as a result of her actions. To demonstrate the situation, I deliberately did not flush the toilet. I knew she was going to have a shower a few minutes later, so the bathroom would have stank when she went in, and she could not avoid the evidence of what she had done.

This morning, I brought it up at breakfast. ""I'm sure you saw my stomach contents last night, and realize now that you severely injured me by failing to cook responsibly,"" I said, calmly and reasonably. She got very angry and it ended up in an argument where she called me an asshole. But she is living in my house and she could have killed me.

AITA for telling my friend that saying she “hates Mormons” is just as bad as saying the same thing about any other group?,"Note: I understand that “Mormons” prefer other names (I use Latter-day Saints when referring to them), but for the purposes of this post, I will use Mormon when quoting someone. No offense intended.

So I (17F) have a good friend, Elena (17F). She is a nice person, can be a bit overzealous when talking about some things and occasionally awkward, but is overall a cool person to be around. 

She is an atheist, and will tell anyone who asks (and those who don’t). I don’t have a problem with this. Just stating facts. 

Recently, she has been vocal about her hatred about Latter-day Saints (she calls them Mormons). She will bring it up frequently, shouting “oh I hate Mormons!” in the middle of a conversation. She also expresses misinformation, for example, the belief that they practice polygamy still (NOT TRUE). 

I am shy, especially when it comes to standing up to people. This really bothers me, though, so I try. I have told her that she is wrong about the polygamy, and reminded her that many of our close friends and some teachers are Latter-day Saints and also great people. She has not listened. 

Recently, she said it again. So I told her to stop saying that she hates Mormons, and that saying that is just as bad as saying she hates Jews or Muslims. She got really mad about the last comment, argued that it wasn’t the same thing at all, and that being hateful toward people made it okay for others to hate them (I assume she was referring to the rules against homosexuality- she is gay). I haven’t spoken to her since. 

AITA for saying that it’s the same as if she said it about Jews or Muslims (or anyone else)? I thought it was a valid claim- they’re all religious groups- but I’m starting to second guess myself. Any help would be appreciated.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to get down on my knee when proposing to my girlfriend?,"I recently proposed to my girlfriend of three years. We had talked about what she would like when the moment came, and I did everything close to spec with the exception of getting down on one knee. She did accept but then later told me I had to redo my proposal because I didn't propose to her on one knee so it ""didn't count"" and wasn't official. 

There's no reason why I can't get down on my knee. I don't have knee problems. I just find it humiliating to have to act as if I am begging her to marry me. I don't understand why it needs to be done this way. 

I explained this to her and she doesn't understand why I am so resistant to this. She thinks I should just do it since I love her and know it's important to her.

AITA for making jokes about my wife's intelligence,"The other post of this title inspired me to post my version.

My wife and I are trying to conceive and when the topic comes up with friends or family, there's one joke I love to say:

Edit: wife will say something while talking about having kids like I will be the one helping them with homework because God knows she cant (a joke calling herself dumb)

Edit: I then speak up and say something like:
""We better hope the kiddo gets my brains and her looks, otherwise they'll be dumb and ugly.""

It's clearly a self depreciating joke that I'm smart but ugly and she's dumb but beautiful.

_Most_ people find it to be hilarious... her family however, ""can't believe"" I would say something so rude.

Being the troll I am, when they said they were offended by it, I said ""I know, I know, I'm _not_ ugly. That's the joke.""

Yet again, _another_ joke.

Now what's even more hilarious to me is when I take it even further and say ""humor is a sign of intelligence and sorry to say, but your family lacks a sense of a humor.""

Ruthless, I know.

Typing it out, I dunno, I do sound like a huge asshole? But c'mon, am I at least a funny asshole?

Edit: Just showed my wife this and she smiled. She said I just better not say it to her while she's in labor, because there's a real 50/50 chance that kids going to be batshit ugly. 😂😂

Info: Wife is not offended by the joke, thinks it's funny.

Info: Wife wants credit for the setup. She said I should help our future kids with their homework because God knows she can't (a joke about her being dumb). So my follow up builds on it to _also_ self deprecate myself (a joke about how I'm ugly and opposites attract).

AITA for not sleeping on the couch?,"My gf strted a pillow fight the other day & thngs got competitive & I hit her really hard in the face & she strted crying. I *immediately* drpped the pillow, & went 2 hug her, apologizing. She pushed me away & screamed 4 me 2 get out. I felt really bad so I went out & bought her some roses & chocolates.

When I came back, she was still in room & when I tried door, it was locked (we never locked doors on each other b4). I couldve picked the lock easily, but I gave her space & told her tht whn she came out, I had a surprise 4 her.

It gets late, I get sleepy & want 2 go bed. 

I was raised tht u never goto sleep angry, or at least w/out talking abt what made u upset. If u  really ♡ sumbdy, u'll make the effort 2 commnicate, evn if they arent receptive 2 it yet.

Bedroom door is still locked. She opens the door & shoves a pillow & some blankets in my arms. I'm looking at her, like *What the hell?*

She says, ""Have fun on the couch"" *and slams the door in my face*.

Do u know how disrespected I felt as a man? 2 just be *shut out* like tht? Like I was *nothing* -over an *accident*?

I swear I wanted 2 kick that door down.

But I kept my composure & said firmly, ""If I have 2 sleep onthe couch 2night, the relationship is over."" 

She finally opens the door, & walks past me with her own pillow & blankets, & says, ""Fine. Have the bed. Ill sleep on the couch then.""

I was just so fed up w/ all the childishness & the disrespect that I just shrugged & went 2 sleep in the bed & let her sleep onthe couch.

2day when I went dwnstairs, she thru her arms around me & tried 2 kiss me & thnk me 4 the roses & the chocolates. I wasnt in the mood. I told her we would tlk later, but I just needed some space & time 2 thnk over a few thngs, & I went over 2 a frends house.

At my frends house, my phone was off, but she got a call from my gfs sister who strted cursing me out. Aparently, the night b4, my gf had posted about how I let her sleep onthe couch.

I called my gf & she apologzed & put a post up sayng erythng was fine, but the damage was alredy done. The comments were mostly: **""SCREW HIM! HE LET U SLEEP ONTHE COUCH! NO REAL MAN DOES THAT!""**

I stand on wht I did. This isnt a TV show where we force our partners 2 sleep on couches. Our relationship isnt *scripted*.  This is reality. We dont slam doors in each others face like children (even some children have more respect than that). My Dad *never* had 2 sleep onthe couch& neither did my mom b/c no matter how mad they got at each other, they had enough love & respect 4 each other 2 communicate like adults.

Im still at my frends house. I havent gone back yet. Honestly, the most hurtful thng abt this is door slamming in my face & that she would get so mad abt me acidently hitting her 2 hard w/ a pillow & shut me out like tht smh.

Also, its her house. I help pay the bills & handle the cars & repairs, but at the end of the day, its her name on lease, she owns it & can legally evict me if she wnted 2.

AITA for advising my wife to wear less revealing clothing when my son’s friends are over?,"My wife is 48, we have been married for nearly 20 years. We have a 18 year old son, as well as 4 younger kids.

Our son is in his last year of high school. He is a very popular guy and has many friends. His friends often come over to hang out and occasionally to sleep over. Our house is large so they like coming here. 

Last year, my son’s best friend Tom (also 18) came with us on a family vacation at our beach house. During that time I noticed that he would always be staring at my wife and checking her out. Once, he walked in on her changing in a bathroom, and claimed that he “didnt know it was occupied”. He would also say borderline inappropriate comments like “you look lovely today” and “you have to tell me your workout routine”. For this reason I am a bit wary of Tom, in particular.

On Saturday, my son and his 4 friends,including Tom, were over at our house for a sleepover. In the morning, my wife made them breakfast. She was wearing only a silk camisole and shorts. I walked in and noticed that many of the guys were not so subtly “checking her out”. Don’t get me wrong, my wife looks amazing for her age, but it just seemed uncomfortable and awkward for her to be dressed like that in front of her son’s friends.

After breakfast, I mentioned this to her, and told her that she should consider wearing something less revealing next time, or simply just get dressed in her everyday clothes. She said its “no big deal” and that I’m being too overbearing, that “they’re just kids”. I said they’re not just kids, they’re young men, and I’m just looking out for her. Besides, I told her that our son would no doubt agree with me, that he’d prefer it if his friends didn’t check out his mother.

AITA for being indifferent to the fact that I may have a baby in Thailand,"Alright so long story short, I had a night out drinking and taking Xanax at Aonang beach in Krabi, Thailand. After unsuccessfully attempting to locate a Chinese man who was trying to drown himself in the ocean, I ended up blacking out (presumably from the substances I consumed). I eventually woke up alone on the beach at about 3 in the morning. So I’m starting the fairly long walk back to my hostel when a Thai lady, about 30 years old, asks me if I’d like a ride with her on the scooter. I say “yes please, slumber party hostel, you know?” She’s a local and it’s a very popular hostel so of course she knows so I jump on. During the ride itself, I either had my eyes closed or blacked out again (not sure which), and when I come to, we’re outside of her place. I quickly say “noo no, hostel hostel”, to which she then asks me to stay with her for the night. I tell her I have no money or condoms and she says “ noo I want your baby, I want your baby”. I was extremely sexually inexperienced at the time (still now tbh) so any chance I have to get laid I’m down for. So I stayed the night, finished in her twice, then she drove me home the next morning. She did not ask to exchange information, so even if I wanted to, I have no way of contacting her.

I’ve told this story to quite a few people and this one guy shamed the fuck out of me, saying he can’t even look me in the eye anymore, because I could potentially have a baby out there whose life I am not apart of and don’t plan to become apart of. This Thai lady knew what she wanted and didn’t expect anything else of me.

I’d like to think I’m pretty obviously not the asshole, but this guy who shamed me made me question myself. Now this is going to sound maybe a bit assholeish, but if anything, I’d like to think I did her a favor. She was getting older, maybe even mid thirties, really wanted a kid, and what a better prospect than a tall, decently built white guy. I know it’s unlikely, but I actually hope she had the kid cause goddamn did she ever want it.

So AITA for not caring if I have a baby out there in Thailand.

TLDR: Thai lady picked my drunk ass up off the road, took me back to her place without my knowledge, said she wanted my baby, so I agreed and potentially gave her the baby.

AITA for not telling my son that his standards for women are too high?,"My son is 21 and in college. I’ve been working and living overseas for 12 years now and only get to come back about six weeks out of the year. I’ve been back for the holidays. We don’t often get to have quality father-son talk. He doesn’t like to share too much about his private life. We were driving back home from the golf course when I asked him if he likes any women at his college. By his own admission, he only hooked up with one woman a few times. He admits to being really nervous around women. He’s a really shy guy overall. He said he wants a long-term girlfriend though. 


As a father, I told him my story of having many girlfriends by the time I was his age because I always put myself out there. I told my son that he has no reason to be nervous around woman because he is taller and more handsome than I ever was. I then asked him a few questions about what type of women he found attractive. I asked him what race he liked best and was willing to date. He said he liked Caucasians the most, Asians second, Hispanics third, and isn’t looking to date outside of those. Then I asked him about height. He said his favorite height in women is 5’7”. Then I asked him about weight and he said he likes women very thin, so he ballparked 100 lbs. I had to tell him that’s not a healthy weight for a woman that tall. He just shrugged. I asked him if he likes toothpick legs and he said he loves those. I said I liked thicker legs but he said he found those gross. 


Because of the ideal woman he so far has described, I then asked him if he likes small boobs. He said it doesn’t matter as long as they are fake. He said he likes them stay looking like grapefruits or oranges even when the women are lying on their back. He also said he hates the natural sag that real boobs have. He also said he isn’t willing to date women who stray much at all from his ideal standards. Now I pretty much know what type of women he’s going for. It clicked in my head why my son never had a girlfriend or more hook ups. His standards are way too high. I didn’t want to knock him down though because if that’s what makes him happy, then I’m all for it. My son is 6’1”, fit, handsome, and a charmer in my eyes, so it’s likely he will find that one if he puts himself out there. We also talked about what personality characteristics he found attractive so this talk wasn’t just about the superficial. 


Last night, I was talking to my wife about the type of women my son likes. She never asked him in that much detail. She doesn’t even know about his solo hookup. After hearing all of that, she asked me if I warned him that he’ll never get a girlfriend if he keeps up this impossible standard. I told her that if he only likes that type of women, then more power to him because I believe he will find her if he puts himself out there like I encouraged him to do. My wife still pushed me to “disillusion” him though. I frankly don’t think I should.",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister that her being gay can be jut a phase?,"I will try to make this brief cuz the whole story can be very long.

&#x200B;

So, my big sister (20) told me and my mother during an argument that she was gay.

As any normal person both of us accepted my sister choice, after all, its her life.

The problem is that every time that we have an argument she uses the ""I am gay"" card.

Every argument that we have she says things like ""You don't know how it is to be ME!"" or ""We suffer more than you!"", even when this topic isn't in the conversation.

Because of that I decided to have a ""Real Talk"" with my sister. I explained to her that while I didn't see any problem with her decision, the way that she is using the ""Gay card"", makes it seem like she was using that only to win arguments.

I even told her that because of this type of arguments, It makes her look ignorant as that is the only answer that she gives. (Even when we talked about the high mortality rate in our country she used the ""Gay card"" like it was a competition about who dies more.)

End of March is gone and SIL is still in the house and my husband spends his entire time with her now.

Anyway, I had had enough yesterday when I found her completely occupying the couch and told my husband that she'd have to pay rent if she is to stay here any longer.

My husband looked appalled and said how could I ask her to pay rent in these conditions and that I was being heartless. I told him that at least I hadn't kicked her out.

So a little over two years ago, my husband and I got married. We had been planning the wedding since before we got engaged (a bit cart before the horse) and had a date picked out over 1.5 years before the actual engagement. We picked 10/13/17, as it was a Friday the 13th in October, so super spooky, and in our favorite season. Not that it matters, but we got married young (me barely 22 and him almost 25). 

Annie, my old college roommate and one of my closest friends at that time was my maid of honor. I'm not a party person, so we didn't even have a wedding shower/bachelorette party, so she didn't even need to plan anything. 

Two weeks before my wedding, a different bridesmaid had to drop out due to taking finals she couldn't miss. That was fine, I had another friend I asked and he accepted. Then, less than a week before the wedding, my friend Annie dropped out of the wedding because her grandmother died and the memorial was the same day a couple hours earlier. (I found it weird they had it on Friday the 13th since her family is SUPER religious, but c'est la vie).

I completely understood her need to be there and know it was NOT her fault. I asked if she could try and make the reception at least, and she said she couldn't. I'll admit, I was really sad, but I got over it. 

However, after that, I didn't hear from her for some time. She never apologized and never initiated text conversations. 

She ended up getting married about a year and a half later, and while I was invited to the wedding, I wasn't part of her bridal party. I decided to forgo the wedding as I knew I would just bring negative energy and didn't want to ruin her day. At this point, we hadn't spoken since MY wedding. 

Lately, she's been trying to ""reach out"" by leaving comments on Instagram posts and liking Facebook statuses. I refuse to acknowledge her in any way, as she never apologized for how much hurt she put me through. She is trying to act like everything is normal (years after no contact) and never even texted me, just public comments. 

I want to reiterate that I am not mad at her for missing my wedding, I am hurt that she didn't make an effort to come to my reception and that she never reached out to me afterwards. 

So Reddit, AITA because I won't forgive her and plan on never talking to her again, even if she were to apologize?

EDIT: Many of you are thinking I want her to apologize for her grandmother's death. I just wished she would have apologized such as ""I'm sorry I couldn't be there with you, I wish I could have, but there were more pressing matters."" 

She never asked about my wedding after, she never brought up anything. I did check in with her and text her condolences and make sure she was alright.

UPDATE: I'm not going to reply to anyone anymore. If you think I'm TA, fine. That won't change how hurt and upset I was and still am. Feelings are more complicated than Reddit seems to comprehend.",Asshole
AITA for bringing take out & alcohol to a wedding?,"My (26M) friend A (27M) got married recently. He & his fiance/now wife Z (26F) had planned the wedding date months in advance, before the pandemic, and weren't able to cancel, but were able to downsize their wedding to just family & close friends.

Both of them are Pakistani Muslim, which means their wedding wasn't a regular exchanging of the vows. Also, apparently, there are two weddings in Pakistani culture one where they sign the official papers and one that's kinda a party wedding, which was this one.

Anyway they had family on both sides over - all Pakistani Muslim - as well as friends on both sides, Muslim and non-Muslim. I'd say maybe 10 family members on each side, and then 5 of Z's friends and 5 of A's friends (including me).

Since the majority of the wedding was Muslim (all 20 family members, themselves, a friend on her side and two on A's side), all of the food was traditional Pakistani food, halal, etc. I think originally they had catered this and different cuisine when the wedding was larger, but were able to cancel when they downsized. Most of this stuff I've never eaten before, so I thought I'd bring something small for myself. I don't think this was their main issue, although I don't think they were very pleased with this either. 

Almost every wedding I've been to has served some sort of alcohol. I thought they wouldn't mind if I brought a bottle of it - another one of our friends had gotten married about a year ago, and A & Z had attended the wedding and neither had complained about the alcohol being served, although they had kept their distance from the bar. 

Z's friends were the first to notice, three of them came over to me and asked if I could throw it away, saying that distance from alcohol is pretty important to them, and that it's borderline haram (basically Muslim-illegal) for them to host an occasion where they serve alcohol, even if they aren't drinking it. They got pretty upset at me when I said it wasn't a big deal (even though none of them were Muslim??) and kinda shuffled away to tattle.

At this point I noticed a lot of their family smelled??/noticed it and were kinda eyeing me. A approached me and, said something to the ladies, brought me to the side, and asked my why I had brought it. I told him I thought it wouldn't be a big deal and brought up the wedding we had been to earlier. He said that it was different, since they were guests at the time and this time it was their wedding. I told him if it was such a big deal to him I'd throw it away but it didn't really make sense to me why it was, even after he'd explained it. 

After the wedding, A called me about why I would do that after they specifically let everyone know there would be no alcohol at the wedding and we kinda went back and forth for a while, and then he finally told me that if I couldn't respect his religion he didn't think we could be friends anymore. 

I don't think I was disrespecting their religion. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not wanting my daughter to play D&D with her ex-crush,"My daughter wants her ex-crush (who has a girlfriend) to play D&D with their friends since she says it's the only thing still tying them all together.

AITA for turning a whole class against a student?,"I’m taking organic chemistry, which is even worse than gen chem. The exams, and tests are unnecessarily hard, and the class itself is complicated. We all seem to be struggling, besides this one person. 

Our professor is unfortunately still taking her lectures very seriously, and assigned us a test worth 25% of our grade on Monday. Most of us  cheated (besides that one student) despite her claiming everyone has a different version of the test. We ended up doing much better compared to before. Well since the rat didn’t cheat, he didn’t do as well as those who cheated did, and therefore the curve was messed up. So he screenshotted the group chat texts, etc everything and emailed our professor. She cancelled our scores, and “will be taking further action”. 
It was clear that he’s the one who ratted like a bitch, so somehow i brought it up on the gc, and most if not all of us turned on him. Some people sent him angry texts etc calling him out. He says it’s all my fault, and this “harassment” has caused him so much “distress”. AITA?

AITA for telling my friend that she comes off as a spoiled brat?,"Me and my friend are both 23 year old women.

My friend lives in a really nice city in a beautiful apartment. She makes a lot of money from software engineering. I'm really happy for her and her accomplishments.

However she seems to have built up quite the ego ever since she started making money. She makes unnecessary purchases just because she can. We got into an argument about this the other day. She hasn't had a TV in her apartment ever since she moved in and decided she finally wanted to buy one. She immediately went on Amazon and bought the first 32 inch TV she saw. It came in two days and I was with her when she was setting it up. The first thing that came out of her mouth was ""hmm, this is really small"" and she proceeded to debate with me for the next 15 minutes on whether or not she should return it and get a new one.

I told her that it was fine and she sort of agreed at first but then she was like ""nah I don't like this size"" and she immediately goes on Amazon and buys the same TV in 60 inches. I told her that she was being really impulsive and has no patience and that she's dumb to not even look at the return policy before impulsively buying a bigger one.

She said that if she can't return the smaller one, she'll just keep it in her bedroom and that it wouldn't be a loss. This really annoyed me because I felt like she was rubbing the fact that she's SOOO rich and can just buy whatever she wants when she wants in my face. I think part of being a good friend is holding each other accountable and keeping it real with each other. So I told her she comes across as not understanding the value of money and how it's a slap in the face to people who have to work three times as hard just to get the smaller TV. She kind of got upset and asked me if I really thought she was trying to come across that way, and I said well yeah, you come across as kind of a spoiled brat.

She kind of started to cry and I switched the subject. We haven't talked about it since but when I explained the situation to my mom she told me I was a complete AH and to apologize to my friend. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for asking an older man to leave the skatepark my kids were at and then threating to call the police when he didn't?,"We are a military family and just arrived at our new duty station about a week ago. We chose the neighborhood specifically because of all the activities for kids (a huge centralized park with playgrounds, native desert, a swimming pool and a skatepark). 

My kids have always wanted to try skateboarding so after we got them all set up with the appropriate equipment, I took them over to the skatepark at the park. For the most part it was an ok experience, but I wasn't a fan of the language the teens and preteens were using but I figured that was their ""turf"" and the last thing I needed to do was start an issue with them. 

However, there was a much older man there, he just creeped me out. I'm not sure how to describe it. He had pads and a skateboard but he only rode it maybe once every 10 minutes. But something about his look just seemed off to me. He also reeked of marijuana smoke. Finally he actually ran into my son while they were at the bottom of one of the pools and I had enough because it seemed so deliberate. I first asked him if he had kids, he said something really creepy like ""these are all my kids."" I said maybe it's time he found a new hobby. He was so incoherent I don't know what he said next but it was something about his ""soul"" which really creeped me out. So I told him flat out I think it's time that he left. He said he was leaving anyways in 20 minutes since he had to work. I told him maybe he should just leave now. He said no. I said I was calling the police and finally he said that he didn't want any trouble and he'd leave. I told him if he didn't want trouble maybe he should chose age appropriate activities. What I hadn't noticed is that several of the teens were close by and when he left they said things like ""maybe your fat ass should be the one to leave!"" and b-word and c-word and on and on. I had also brought over a specialty concert chair to sit on and one of the kids had thrown it over the fence into the main park.  This truly scared my kids. I dialed 911 and we left the park. It took almost 4 hours for the police to come to our house and the officer said that in the future I should call them right away. 

however my husband is furious with me. He thinks that I've instantly made us a ""marked"" family in the neighborhood and maybe the older man really was there to enjoy himself. My point is my husband wasn't there and I tried to act on my own instincts and they telling me this older man was up to no good.",Asshole
AITA for telling someone her bad expirience at Cons are entirely her fault.,"Posting because it aleays comes back around this time every year.

You see I am part of a group of anime fans (yes I am a nerd, sue me) and while I dont personally go to a lot of cons (I am not very social but like the handcraft of most cosplays) the rest of the group tend to organize to go to something like 5 or 6 every year. The problem comes from another member of our group, lets just call her Ann. You see, whenever there is a session to organize to go to a Con with a first timer , she always, ALWAYS, has to say,"" just make sure it is not like MY first expirience at a con"". Her first con was Dashcon. Last time I will be honest, was in a bad mood so just told her ""we told you not to go, we told you it looked fishy from the beggining, so please stop talking about that f;$*%€%£ing thing"". She got angry and stopped talking with multi-sillabic words and mostly was grunts and noises. Most of the group was indifferent but a couple of her friends told I should have not told her that, as she was only trying to help.

Let me be very clear, we are NOT teenagers, when Dashcon happened we were NOT tennagers.We do not livr in the USA. We DID tell her not to go as everything looked kinda sorta weird. I mean I probably was an AH but how much is what I am unaware.

Edit for.popular demand:
Well, it was DASHCON. From the list of things she always says I suppose the short version is:
× Arrived early and had nothing to do as there were no panels for hours
× Got her room downgraded by the staff (no one knows why)
× She paid for the Nighvale and SPJ thingies (even after everyone and her granma told her not to) and every songle thing was cancelled
× Won a price consistent of a half melted chcolate ( the ones the hotel puts in your pillow)
× Went to a couple panels where she could not hear anything due to audio problems
And mostly
× Had no money because she decided to donate her ENTIRE pocket money in the donation bag money ( this is always the main thing and we always roll our eyes as , we always see it as somethung that was completelt her fault)

Edit 2: The donation bag was not the Random Acts bag, was the ""Hotel hates us and wants us to pay 17k to remain open"" bag",Asshole
AITA for posting a funny picture?,"     I created this account solely for the purpose of this post, my son told me to post here to get an impartial opinion. 
     I (F45) was recently at the grocery store (I don't want to name it, I don't know what the rules are on brand names but it's a large, well known chain grocery store) grooming myself a little before going in. I often do this in the parking lot, I have excess nose and eyebrow hairs and I want to be sure to look presentable. A car across and several cars down from me caught my eye. The occupant was a young woman with dyed hair and visible tattoos, which struck me as rather trashy. I noticed her because she was adjusting her nose ring, which appeared to have been stuck on something and out of place. I thought this was hilarious and snapped a picture. I think she noticed because she gave me a dirty look.
     I showed my daughter who has a nose ring the picture and to my surprise she got angry, she said that it was rude and creepy and that I should be ashamed of myself! As if I were the one doing something disgusting like that in public. I posted the picture on my Facebook wall (I have quite a large following on Facebook) and for some reason I got many similar responses from people I thought were my friends.

WIBTA for taking my cut?,"For my daughter’s birthday I always got her scratch offs. I never really thought she would win anything but this time she won $500. She is 15 and hasn’t been as excited with that being her present. When I realized she won I took the ticket and said I would redeem it for her since it’s her birthday. She doesn’t trust me with it and is complaining hard. I plan on taking around half of it since she would waste it anyway, and I don’t think she realized she won that much. Also, I already give her enough money to do things with friends, and clubs and camp.

EDIT:

&#x200B;

I feel like I didn't give enough information. She doesn't know how to save and doesn't really help around the house. She has bought expensive makeup and given in away to friends. This is more money then she has ever had and I want to make sure it isn't wasted.

AITA for having a ex-friend of mine fired because i had concerns based on the way he behaved with me?,"Throwaway. Also, had to delete a lot to fit the subs requirements.

I (currently 30F), was friends with “Hugh” two years ago (he then 22 and me 28). He was a sweetheart and really good friend. He was in love with me and he told me his intentions. I told him that i wasn’t ready (at the time, i had just ended a really toxic relationship).

I admit that during our friendship i wasn’t the best with him, i lied to him on several occasions and he told me several times how hurt he was for the things i had done, and asked why i never apologized. I decided to do it, because i thought he deserved one after everything i had done. He didn’t accept the apology, he claimed that my apology was a ‘sorry you felt this way’ instead of owning it. Fair enough.

After that, he demanded some money he had loaned to me, because he told me he wanted to cut ties with me for once and for all. I gave him his money and gave me a gift he had prepared for my birthday (at the time, my birthday was 2 months away which surprised me.)

Three months passed by, and he told me he wanted to talk, and clear all things up and asked if he could come to my house, which i agreed. However, he asked back just two books he had given to me. I gave the two books to him but that day wasn’t feeling well, so i told him i couldn’t welcome him, which made him angry because he lived pretty far away, but left.

I knew that after we parted ways, he had been really down and angry. I heard he commented some things with some friends regarding our friendship. He told our friends ‘How he was so stupid because he had read all the Jojo’s manga arcs because of me, and she (me) couldn’t be bothered to read a book i gave to her” which is true. I never read the book because i had seen, although he told me how important it was to him. He watched all the 7 seasons of Game of Thrones in one week because he wanted to see what i liked and ‘know me well’, which is fair, but i think doing such things didn’t mean that i had to be his girlfriend.However, one month ago i learned that he was working as a teacher at a private school (he is really good with english and french) but was worried for the childrens. If he didn’t have patience with such things with me, he couldn't have patience with them, so i sent an email to the principal and one week ago they messaged back, that they were thankful with my concerns and that he was being laid off.

I commented with a friend that knew him and she told me i was an asshole and a bitch, that his friendship with me didn’t mean that he was a bad person or with bad behavior. He possibly could’ve acted better and not going telling things and being angry, but didn’t mean he was a bad teacher or treated the children badly. That i possibly hindered his possibilites of getting a new job because working with childrens is such a serious subject.

I disagree, i think my concerns were fair, but my friends keeps telling me i am a bitch, although he doesn’t know it was for me he was fired.",Asshole

AITA for using death as an argument in a fight with my bf after his dad died?,"Long story short: my bf recently got a kitten (Martin) who has a cat sneeze. He called the vet who diagnosed him over the phone and prescribed him medicin: tea grounds for his eyes and pills without knowing his weight. For all of this my bf paid only 5 dollars  his cat is still sick.


My bf became a huge cat daddy (expensive toys ect) since he got his cat but he refused to get a seccond opinion because this lady is a vet for 15years and is a proffesional so she knows better than me.


Also, my bf's dad died recently and the wounds are really fresh, especially since he died from a lung illnes that can spread easilly (not covid).


It's obvious this vet is sketchy so I begged him to get a seccond opinion but he refused and was rude so I went nucreal, sending him articles ect, trying to convince him with reality check and tough love. If this illnes won't get treated properlly his cat can lose his eyes and even die. Also, I have a cat with herpes and since we don't know which virus caused Martin's cat sneeze when our cats meet they could get even more ill (I think, one of that viruses is worse than the other)..


I managed to convince him not to use tea grounds and to get Martin checked one more time but he wants to go to the same vet so here we go again, an argument.. 


I thought changing our cats to us and our lungs illnesses (I have asthma and he's going to get checked but I'm sure he won't die because he's young and don't have symptomes) will make him change his mind so I said ""imagine if I'd somehow give you my asthma and you'd give me your illness, we would both be fucked. Why would you put our cat's in that situation?"" instead of answering my question he started insulting my vet because I'm taking my cat there frequently and it's expensive. I told him ""you're right, people with cancer are doing it wrong. They're paying a lot of money for their frequent treatment while they could just call a doctor and get some painkillers.""


Now we aren't talking to eachother but I already apologised for being to harsh but I still feel like an ahole...

AITA for reminding my daughter that my love life is none of her business?,"My wife is terminally ill. Because of that, she has been unable to show me any forms of physical affection and the spark in our marriage is nonexistent.

We cannot divorce because the legal logistics would rattle shareholders in our company. Therefore, she agreed I could see others if I kept it away from the family.

I have been dating this woman for about a year. At first we were careful not to show PDA when we went out but over time she told me how much that hurts so we started being affectionate when we were out on dates.

A few months ago, somebody from my daughter’s school took a picture of me kissing my partner and posted it on social media. My daughter ended up throwing a tantrum because it was a topic at her school and she got a bunch of comments and questions.

I explained that it was an agreement that her mom and I had, and I deserve to be happy.

Things have just cooled down, but for my birthday yesterday, my partner ended up sending me a present and a note that said she loved and missed me. She also sent my daughter a card congratulating her on finishing middle school. 

My daughter started screaming at me that she wanted this woman out of our lives. My wife also got mad because my daughter was sad, claiming I wasn’t keeping it away from the family and that I let this present thing happen in front of my daughter’s best friend, who she invited over for cake. 

However, she forgets that I really wanted to spend time with my girlfriend for my birthday but I abandoned that desire for the sake of the family. 

My girlfriend makes me feel loved, and I love her very much. She has given so much to me, and I refuse to let go of my happiness because I feel my daughter would understand if she was older.

AITA For telling my step daughter that the tooth fairy is not real?,"My (F 38) husband (M 36) have been married for over 1 year. He has 2 kids with his ex, a daughter (7) and a son ( 4). I have no kids, nor do I want any. But I do love my step kids. They came to visit us after quite some time, as they couldn't come over during the lockdown.

&#x200B;

My stepdaughter, Kate\* (name changed) excitedly showed me a $5 bill with some glitter on it. She told me she had lost a tooth and her mom told her to place it under her pillow and the tooth fairy had left her the bill in exchange for the tooth. Now, my husband's ex is a good mom, and I really didn't expect her to feed her kids such illogical nonsense.

&#x200B;

I gently broke it to Kate that the tooth fairy is not real and it was m=her mo  who placed the money under her pillow and she should thank her. Kate looked confused but after I explained to her that this tooth fairy stuff is just something adults make up, she seemed to understand.

&#x200B;

Later that day, I got an angry phone call from Kate's mom Shirley (name changed). She yelled at me for telling her daughter about the tooth fairy being fake and how dare I ruin her child's fantasy world. I told Shirley she was overreacting and that it's important for kids to know that they get gifts  due to the kindness of other people, and fictional characters. She yelled at me some more about how I made her out to be a liar. I told her she was being ridiculous and hung up.

&#x200B;

She later called my husband and gave him an earful, but he stood by me and told  Shirley to back off.

&#x200B;

AITA for doing something Kate's mother should have done?

&#x200B;

EDIT : You've all made it quite clear that you think I'm TA. However, and bear with me, I feel like the reason behind Shirley's anger may be something other than what I told Kate. When Kate left my home, she seemed cheerful as ever. We had had lunch and watched a movie and she seemed fine. So I don't think Shirley is protecting her daughter. You see, my husband actually left Shirley for me shortly after their son was born. Drake (name changed) always encourages  his kids to spend lots of time with me and to listen to me. He has confided in me that he wants Kate to follow in my footsteps and not her mother's. Shirley hasn't worked a day ever since she and Drake married and now lives off of the alimony. While I have a successful career, and he wants his kids to idolize me and not her. 

&#x200B;

Shirley senses this, although Drake has never said this to her and has often accused Drake driving a wedge between her and her kids, especially Kate. This is untrue, Drake may believe that I would be a better role model for Kate, but he would never want to jeopardize her relationship with her mother. 

&#x200B;

Also, this isn't the first time that Shirley has made accusations like this. Back in Feburary, Kate was asked at school what she wants to be when she grows up and she replied ""*a hedge fund manager like (my name)*"". Shirley was furious at this and called Drake to berate him. He told her he had no idea what she expected him to do. 

&#x200B;

So Shirley's anger may stem from the fact that I imparted wisdom to her daughter and not from what I actually told her. So, there is a bias involved on her part. ",Asshole
AITA? I want to put a cat down.,"My wife took-in a female cat about ten years ago.

This cat was for all accounts - feral. You can tell that in her early life she was a house cat but we can't pick her up or put her in a cage to go to the vet, even to this day.

It's breath at times is just horrific. This may be farts. I don't know & we can't really tell.

It wipes its ass on our jute rug. The rug is a large woven rough twine-like weave. She raises her back legs in the air & scoots along using its front paws, driving its ass into the rug. There are, at times, visible skid marks that need to be addressed, which is hard to do on jute.

We live in a nice home. Ever since we moved-in five years ago this particular cat sprays right by the door leading into our garage. Smell is fucking awful. And it never disappears no matter how hard you clean. So, whenever we enter our house from the garage that stench is the first thing that greets you.

There is a litter box in our bedroom...on my side of the bed. Well, I've had cats all my life & NEVER have I smelled anything close to the disgustingly foul odor that comes off this cat's shits shits. Everyday.

I want to put this cat down. Of course, my wife just can't bring herself to do this.

I like the cat and I am the type of person that will feel great remorse in taking this type of action.

I figure, if we drop it off at a *Rescue Village* the next adopter would have to face the same circumstances. I would imagine this cat would go from pillar to post. And its life would be an extended hell.

I can't leave it outside in good conscience because my neighborhood is loaded with raccoons, foxes, and coyotes.

AITA for not doing anything when my(28M) GF(30) was insulted by my neighbor(mid 50s F)?,"Me and my GF of 4 years have been staying at my house for the past 6 months. She is incredibly beautiful and always has eyes on her from men. I bought her a sexy robe that she likes to wear before an intimate night. She used to, if she was in a state of undress, wear it out of the house to let out dog out, and pick up after him, or to get something out of her car or the mailbox. She stopped because our neighbor, a mid 50s older gentleman, would leer at her from his window or from his porch. She was very uncomfortable, to the point where she asked me to walk her from my porch to her car even when fully dressed. When I started doing that, the guy stopped looking.

I knew the guy was married with adult children, but I haven’t really ever met his wife. So when I saw her out on the porch staring at my girlfriend I was very confused on who she was. This happened a few times before my girlfriend, who isn’t afraid of her, called her out. I was walking her to her car, when my girlfriend looked at our neighbors porch and there she was, my girlfriend asked, “Why are you always looking at us, we’re cute and all, but no need to stare”. The woman came back with vitriol, telling my girlfriend she was being rude and unladylike. I could feel what was happening so I tried to get my GF to her car. She refused, so I got into her car.

When I was a kid I was always told to never get in between two women fighting if I love one. I’ve done this my whole life and have let my girlfriends deal with their own arguments. Apparently the neighbors wife was pissed at my GF because she was tempting her husband. I thought this was ridiculous and so did my GF. She said that it’s not her fault her husband wants her more than he wants his wife. This led to the woman saying that my GF needs to stop dressing like “some type of stained whore that just crawled away from her last porno shoot.” I sat there mouth agape and my girlfriend started moving towards her yelling, so I got out and had to pick her up and out her in the car. 

I drove while she and cried out of anger over what happened. She has had to deal with people calling her  shaming her in that specific way since she was like 15 so she takes it incredibly hard. I tried to comfort her and she got livid with me. She told me that I was a jerk for not stepping in until after that happened. I told her that I don’t like getting into the middle of her fights. She told me that she needed my help and I just abandoned her until the woman went after something that really hurt her, and that it was by proxy, partially my fault.

They started terrorizing my dog, taking stuff without permission, broke my dead grandfather's vase and the youngest kid took a shit on my carpet and smeared it. 


I finally had enough and screamed at them. I told them to leave and they insulted me before leaving. My neighbor got mad and called me an asshole for being mean to her kids.

"AITA for anonymously reporting my sister's bullying tik toks to the school, making her lose her valedictorian title and scholarship?","

My sister is a senior at high school and I am a sophomore. She was about to be valedictorian at graduation this Spring.

She has a tiktok account where she posts videos of herself and ones she takes at school and home. Some of them are kind of nasty, filming people unaware to make them the butt of jokes. She's filmed me for it, including filming me when I was crying.

I made her take down the video of me but she still did similar things to other people. I honestly didn't get all the jokes, some were weird tik tok inside jokes I guess? But they had people being sneakily filmed and made the butt of a joke, which isn't cool.

So after a while of that, I went and screen recorded all of her nastiest videos and sent an email to the school guidance counselor. I used a throw away email address and said that I wanted to anonymously report bullying by a student at the school towards other students. And to watch the videos attached. I pretended to be a concerned bystander rather than someone who was bullied.

And the school took it really seriously, they talked to everyone in the videos, and their families, and took disciplinary action, suspending my sister and one of her best friends. 

Because my sister was suspended, she wasn't able to be valedictorian anymore. Another girl at school got the title.

My sister and parents are mad.

My sister is pissed at the other girl who she says doesn't deserve to be valedictorian because she came to school after being homeschooled just that year so she only needed to keep her grades up for one year, compared to her four years. 

My parents are furious because my sister losing the valedictorian title means she lost her full ride scholarship and my family will be in a much worse financial situation having to pay towards her college. They're furious at whoever ""cowardly person sent in that report without even telling them"". 

They wanted a chance to resolve things before it came to this, and said whoever's parents had known about this and not talked to them before getting the school involved were cowardly, for not even trying to have a parent-to-parent talk.

They were mad at being blindsided because the school had already made the decision to suspend my sister (and make her lose her valedictorian title and scholarship) before they even knew anything was up. 

Nobody knows I sent that email. I had been thinking of coming clean but after the way my parents have been so furious at that anonymous person... I don't think I will.

I feel like my parents care more about my sister becoming valedictorian, and having a full ride scholarship, then they care about anything else. They've been so involved in her academics and college admissions 

AITA for sending an email to the school?

----+----+----+

Edit to add, to address the question ""Did you talk to your parents / What did you say?""

I told them about the video she put up of me and they told her to take it away but they didn't really get what was going on because they're not tech savvy and don't even try to be. 

I think they don't understand the problem, because honestly the videos don't make a lot of sense... They're like bizarre tik tok memes that I don't even reallly get. 

So from their perspective, my sister did some vague bizarre ""computer thing"" that they don't understand...  And then all of a sudden the school and other parents are involved, and the scholarship is being taken away with no warning.

----+----+----+

Second edit to address the question ""Why did you go so nuclear / Did you know what the consequences of involving the school would be?""

I actually have seen bullying get reported to the school before, and they absolutely brushed it under the rug. Hell, I was half expecting to get no response at all after having sent the email anonymously.

So I was surprised they actually did more than a slap on the wrist or a handwavey ""well there's two sides to every story"" or ""well, kids will be kids"" 

However, after it's all said and done, I don't think what happened was ""nuclear"" or disproportionate. 

To be honest, I think a valedictorian should be someone who represents the school in a positive light, leads by example, etc. They have the honor of giving a speech to celebrate the whole grade's graduation. 

And the way my sister behaved... Was not that of a leader or a positive role model. 

The girl who's valedictorian now is honestly so much more of a positive role model, she's hardworking and kind. She's also faced some bullying for her quirks from having been homeschooled up to the age of 16, and she's always handled herself with kindness and dignity.

----+----+----+

Edit to address the question... ""How are you sure it was bullying if you didn't get the tik tok meme humor? / What was in the videos?""

There was some stuff that was pretty obviously bullying, like a video of a learning disabled student having a breakdown, cut in with my sister and her friends dancing in a way that made fun of him, cut back to him, etc... 

Or one of a girl and a guy at school having an argument about their relationship, something really private and emotional, cut in with some pop song snippets and my sister doing some weird dance where she was slapping herself?? 

Like I don't get the whole tik tok meme context but she was super obviously filming people at embarrassing or personal moments to make fun...",Not the A-hole
AITA for sending my wife to the car after she tried to breastfeed in public?,"As we were taking a walk, our newborn started to cry, so we sat down on a bench to feed her. 

As I was reaching for one of the bottles we had packed, my wife suddenly pulled out her breast! 

I asked her what she was doing and told her, ""We have bottles"" but she said, ""I know, it just hurts."" So I felt bad for her and gave her the keys and sent her to go breastfeed in the car. 

After five or ten minutes of sitting on the bench, I got up, walked around a little, and went back to the car.

Now she's mad at me. She said I embarassed her by making her go back to the car, but I think it was embarassing that she tried to breastfeed in public when our car was not that far away (I could literally see it from the bench I was sitting on).

AITA for forcing my (ex) friend to choose between his religion and me?,A few days ago we were allowed to meet up with a friend again. So there is this person I've been friends with for about 4 years now. He's also catholic. I decided to meet up with him and to come out as gay. When I told him he was pretty chill about it and said that he supports me. So I asked him if that meant that he was dropping his religion. He said no. This kinda got me pissed because how can you support both such an anti-gay community and a gay person at the same time. In the end I told him that it was either his religion or me. He just told me that I'm crazy and went away. He hasn't even texted me so I decided to just block him on everything. My sister feels like I'm being over dramatic but I stand by my standards.

Him and his ex are on okay terms. My friend started dating this new woman and she is gorgeous. My friend was always in good shape but I was surprised he was able to pull someone so attractive. We had a BBQ and I said in front of my friends and wife that he is a Stud. 

Since then I feel like a lot of the other wifes have taken it really negatively me and him. Saying that him going for someone so much younger shows he wasn't focused on the marriage. and me for only valuing a woman for her youth and beauty. I don't know her personality I am just impressed.

AITA I stole my dog back,"So I (19M) recently broke up with my girlfriend (18F) and I moved into her apartment. So I left her apartment and moved into my own. I went back to collect all my clothes, stuff and dog. When I arrived, I couldn’t find my dog. I asked her about it and she said it ran away. I didn’t believe her so I texted her friend on insta. She said she saw my GF (ex) walking it at her other friends house. I went to her house around 2 hours away and saw my dog running in her backyard. My dog came running up to me and I opened the fence and picked up my dog and brought her home. A police report is “being filed” on me now for stealing “her dog” when I bought him and have all the info and vet records. If a report is filed, I will for sure win but everyone believes that it was my gf’s dog and now I’m being blown up saying I’m a dick and asshole for stealing him.

AITA for not wanting to deal with my boyfriend's periods?,"Preface: he's trans. Still menstruates. Refuses to go on testosterone.

Bf is smart, hardworking and very mature for his age. We get along very well. Part of the reason this rship works out so well is because he's independent and doesn't ask for much and that works out fine with me because I like my space.

Except when he has periods. Dealing with them has been stressful. We live together since May (because of virus) and have dated since December. When he had periods, he wouldnt meet up with me and said he'd deal with it. I said ok. His period in March was ok, but he was in a lot of pain for whatever reason. In the days leading up to it, he was irritable then he was very whiny and clingy. Wanting to cuddle to sleep and rub against me and stuff. Nothing like the man I like. It was jarring. I cant deal with emotionally open people and part of his appeal is he ISNT emotionally open, so I wasnt sure why he was doing that. June, I got very busy with work and when he tried it again I straight up told him he didnt have the time to coddle him. He told me the reason he was clinging (in the SUMMER) was because he likes body heat from actual people. I wasnt comfortable with that so I got him those hot water packs. He said its not the same, but whatever. I was just busy, I wasn't being an asshole on purpose.

Our relationship was very strained after and I wasnt sure why. In the lead up to his current period he was very irritable with me, and when he was whiny he would go talk to his friends rather than talking to me. Two days ago he got it and he didnt disturb me much thankfully. This is where the problem is: yesterday night he came to me WHILE I WAS WORKING in tears hunched over saying he was in too much pain and asked me to put him in my lap. Absolutely not. We dont do that regularly so I dont see why now. I was working, and he's bleeding so I thought it wasn't unreasonable to say no. We had a bit of an argument, and then he eventually just left the room. Next thing I know, he called HIS EX BF (who is still his friend?) and the ex bf took him to his own house. Obviously I am not comfortable with this. I called him a couple times but his ex bf just texted me to say I should reconsider before being such an asshole for no reason.

This is unfair to me because our relationship isnt that emotionally open. We have boundaries, and he's not usually like this. Am I really such a dick for not wanting to deal with someone on their period who isnt rational and acts completely different to the bf I know?

Edit: a lot of people are asking. I am 28 and he's 21. Also we have talked about me not being emotionally open. He knows this and has willingly entered a relationship with me. I'm not sure why he went and called his ex, presumably telling him how bad of a person I am over something HE ALREADY KNEW but there's that.",Asshole
AITA for missing my daughters birthday to play golf with an old friend?,"My ex-wife and I broke up 3 years ago on mutual terms. Unfortunately we had fallen out of love, my daughter stayed with my wife. I only see my daughter once every two month's since she lives an hour away. She's a real swell girl, doing really well at high school, everybody loves her.

A week ago my ex-wife asked me to come to my daughters birthday party, it was going to be a small gathering because of the pandemic. Her grandparents were going to be there and her mother got my daughter a vanilla cake. Since I've always valued family I said yes. 

Well unfortunately it turned out that a high school friend invited me to play golf at the same time as my daughter's birthday. So this is where I ran into a dilemma. Keep in mind I hadn't seen this friend in years and we had been best in friends in high school. We were on the football and track team together and he helped me become the person I am today. I see my daughter very often, but since he's come from out of town I might not see him a few years. 

So I called my ex-wife and told her I couldn't go to the party and I was very straight forward with her. I told her I see my daughter all the time, but I might not see this man for another couple years. She was livid. Maybe it was her hormones, but she screamed at me. Apparently for not paying attention to people and being oblivious to people's feeling's. 

I went to play golf and had a great time. I called my daughter later that day to wish her happy birthday it went to voicemail and I sang her happy birthday. Her mother sent me a nasty text, saying my daughter was very upset. At first I thought everyone was being petty, but now I'm wondering if I came off the wrong way.",Asshole
AITA for making my friend cry with my pregnancy?,"Throwaway due to friend following my account

So me (F30) and my boyfriend (M32) have found out we’re expecting our first baby. We couldn’t wait to tell everyone, but waiting until the 12 week mark to tell our friends and family.

So we hit the 12 week mark with zero problems. We tell our parents who are absolutely ecstatic and I decide to tell my 3 friends via zoom call on Friday night. I call them and we’re chatting so I decide to tell them my news. All three of them look incredibly happy for me and while two of my friends were asking me questions one of my friends (we’ll call her beth) suddenly shut off her camera.

My friends and I kept chatting and I just brushed it off that she went to the toilet or something. But when she came back, she was sniffing and looked like she had been crying. One of my friends asked her if she was ok and she said she was. Suddenly all of them were asking Beth if she was alright, even though she was insisting she was fine.

To be honest, I was getting annoyed with her  because of it. She has been struggling with fertility issues since she was 19 (now 30) and it was like she was making my news all about her. It felt like she was stealing my thunder, so I said to her “Look I get you’ve had fertility issues Beth but you don’t have to make everything about you”

She then logged off and my friends said i was being an asshole because I should be more sensitive to her needs. Frankly I think she should be more sensitive to mine as I’m the one who’s pregnant and who’s going through a life changing experience, not her.

It’s been a few days and Beth still hasn’t called to apologise, but my friends think I should. AITA?

**EDIT 1:** To those who said I was insensitive, I've been friends with her since university, I've heard her talk about this for virtually 10 years and I've been as supportive as I can. This was supposed to be a happy moment to celebrate something that was happening to me and by shifting the conversation, she basically made my moment all about herself.

**EDIT 2:** Update: Due to the negative comments, I decided to reach out to try and move past this. I texted her and said “ Hi \[Beth\] look, i’m sorry if you were upset the other night. But you can’t expect me to hide my pregnancy from you. If it was that upsetting, maybe you shouldn’t have come back to the zoom call. I understand you’re probably feeling emotional, but sitting there sniffling was going to attract attention and im sorry but this just wasn’t about you. I want to move past this and I’m sorry that you got upset, but i feel we both need to be adults”.

She responded with the following.

“\[OP\], we have been friends for 9 and a half years and I was so happy to hear you and \[boyfriend\] were finally starting a family. But you know me and \[Husband\] have suffered two losses and have had our second round of fertility treatments canceled due to the virus. I don’t want to make it sound like I’m making this about myself, that’s honestly the last thing I want, but I just needed a moment to compose myself because it was another reminder that it wasn’t going to happen for us for a while and I just got a bit emotional. However, I never tried to steer the conversation to talking about my issues and you didn’t need to bring it up on Zoom, even \[friend 1\] and \[friend 2\] have said you were acting like a complete bully bringing it up.

I think I need some distance for a while. I love you, but that just wasn’t fair. I’m over the moon for you guys and I’m sure you’ll make great parents. But I need some time to think”

I tried to apologise but she wasn’t having it. I guess I’m going to wait and see how things progress from here.

**EDIT 3:** I honestly cannot believe some of the hurtful things ya’ll would say to a pregnant woman. Thank you for those who spoke in my favour and agreed that she shouldn’t have acted the way she did. She’s now blocked me, but not before sending me a very long 'woe is me' message that's too long to post in an update. I'm just disappointed in her for wasting ten years of my life on her sorry ass. I don’t need someone holding me back or putting a downer on things because of fertility and anxiety bullshit. Here's to finding a better support network!",Asshole
AITA? Might have got a coworker fired,"I have just started working at an aesthetic clinic and have been here for 4 weeks. (I actually stole a managerial position from the coworker in question because I may have told them she was too nice and wouldn't be great as a manager so they gave it to me) For the first two weeks I hated the place and confided in the coworker I was actively interviewing elsewhere and she she sympathised with me. This coworker is incredibly sweet and a great worker, she has been here about 4 months. Anyway I think I may have got this girl sacked and I don't know what to do and I want to know if I am the asshole.

Basically she lost her bank card Monday and was stuck for lunch and her bus home (she lives 2 hours away) and neither myself or another coworker had any money she could borrow so she borrowed it from the petty cash. The main manager was with patients so couldn't sign off, so I did and the other Co worker did.

Anyway, yesterday the main manager called me into the office to see how things were going and was I managing the store okay and I don't know why but I told him that everything was great but that this coworker had stolen money out of the till and has since replaced it. I also told him that she doesn't smile enough sometimes and that I have caught her on her phone once or twice. I'm not sure why I did it, I'm not gonna lie she's extremely pretty and nice and it does annoy me sometimes because she's a great worker. Anyway, she got called into the main managers office and left in tears and went to the bathroom, basically her job is on the line as he is calling her a thief and a liar.

When she came back she asked me why I lied abut her and I told her that she technically did steal and she said she gave it back the next day and that I signed off on it, I've since misplaced the envelopes and I don't want to have anything to do with this anymore and feel ill lose my job if I speak to the main manager about this.

I just feel guilty though as her boyfriend lost his job last week due to a new disability and his job involves a lot of lifting.

AITA for kicking down my enemy when she's already suffering?,"So I (22M) graduated university last year. There was one girl (22F) who would always be a huge bitch to people, and she was bitchy to me. We will call her 'The Bitch'. Though mostly, it was through talking about me (and other people) behind our backs.

I knew from a mutual friend, that she would say shit like ''throwawayaloal is a weirdo'', ''throwawayaloal is weird, why do you (saying to my friend) hang out with him?'' etc, even ''throwawayaloal is a dumb shit'. 

So to my face she was civil but behind my back, not so much. I know I should have confronted her, but given that she was part of the social circle (she was my friends housemate; lived in a large house at uni of 15 people) I didn't say anything, but I resented her.

Anyway, I used that anger and hatred to motivate myself to study. I would pull all-nighters very often to prove people wrong. I fueled myself with hatred. As a result I got very good grades and got into a top university for my masters degree.

Now I secured an internship at a pretty prestigious place. I've been on full bragging mode on my snapchat, posting snaps like ''I knew my doubters were dumb shits'' (I knew my doubters would see these snaps, so I was being intentionally inflammatory).

I went back to my university city recently and saw my old friends who are still there. Anyway, they were on the phone to The Bitch and roasting her, poking fun at the fact that she is struggling to find a job. So I said ''Pass the phone to me''. 

Given that I was more confident now and didn't really care about social reprucussions as much (cos I don't go uni there), I took the phone and said ''Hi, its me throwawaaloal''. She said ''Oh, hey'' and then I proceeded to say this:

Me: ''Hahahaha, heard you couldn't get a job, yet your best friend (22F) has already landed an internship too. I've also got an internship at _____''

The Bitch: ''Oh, wow good for you''

Me: ''You're such a dumb shit that you can't get a job, and you studied a useless degree anyway. Honestly you have no chance anyway, maybe I can ask my boss at ____ to get you a janitor job''

Her: ''Is this the only reason you called me?''

Me: ''Hahaha'' (pass phone back to my friend)

It felt GOOD to get that off my chest, but my friends said I was an asshole and that she's already suffering (her boyfriend broke up with her and her friend has a job). 

I think it wasn't enough. Living a good life isn't good enough revenge me. I want my enemies (people who doubted me/hated on me) to suffer. I want to kick them while they're down. If you're my enemy, I WANT you to fail and suffer. This is the mentality which makes me successful but my friends disagreed, AITA?",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister that she doesn’t know what it’s really like to have depression because she’s a beautiful girl?,"My sister (25F) is a singer-songwriter. She finished writing a song and wants my feedback on it. The song is about her having depression and telling other people that they don’t know what it’s like when they don’t wallow in her misery with her. This is the first time I (22M) truly don’t agree with the message of her song. She never said to me that she was depressed before. She just complains about trivial things sometimes. I’ve never been depressed. 


So after listening to the song, I asked her if she’s really depressed or just writing about it because she has admitted to writing songs that aren’t about her own experiences in the past. She said that she does feel depressed sometimes and people don’t really understand what it’s like because they either make it a competition of who’s going through the worse depression or they just flat out belittle her depression like it’s nothing and will just go away. 


I asked her what has she got to be depressed about because she’s a beautiful girl (I’m not just saying that because she’s my sister), doing what she loves, makes decent money, and has a nice boyfriend from what I can tell. She said there’s more under the surface than she’d care to share because she thinks that I’m belittling her just like the people she directed her song to. I told her that she doesn’t know what it’s really like to have depression because she’s a beautiful girl and just because of that, she can get basically anything she wants in this world. 


She told me to fuck off if I’m that insensitive. I told her that my take is that many people will disagree with the message of her song, although the music and flow are great. She said that she thought I would at least have her back when she bared her soul out to me. I told her that it’s hard to feel pity for her because girls like her shouldn’t feel depressed. They could feel sad occasionally, but feeling depressed is just too farfetched, especially if she doesn’t care to share the details. She screamed at me to fuck off, so I did.",Asshole
AITA for scolding my sister she shouldn't be racist to our neighbors,"Basically my sister moved in with me 3 weeks ago due to complications in her marriage. Things were going really well and I enjoyed being able to spend time with her as that hasn't been a possibility over the last 5 years.

I am very good friends with them and they have helped me so much since I moved in and anyways they came around for coffee and showed me the note expressing their concern.

We have been living together for about 4 months and I let it go for a while until I finally brought it up about the way she dresses around the house. She walks around bra less which is bad enough but the shirts she wears are baggy and lose most with no sleeves so from the sides you can see everything. 

I've had several talks with her. And she always says she will do what she wants in her house.  I try to explain my side.

AITA for telling my friend that it's stupid and selfish to refuse to use effective birth control?,"My boyfriend and I live in a somewhat isolated/rural area, so we were excited when a couple around our age (late 20’s/early 30’s) moved close to us, and SUPER excited to learn that we shared a lot of hobbies. We’ve become really close with “Jeff” and “Jane” and have been spending a lot more time together, either in pairs or all together.

Over the weekend our boyfriends were fishing together so Jane and I were doing some of our own hobby stuff the two of us (we both grow some really niche kinds of plants, though not the same kinds). The conversation was going and somehow sex came up, which lead to talking about birth control. I was stunned to hear Jane say that she doesn’t use real birth control AT ALL, just condoms and “cycle tracking”. When she saw my face she tried to justify this by saying that all of the kinds of hormonal birth control she’s tried give her awful side effects, and when she tried the non-hormonal IUD she had really horrible cramps ½ the time. I explained to her that those side effects (depression and loss of sex drive) are completely normal, that I take anti-depressants just to deal with the emotional side effects (my gyno says about half of women on hormonal BC do this) and I’ve had to teach myself to learn to be into sex and enjoy it even if I’m not in the mood at first. It’s stupid not to be on birth control just because it gives you side effects, all medicine can have side effects! As a woman you just need to power through, because condoms are significantly less effective, they’re just not the most responsible option.

And it’s not just that it’s foolish to use a not super effective form of birth control when there are so many more effective options out there, it’s also pretty selfish to make her boyfriend use condoms and sacrifice his own comfort just so that she doesn’t have to deal with issues that pretty much all women have. Pretty much any man will tell you that condoms decrease a guy’s enjoyment of sex, if it doesn’t erase it completely. TONS of men have condom induced erectile dysfunction—my boyfriend included—so should they just go without sex forever? No, of course not, I don’t think anyone would say that, I think pretty much everyone would agree that it’s on those guys partners to use birth control. 

Although I was honest that I feel bad for Jeff and don’t think he should be on the hook if Jane ever accidentally got pregnant, I NEVER said that Jane is stupid or selfish, only that her decision in this regard is. I was clear that it was the decision, not her. Still she left upset and they’ve been dodging our attempts to get together since then. 

My boyfriend is totally on my side with everything I said, but is still upset with me for ""driving away our friends"" by not being more tactful. I thought my mom and sister would understand that I was trying to help Jane AND Jeff, but they both said I should have kept my mouth shut and let Jane make her own mistakes. AITA here?",Asshole

AITA for no longer being a performing bear?,"I'm a pretty big guy and spend a lot of time in the gym, my friends often call me the BFG because I'm rather docile and slow to anger. In my social group I'm sort of a drunk performing bear. I lift people above my head, twirl them around, balance them on my shoulders and do other tricks.

For me it's all in good fun and I often have to grab people to lift them, but I always check with them where it's ok to grab them or touch them.

We were in the park last week and another guy tried lifting people up, it ended with everyone collapsing in laughter. Everyone seemed to have fun and we all jokes around. He was being rather handsy with one girl, but she seemed ok with it and I saw no uncomfortableness.

A week later he's been kicked out of the group. Why? The girl's BF wasn't happy and she then complained that the guy tried to grab her body against her consent, which didn't happen. Since then I've refused to touch anyone and I say ""Don't know when you'll change your mind, don't want to risk getting kicked out""

Now I'm told I'm being an arsehole and I'm no longer fun because I'm overreacting.",Asshole
AITA for telling my classmates that we are not same level?,"this happened a while ago, we completed high school and all my classmates wanted to celebrate it so they went to a mall/restaurant, they invited me too I said no. Even before this they invited me to a lot of parties I always declined but they didn't stop calling me. This is probably the 10th time I said no.

 I just don't wanna be around or go with them. I just hate to be around  racists, sexists, castists, homophobic, Islamophobic, religion discrimination, judgmental hypocrites (not all of them but most of them) and other reason is that I don't like to waste my money, even tho they said they'll pay for me I refused. 

So on the day where they were partying for the last day, they called me multiple times and I didn't pick up. As they kept calling I picked it up and they asked me why I was behaving like that so I said ""idgaf about what you guys think but we don't vibrate in same frequency, I hate to be around you guys"" they said I was rude and hung up. Later they texted me and said that they put the call on loud speaker and everyone heard it and was upset at me, and I was too rude for that.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to look after my son?,"I am in an open relationship.

I’ve been with Heather since she was 17 and I was 21, we’ve been together for 6 years now.

I’ve been with Taylor (25F) for 9months.

Part of the open relationship thing is we have to respect each others boundaries and we came to the agreement early on that we didn’t want to hear about each others sexual encounters.

I have two children (4 and 3)

I had been out with my eldest when Heather called me screaming because our youngest had a seizure.

In my moment of panic I had to think of what to do for the best and I didn’t think bringing a screaming 4y/o to the hospital was for the best so I messaged my mother/sister/brother/uncle etc and the only responses I got were that they were unable to.

I messaged Taylor and she responded saying she’d love to see my eldest (he’s met her before, twice) so I dropped him off and rushed to the hospital.

My youngest had a seizure because of low blood sugars, she’s fine and at home now thankfully.

I explained briefly where our son was and at that moment Heather didn’t react.

But we got home and she starts screaming at me what a betrayal of trust this is and what a shallow man I am etc, she’s taken the kids to her mothers and isn’t responding to me unless it’s to update me on our daughters health.

I panicked and who thinks logically then? Heathers argument is that my mother would’ve been free or I should’ve bought our son to the hospital where she could’ve thought something through as she knows several family members  who would’ve dropped everything.

As I said; wasn’t thinking logically and we should just be happy our daughter is healthy(-ish)

"AITA for being a ""transphobe""?","Throwaway because person mentioned knows my main. This was pre-corona for reference.

I (23 M) was at a friend's house (let's call him R) with some of my friends to watch movies and have some drinks. Things were going well. Towards the end of the night, R calls everyone to come to him, as there was something important that R had to say. R said that he had been struggling with what his gender was, and that he was genderqueer. None of my friends (or I) knew what genderqueer meant, so he explained that it meant that he was something in between male and female. R then asked to be referred to by the pronouns Ze and Hir. My friends gave him blank stares, none of them knew what he meant. I asked if we were supposed to call him a him or her, but R insisted on ze and hir. Another friend asked how we were supposed to remember those, but R started crying. My friends and I were baffled now, and most of them started leaving. Later, after everyone left, R said in the group chat that we were disgusting transphobes, and that he was dumping all of us. The guy in the group chat agreed that this was ridiculous, but when I talked to some other friends, they said I was a massive AH and needed to apologize.  


EDIT: Many people are saying I should apologize to R. However, after the incident, R has blocked all of us, and I cannot contact him again.

AITA for prioritizing my health over my younger sister's ability to fall asleep?,"Throwaway because someone might identify me through my main account.

So, this happened a while ago, but my \[23f\] sister \[16f\] just brought it up again and she is convinced I'm TA, so here I am.

Basically, a few years ago, when I was 18 or 19 and my sister was 11 or 12, we had a relative stay over at our house. As the oldest, my parents let me claim the guest room (which was massive) as my bedroom, with the caveat that I'd have to give it up every time we had a guest. So when this guest visited, I slept in my sister's room. For context, we didn't really get many guests, and when this incident happened it was the first time I'd had to move out of my room in years, so my sister and I weren't used to sleeping in the same room.

Now, my sister wanted the lights on and the window open. She said she struggled to sleep without these two things. I, however, can't sleep with lights on. If I sleep with the lights on, or if even some light is on (like a nightlight), I get terrible headaches. Like pounding, may-linger-even-after-an-advil-or-two headaches. I also can't sleep with an open window, because it will guaranteed a terrible sore throat, and most likely a cold, by the next day. Believe me--I wish I could. I've had many sleepless nights in the summer because I'm hot, but can't open a window.

With all that in mind, I insisted she turn off the lights and not open the window. She believes I should have negotiated, and only asked for one of those things, especially since I was older so, as she sees it, I should have been more mature and considerate. I think that, while it is unfair that she had a harder time going to sleep, it was the best scenario, since ""negotiating"" would leave me with either a raging headache or a minimum two days of sore-throat misery. So in my mind, it's not really a negotiation--my health should take priority over her discomfort (because struggling to fall asleep sucks, but it's not like she literally *couldn't* sleep, and she would have no ill-effects in the morning).

If it matters to the judgement: when she brought it up today, she claimed that she got a headache from having the lights off.  I don't remember this being the case at the time, and honestly it feels unlikely (I still can't sleep with lights on, she's slept with lights off for years now; she's misremembered tiny details about arguments before; and I'm pretty sure the lights thing was just because she used to be a little afraid of the dark), but her take on it is that we should have compromised by, I guess, having me get a headache instead of her? And going with lights on, window closed. Again, not sure if she really did get a headache or if she's misremembering things, and/or if I knew about it in advance, but I'm throwing it in for full disclosure.

So, AITA for prioritizing my health over my younger sister's ability to fall asleep?

Edit: Since I'm having to say some things often now, some clarifications. My sister did not have major issues falling asleep--she had a slightly harder time than usual (like, if she normally takes 15 mins, she took maybe 30), but she was asleep before I was. She also has no conception of me ""invading"" her space, being an ""intruder"" etc. Culturally, it's common to do this when guests come over. It's common for someone to vacate their bedroom when guests come over; it just so happened that I'd essentially offered in advance for the larger room. She doesn't see it as ""you came into MY room and made the rules"" but rather as a simple question of, if our needs clash, you should have compromised (with my take being, while I wouldn't want to cause her discomfort, it wasn't a question of equal needs but rather mild inconvenience vs being sick). Also, I made the deal about my room when I was about 11, and it had never been a problem before then, because my siblings were all younger and used to sleep with my parents. My sister also could have chosen to sleep in my parents' room if she had actually had trouble falling asleep.

Also, I've seen enough AITA posts to know that many of you won't believe me on this, but: I love my sister, I care a lot about her, and I would not want to cause her any pain. If I had thought she would have anything happen to her (nightmares, insomnia, being really scared of the dark, a headache, anything), I probably would have sacrificed myself and dealt with the (truly awful) headache.

As it was, what I remember being told is that she would have a hard time falling asleep--that's it. If she mentioned a headache in advance, I don't remember it; that said, I know that if I thought she was being serious, I would never have dismissed her. As it is, she has a tendency to be dramatic, and even she admits she was a brat growing up, so I exercised my judgement at the time (knowing her, knowing her medical history, etc etc) that she was making a big deal out of things but would be just fine, mentally and physically, whereas I would definitely not have been. If she really did get a headache, I would consider myself somewhat TA, understanding that at the time, I wouldn't have taken her seriously (since she didn't get headaches EVER as a kid).

Edit 2: Also I will try to limit myself to only answering INFOs, since, while I don't necessarily agree with some people commenting YTA or ESH, I'm not here to battle it out with strangers, just get third-party opinion

Edit 3: Also, I've had insomnia. Really really bad insomnia. If I thought my sister had suffered even a little bit of lost sleep because of me, purely based on the hell that is insomnia, I would consider myself TA. As it is, she did not lose sleep. She just wasn't in an ideal sleeping environment, although I should stress it was still a decent sleeping environment. She wasn't happy, but she wasn't tossing and turning either.

A final edit before I go to sleep (ironically): The question is not really about me being in her room, neither of us argued about that. The question is, assuming the only option was for us to be in the same room, AITA for insisting on the closed window and turned off lights? ",Asshole
AITA for making an 'offensive' joke about college applications?,"Yesterday, the college application process 'officially' began for rising seniors. My friend group is aiming for colleges such as the Ivies, MIT, Stanford, and Duke among others.

Today, I was hanging out with a few friends. One of them was talking about how he's unsure about his chances and is worried. We started talking, seriously at first, but then we all just started joking around to make him laugh and to calm our own nerves. I said 'just say you're black and a gender studies major, that'll improve your chances' (he's Asian and planning to be a bio major). Most of us laughed, but one guy didn't find it funny and called it 'offensive' (funnily enough, he was neither black nor planning to study gender studies).

I asked him why he found it offensive, and he said we shouldn't make jokes that insult groups. I told him 1) we have a right to joke about situations that impact us. We're asian and mostly applying to 'competitive' majors like comp-sci, bio/chem/neuro, or economics, so that means the application season will be very hard for us-- Asians are viewed pretty harshly, and 'competitive' majors means, well, competition for spots. It's stressful and jokes are how we relieve our stress. 2) the core statement-- that it's easier to get in when you're an under-represented minority or applying to a major with less competition-- isn't untrue. What's there to get offended about? We're not saying something incorrect like 'black people only got in because of their race', I just stated a fact.

He doesn't agree, and thinks I'm TA for making that joke. He also thinks everyone else is for finding what I said funny.

WIBTA for making an ageism complaint against one of my coworkers?,"Genuinely wondering what y’all think of this situation I’m in.

So, I work in an open office environment with a large group of coworkers. For the most part, we’re all at various points in our twenties, except for one colleague I’ll call John. John is late 30s, early 40s range.

Because of our job we often have conversations about major events or life experiences. There’s a lot of  discussions like, “I was ____ years old when ____ happened.”

And every time anything with age or time periods is brought up, John butts in with a massive eye roll and “OHH MY GOD UGGGHHH I was (this much older than you) when this happened!” And talking about how times have changed, and he can’t believe how young we are doing the jobs that we do. This happens several times a week.

Quite frankly, I’m sick of it. I’m well aware it’s a stupid thing to get mad about. But I worked really hard to get to where I am today.  And I had to fight to prove to managers with that same mentality that I was, in fact, just as good at my job as someone with 10+ more years in the business.

One of my friends says I should report him for ageism. I’m not sure if that’s the right decision but I am massively fed up with this...especially when the guy isn’t really that much older than me (I’m late 20s).

AITA for laughing at a fat joked aimed at my son?,"My 19yo son is about 6ft and needs to lose about 20 pounds. He was always skinny, but I suspect his eating habits got bad while he was at college and he just wasn't working out. He's been home since March and I've been egging him to go to workout with me. He doesn't want to. We had a 4th of July picture taken of us and he could no longer hide that belly. I tell my son discreetly that he has put on weight and he denies it. He says I am the only one who tells him that.

Tonight, he came home with Taco Bell. I don't think I've had Taco Bell since high school and I would rather have let my kids starve before feeding them that garbage. My younger son who is 9 asked him what he had. He had order three burritos and these churro things. Oh, and a Dr. Pepper. My son replied ""no wonder you're so fat."" It came out of so left-field that I couldn't help but to laugh. My 9yo is hardly mean. He's just very blunt and observant.

***EDIT: After my 9yo's comment, my 19yo threw his Taco Bell away without eating it.***

AITA for having gotten mad at my daughter’s 2240 SAT score?,"This happened a while back but is still a point of contention in our family. Back in December 2015, my daughter went on a retreat with her high school team. They left on a Friday and came back on a Sunday. So on that Sunday I was obviously there with other parents, waiting to pick our kids up. One mom, who my wife and I are sort of close with because we’ve chatted throughout the years, said that her kid had gotten a 35 on the ACT. 

And on Saturday, I was catching up with an old college friend. He has 2 kids, and one is my daughter’s age. The older one went to MIT and has a great job in software engineering, making about 200k a year at this point in her career. I was talking to him about being worried about my daughter’s college admissions. He asked what her SAT score was, and I said, “Sadly only 2240.” This is out of 2400, for reference. 

He replied, “Man, yeah, I hope her SAT subject tests are better.” So after hearing what my friend said and what my wife and I’s acquaintance said, I felt awful, ashamed and scared. I was worried my daughter was going to have to compete with a kid with a 35 on the ACT and that she would never get into any MIT-level colleges. Moreover, I just felt so ashamed that I didn’t have anything to brag about. A 2240 is like a 34 on the ACT, which is lower.

So when we drove home and arrived at my house, I tried not to show how mad and disappointed I was, but it eventually slipped out. She had taken the SAT in October 2015 and honestly I’ve been on and off pissed since then. I thought the 2240 would disqualify her from the Ivies and Stanford and probably would have kept her from getting any Regents’ scholarships at the UC schools. 

In the end, my daughter got waitlisted at Columbia, UPenn and Stanford and rejected from the top Ivies. She made it into a pretty good school (top 15) with reasonable tuition and my wife and I were really proud.  She ultimately was deciding between UCLA and Berkeley and chose one of them.

AITA for trying to get a co-worker fired for having a service dog?," Last summer, my employer hired someone new. On her second day here she shows up with a dog, telling everyone on our shift it's her ""Service Dog"". I personally don't like dogs at all, and honestly this girl doesn't even look like she's sick or disabled? Our manager told us that he told her she could bring it in but he didn't bother asking our shift for our approval about it so we all feel blindsided and I told him none of us are going to work with her or train her and there will be problems if he lets her keep bringing the dog. The dog was huge and looked like a police dog, not even the right breed for a ""Service Dog"" and it mostly just laid under her desk the whole time.

She told another employee that she has him for ""PTSD"" and said she has heart problems. She looks like she is only maybe 25 or so and doesn't look like she did any military service and I personally think she's lying about everything and is just not all there in the head. Working with someone like that worries us. Most of our shift and night shift wrote e-mails to our manager saying we didn't want the dog here and had concerns working with someone like her, but he wouldn't listen to us and said the dog has a right to be here? He likes dogs so of course he doesn't care.

None of us on that shift want to be around a nasty dog all day so we made several complaints to his boss and to HR, and she went on leave for a good month before coming back without the dog. Manager moved her to another shift and I'm skeptical if it was even a real service dog at all if she can come back without it, plus she didn't even have it on the first day she worked with us.

HOWEVER, just a few days ago she showed up with it AGAIN. The other shift doesn't seem to care but sometimes there is overlap once or twice a month where she could be on our shift and I DO NOT WANT TO WORK WITH A DOG or a brain damaged girl. We immediately complained again about it being there and she said that her accommodation to have the dog was approved by HR and says she wouldn't need it with her all the time but just on some days when she was ""in bad shape"" whatever that means. I think she's faking. She does not look sick at ALL.

No matter what we do management isn't on our side, even though our manager's boss agrees with us, HR doesn't and seems to be on her side which is really infuriating. Our shift threatened that we'd have to quit if she was allowed to keep the dog with her at work and we've expressed we refuse to work with her because of it, and told HR that we have people in here with dog phobia or allergies and basically anything we could come up with to get rid of her but they don't care.

AITA If I cut up my boyfriends wife’s wedding dress?,"First post on reddit (hello)

They’re on good terms now and she says she doesn’t care what happens to the dress and neither does he. 

I like to sew and repurpose fabric to make things and the wedding dress has really interesting fabric and beautiful red embroidery on the bust and I’m really interested in what I can make from it. 

I haven’t heard the wife say it’s okay but I trust my boyfriend saying that she doesn’t care 


I’m not sure if it’s weird or not to take scissors to his wife’s wedding dress so AITA if I do?

Edit 2: the wedding dress in question isn’t owned by the wife. She left it with my boyfriend 

I really just love the idea of giving new meaning to old things to give them a new life and carry on a story

I allowed her to tag along to my mothers funeral even tho I was reluctant so this time she  must respect my decision.  She tried to argue with me that this is not my decision to make and she would like to be part of that. I’m trying to get her to not come with me because I feel like this is a personal time for me and I would like my alone time with my family and she is not respecting that. And it’s not like my mothers death affected me the way it affected her so I don’t see why she wants to be there because I the end of the day, her parents are still alive and I only have my father and siblings left. We argued back and forth but eventually I won and she said fine, she won’t come. I talked to my father and siblings about it and I was surprised of their reaction. All of them told me that that was an asshole move and if she wanted to be part of it and remember my mother as well and wanted to be there with us then I don’t get to tell her no and kick her out. My father was pissed and proceeded to text my wife telling her that she could come if she wanted to. Did I go too far ? I’m I an asshole for what I did ? I thought it was reasonable because 1, I wanted to be alone so in case I get emotional or something, my wife won’t be here to see me. In front of my wife I try to appear tough (even tho I have been an emotional wreck). I still get emotional from time to time. That’s why I hide from her.",Asshole
AITA for not feeding another woman’s baby?,"
This just happened to me this morning 
I am a first time mom and my son is 3 months old. I do breast feed and I feed my baby no matter where we are. So if you don’t like that I pop my boobie out for my baby whenever he’s hungry don’t read this. 
 
So I have only taken my son to dr appts since COVID started. Well my grocery store just started doing this thing for the elderly and mother with kids. At 8:00 to 9:00 the elderly get to shop and from 9:00 to 10:00 the children under 2 and their parents get to shop so I decided to finally take my baby to the store to do some shopping with my husband. 

We did our shopping quickly and almost no one was in the store. I was super happy that the shopping trip went great until my baby starts crying so I tell my husband to check out while I go and sit on the bench ((I used a Clorox wipe on the bench before sitting down)) to feed my baby. So I get a blanket out cover myself up so no one sees and feed him. 

No big deal. 

Well I’m almost done feeding him when a mother with a screaming baby walks towards me. I figure maybe she’s coming to sit next to me? No. She comes up to me and stands super close to us ignoring social distancing and looks at me like she waiting for something. I ask may I help you? (I’m Me -Entitled mother is EM -my husband is H -and EM husband is EH) 

Me- can I help you?
Em- yes can you hurry up feeding that baby?
Me confused- He is almost done if your trying to sit down I don’t mind if you sit next to us. 
Em- no I don’t want to sit I need you to feed my baby. 
Me- excuse me? 
Em- I didn’t bring formula and my baby is hungry so can you just feed him? 
Me- no?

At this point I’m confused and weirded out. My husband is done checking out and is coming up to us with the cart so I get up and pack up the diaper bag. 

Em- WAIT YOU DIDINT FEED MY BABY
Me- I’m not feeding your baby. What if I was on drugs or something your going to trust a complete stranger to feed your baby? 
Em-you just feed your baby. Your not on drugs. 
H- get away from my wife you psycho. 

We start to walk away when she starts screaming at the top of her lungs and her husband come running from the back of the store thinking something is wrong. 

Eh- what’s wrong? 
Em- she won’t feed our baby! 
Eh- what? Why would she feed our baby?
Em-I forgot the formula. 

The manager of the store comes up to see what’s going on and why everyone is yelling. I explain to him what is going on while the EM is still screaming at the top of her lungs. At this point my baby is crying her baby is crying she’s screaming and I have a headache. 

She gets to talk to the manger first and he comes to me next saying that EM told him I stole their formula and to leave the store and don’t come back or he will call the police. My husband told me to just let it go and we can find another store so we just left.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting mad at my son?,"This morning I (35F) was at the store getting groceries and called my son (14M) and told him to get off his game and go clean the grill, and when I came home I found him cleaning the griddle, moving all the things that had been on top, and I got mad and yelled at him for being so clueless at what a grill was! He told me he thought I said griddle but I just told him to put the things back on top of it and that I'd do it myself because honestly nobody in the house but I can do things the right way. He just walked back inside the house after that. I feel like I shouldn't feel bad, he cant be like that clueless when he has a job and a career!",Asshole
AITA if I don't want my 41 year old GF to miss her chance of having a baby?,"My (F 51) Girlfriend (F 41) and I talked about having a baby a few years ago, and in that time have gone to a couple of appointments. We live in Canada and I have good benefits, so after the third appointment they gave us all the info about what we do. They said we could order sperm any time and they would try insemination. There was also a waiting list for In vitro of a few years, so we got on that just in case the insemination didn't work. My Girlfriend has said she always wanted to have a child. She has a very small family (mother, brother) and a somewhat rocky relationship with her mother. I would love to have a child with her and was excited by this whole process, however My GF seemed to be dragging her feet on every step. The clinic had my phone number, so I have been encouraging her, though she has said she felt I was pushing her, we just needed to get these initial appointments out of the way and then we would be on the list, and she could do it in the future.

Both other appointments she was kind of on edge and we fought about me being pushy, but I just wanted to be encouraging. I want her to be able to use my benefits to have a baby and she has said she wanted one many times.

In the last 2 years My GF has lost her job in a really traumatic way, gone on and off antidepressants and found out she has skin cancer, but couldn't see a doctor right away because of Covid, so will be going next month. Our relationship has deteriorated as well, partially because she is on edge because of the above. We argue about 2 - 6 times a week and mostly sleep in separate bedrooms.

Last weekend she wondered out loud if she was still on the list, so in my mind that meant she still wanted to do this. However, they called and left a voicemail yesterday asking if we were still interested. I sent her a text about this but she didn't respond. (We are in a fight though) Last night at dinner I brought it up again and she said ""that place has the worst timing"" but didn't listen to the voicemail so I brought it up again and she said she didn't want to talk about it.

I'm not going to lie, I was secretly excited when they called and I don't want her to miss out on her chance. Even if she doesn't want to have a baby with me, I still don't want her to miss her opportunity, so I just started playing the voicemail and she got mad. I said fine, I'd call and tell them to take her off the list, and she lost it and stormed off to her bedroom.",Asshole
AITA for uninviting this girl over because she told me she's on her period?,"I know the title makes me sound like a dick but hear me out. I have a casual-situationship with this girl in my group of friends. We have sex about three times a week but she always stays over and we hang out and talk and make breakfast and stuff. We're in the same graduate program so I see her every day and outside the bedroom we're friends. We have a specific agreement, she is NOT my girlfriend.

She was supposed to come over last night, we agreed we'd make risotto and the sex was implied. She told me she went to get the ingredients for risotto and then texted me and said she's looking forward to the night but also mentioned that she's on her period. I said ""oh alright, I guess I'll just see  you next week then."" She called me and said ""you can't be serious, can't we still hang out?"" and was really upset because she already got the groceries bc idk man she can just eat them, period stuff freaks me out. Its not like she's my girlfriend and I have an obligation to her, we'll just fuck next week, idk what's the big deal is.

Anyways now its been 24 hours and she won't talk to me. She's also really close friends with my roommate and so roommate heard the story and called me a massive dick. I don't see how what I did is wrong.

EDIT to specify: she has told me on multiple occasions that she is NOT into period sex, so I uninvited her because we wouldn't be having sex and that's not the night I was anticipating. If no sex is on the table then there's no point. ",Asshole

AITA for telling my ex gf I know she is a “greedy bitch” but still cheaper than a prostitute?,"So to be quiet honest I have a large business and I’m doing amazing financially, and my 2 year gf was like 9/10 but I’m an average looking dude. So I kinda knew what I was getting into

Well we argued last month and, I told her I knew she was a “greedy bitch looking for my money” waiting for her to be offended at least and say otherwise but she wasn’t and mentioned the expensive af car I bought her and all the other stuff in a “I used you and you can’t do anything about it” manner.

I was annoyed by that and told her, “still,  getting a high tier escort daily would have cost more than you so I was the one who actually used you” 

And then after a moment of silence I said a stupid thing “and also escorts don’t allow bareback as you did”.

This was a lot for her and she broke into tears, I left the house, and when I returned I didn’t find her and haven’t heard from her since.

AITA For telling my girlfriend she is not attractive?,"Before you read the title and immediately judge, I just want to say that my girlfriend has an amazing personality, very funny, witty, etc. She is not great in the looks department but I can see past things like that.

The incident happened on Friday, me and my girlfriend were out with a few friends. One of my friends recently got a new gf and he showed us a few pictures of him and her. I looked at his phone and said to him ""holy fuck she's hot, great job man"" and then I made several more comments like ""I am jealous"" throughout the night.

When me and my gf got home, she asked me ""do you find me attractive?"" and I was honest with her and told her something like ""no, but that's not why I love you."" She started to cry and despite my best efforts to reassure her that her looks are not important to me, she refused to listen.

AITA for asking my wife to make me dinner?,"My wife and I have three kids - 12, 7, and 3. I work all day and she stays at home with the youngest. She plans to go back to work but not until all the kids are in school full time. For the most part this arrangement has worked out fine. The only problem is that lately I've been going hungry more often than not. 

Our two oldest are in sports and between the two of them, there is some sort of practice every night. I don't get home until late so my wife takes them. She has worked out the schedule so they eat before practice and then come home and go to bed. Sometimes it's an actual dinner and there are leftovers that she will set aside for me to heat up when I get home. But at least half the time, dinner is a rushed affair of chicken nuggets, raw veggies, fruit, and yogurt.

On those nights, she will come home, put the kids to bed, and then proceed to make herself dinner. I'm talking like pan fried fish, or a pasta dish, or fancy salad with homemade dressing. I should add that she is a phenomenal cook - most of her dishes are restaurant quality or better (everyone she has cooked for agrees). 

I get that she doenst always want to eat what the kids want to eat. I have no problem with the late night cooking. I'm just hurt that she rarely includes me in her dinner plans. I find it so inconsiderate that she goes through the effort of making herself a fantastic dinner and excludes me knowing that I obviously also haven't eaten. I can microwave chips with cheese and that's about it - and clearly it's not healthy to eat that for every meal.

Finally the other night I just hit my limit and blew up at her. I said that it really sucks to be working a full time job, which btw pays for all the groceries, and not even have the benefit of a home cooked meal. I'm her husband, not a roommate and it would be nice to have a sit down dinner with my wife! She genuinely looked both angry and hurt. She said that it wasn't her fault that I couldn't figure out how to feed myself while the kids are at their sports. She was pretty rude about it and sarcastically asked if my hands worked. That I could always have whatever she makes for herself but it's ""not her problem"" if I don't prefer what she made.

Now I'm a pretty simple guy - meat and potatoes and I'm happy. It's not like I'm asking for something elaborate - much less elaborate than what she fixes herself! Every now and then she will make me a steak when she's cooking for herself but that's not the norm. Weekends are fine because we're all home so we eat as a family. But to me, for most of the week, she is considering everybody's tastes and needs except for mine and I feel totally unappreciated and like a second class citizen in my own home. 

Anyway AITA for wanting to eat dinner with my wife like a normal married couple?


Edit: She makes enough dinner to share - that's her reasoning for why she's not TA. The thing is that usually she is aware that it's not something that I prefer. I'm a pretty simple guy!

More info: I'm honestly confused by all the YTA. Isn't the purpose of marriage to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses? She's good at cooking and I'm not. I'm better at providing and she benefits too. And also, can you explain why it's so unreasonable to ask for my tastes to be considered? If we go to the movies, we go watch something we BOTH enjoy, not just one of us. I don't see why this is different. I'm not asking for special treatment. And not that it should matter, but on top of not having dinner with my wife she's also usually ""too tired"" for ""adult relations"" even though she stays up way late reading. So maybe it's not just the dinner thing but that lately I don't feel like she wants a husband - just someone to pay the bills. I feel like if one of my needs were being met it wouldn't be such a big deal.",Asshole

AITA for making my 11 year old child 90$ in debt?,"This is a throwaway. English is not my first language.

So my 11 year old girl has been saving up money to buy an iPad since the start of the start of the year. She finally saved up enough money to buy one. When she sent me the link to it on the website(It was a trusted one) I ordered the iPad for her. However, what she didn’t know(I didn’t either) was that the price was in USD and we live in Canada. When it came I set it up for her and told her how much she owed me(90$) When I told her she was very shocked. She asked me if she could give me something worth the value of the money and I said yes. She ran to her room and grabbed her small drawing tablet that was worth around 80$ new and 60$ new. I told her if she could find the box and she said no. I told her that it was worth less than 10$ now. She went to her room and hasn’t come back out yet. I know that she doesn’t have anything else she can sell/trade.

So now I’m wondering if I did a dick move. Reddit, am I the asshole?


Edit: Around January she came up to me saying she was going to need an upgrade for a drawing tablet. We went online together and she told me the one she was talking about. It was from the iPad 10.2. She said she was going to save up for it before I even said she was going to save up for it. Also she has full understanding of conversion rates for those asking.

AITA for asking if Male/Female/Attack Helicopter is harmful/offensive as gender selection in our game?,"Today, I woke up to see the game I'm working on be the topic of discussion of [a top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cluxhg/game_devs_add_attack_helicopter_gender_option_in/) on r/asktransgender due to the fact that, as a joke, we included the 'attack helicopter' option when selecting gender in a specific minigame we have.

I knew the meme is sometimes used in a toxic way but mainly remember it from being all over YouTube comments many years ago around the time that a lot of silly furry-related stuff went viral so it seemed harmless to me.

It was my idea to include it and the whole game is kinda full of memes and is very tongue-in-cheek so I didn't think it would be interpreted as hostile. I was not invested in the meme being in the game and didn’t mind changing it unless this is overly politically correct and not the right thing to do…

So I decided to make a post in r/games saying mostly the same things as I’m saying this post and asking if I should change it. Because there have been instances where a game changes things to cater to those who take offense, only to then face even more criticism because it turned out that it wasn't really that offensive. 

While some of the responses were insightful and helpful, a surprisingly high amount of em insisted I was obviously propagating a meme that they claim was always transphobic and I ended up getting tons of personal messages that did not show much understanding, to say the least.

I’ve discussed it with the other devs and we’ll be changing it because the feedback is clear.  But... AITA for making a post to ask input on /r/games after /r/asktransgender was mostly offended?",Asshole
AITA for pranking my ex husband to win a bet with my FWB?," 

I was married to my ex Josh for 7 years. We divorced when he got his co-worker pregnant. They got married and from what I knew they were happily married. 

Recently, I met Josh at an event. He looked sad and miserable. Apparently, his mom had passed away and that he was in debt. I work for am insurance company so I told him to reach out to me if he needed any help. 

I attended the event with Eric, my friend and told Josh that he was my co-worker. 

That night while we were hanging out, Eric told me that Josh was checking me out. I told him that he was crazy, and that he was happily married. 

Eric wanted to see if Josh would actually make a move. He dared me to make moves on Josh, and if Josh responded positively, I would have to do something nice for him, and if Josh responded in the negative, he would do something nice for me.

It was  a fun bet. So me and Josh started texting more, sometimes Eric would respond to the texts instead of me. It was a fun game for us. One day Josh ended up calling me when Eric was there, he was crying and told me that he wasn't happy. That his life was a mess. I told him not to worry, as per our bet, I told Josh that I still loved him . 

He knew my address, so as a final challenge, Eric dared me to text Josh to come over. So I did. Less than 4 hours later, Josh showed up with his bags, crying, his eyes were puffy. Apparently, he had just broken up with his wife, and came back to ""fix"" his mistakes


As soon as he said that, Eric came out of the room laughing, happy that he won the bet. I actually didn't realize how serious it was until Josh mentioned that his wife was pregnant. 

I did tell him that I was joking, and that Eric was behind some of the dramatic texts. He left saying that I was a horrible person.

"AITA for charging my daughter ""rent""?","I live with my wife and my daughter (12F). My daughter recently started babysitting for friends and family. It's her first job of any kind and she makes $5/hour.

I thought it would be a good exercise to teach her about taxes and fiscal responsibility if I charged her $1 for every $5 she earns. I pay for everything for her - her education, food, clothes, extracurricular activities, etc. This isn't about her paying me back though, it's just to teach her a general life lesson. She has no real need for the money anyways, maybe once in a blue moon she'll go to a movie with her friends or get some lunch for example.

I said that the $1 for every $5 is her ""rent"" that she will pay to me at the end of each week. Well the end of the week came, and she broke down crying as I tried to take $12 from her (she babysat for 12 hours that week). I felt bad, but also wanted to stick to the decision I made and am hopeful that she will ultimately take something away from the experience. She refused to give me the ""rent"" so I went into her room and took it from her piggy bank. I explained how the IRS does the same thing in real life but isn't so nice about it, and that this is a learning experience.

She broke down into hysterics and my wife started crying as well. My wife has since calmed down since I helped to comfort her, but my daughter will not talk to me. I am starting to question my tactic, but also think it will instill bad habits if I reward her crying when I am trying to teach a lesson.

AITA for charging my daughter $12 in rent?

INFO: My wife does not work, and I also have a 10 year old son. So currently I am supporting four people by myself. I am hoping to encourage my daughter to ""chip in"" (even though as of now it's almost nothing) just to instill that value, rather than have her freeloading even though she is earning a salary

EDIT: I appreciate the comments, and people are correct that she is not ready to contribute to the household. I'm going to get her to stop babysitting since she is clearly not ready to earn a living, and in 2-3 years I may re-instate the program. Thanks for the advice, everyone

EDIT 2: This did not go as expected. I will drop the program entirely after one more month of the arrangement so as to reach a compromise. I agree that she is currently too young to understand, and therefore the program as it stands is not able to fulfill its intended purpose. I will permit my daughter to continue babysitting, on the grounds that she saves the money and pays me a lump sum for rent when she turns 18, as then she will no longer be a minor.",Asshole
AITA for not believing my coworker about “chronic pain”?,"


I have a coworker in his mid 30s who claims to suffer from chronic pain. Frankly, I think it’s a load of crap. 

Some days he’s limping around the office or even calls in sick claiming he’s in too bad of pain to come into the office. He’ll be wincing and just sitting in his chair. He claims it’s from a botched surgery. Somehow he’s been granted FMLA. 

There are plenty of other days though when he’s walking around just fine, even talking walks in the park across from our office or standing around at a coworker’s desk laughing while they talk. 

I’ve made comments like “Gee, you look like you’re really hurting!” on those days and he just says “I’m having a good day. They happen.”

Recently he started using a cane as a prop, which is when I confronted him. There’s no way it’s legitimate need. 

I asked him just how bad his surgery was that now he needs a cane, adding that it was taking the act a bit too far. 

He pulled up his shirt and revealed a dinky little 4” scar near his waist. I said laughed and said “That’s why you’re stumbling around?”

He replied  “This is the outside. I hope you get to feel what I feel, asshole.”

Then he shuffled away with his cane and next thing I know I’m getting talked to by our boss about how I’m treating Mr. Pain and that it’s inappropriate. When I told my boss I knew he was faking, he told me “his doctors know more than you” and that if I ever voiced doubt about the coworker in the office again, I’d be looking for a new job.",Asshole
AITA for being upset with my mother's birthday gift for me?,"throwaway so that people can't find my main account

So it was my birthday on the 10th, and I went over to my mother and father's house to celebrate. I was excited to be turning 34 because that has been my favorite number since I first read The Count Of Monte Cristo (my favourite book), because that is  Edmond Dantè's number when he is imprisoned in the book.

I figured that because it was my favorite number birthday, my mother would do something really special. She made my favorite dinner, spaghetti and impossible meatballs, and baked cookies for desert. This was all well and good, but then the bad part happened. Yep, it was time to open my gifts...

My wifey gave me a slip of paper that said ""IOU One Playstation 5"", so I was pretty excited about that. My father didn't have a gift for me because he said he wants me to get a job to support my baby that is on the way (due in October!) before he spoils me any more. I was a wee bit miffed about this, but I haven't ever had the best relationship with him.

I had hinted extensively to mother that I wanted a Pop In A Box Stickered Exclusive Agent Venom Funko Pop that I could keep in the box to go alongside the one I already have, but when I opened the gift, it was just a painting of me as a baby being held in her arms. Mother has been getting into painting recently as she's been spending a lot more time at home due to being laid off from her job in May. While I did appreciate the sentiment, somewhat, the painting was a bit shite.

I told her that it would have just been easier for her to get me the Funko and she started to cry. She went off to her room and wouldn't come out, so my wife apologized to my father and we went home.

Now my wife is very mad at me, and my father says that mother hasn't been wanting to get out of bed for the past few days. I told him that she should have just gotten the Funko and he hung up on me and isn't picking up any of my calls anymore.

"AITA for ""making a scene"" at my older brothers creepy wedding?","My brother has always been a weirdo, never had any friends at school, was always running around working during the summer, I actually don't think he had a single friend at all when he was younger. He is adopted and we never really got along that much, he always had stupid hobbies like camping and shooting guns. Well apparently whatever he does for work was good money because he skipped college and moved up to Idaho when he turned 21. I went with my mom to visit him once, its literally a scene out of a horror movie, he built a cabin and there are old rusty trucks everywhere that he works on and spew smoke everywhere, chickens making noises, the road isn't even paved its just dirt and some gravel, its crazy trust me you would have to be there. Well when we where there visiting, he was babysitting these three kids of his neighbors, the oldest girl was 16 I think then? It was kinda weird but he seemed to be doing as good of a job as one would expect, but it was just weird. Well a few months ago we got an invitation to his wedding in the mail, and he is marrying the same girl. She is 18 or 19 now. Keep in mind my brother is 24. Much to my dismay mom made me go up there and ""celebrate"". Now, to his credit, he cleaned the place up a bit, the cabin is nicer and you could actually probably live in it, but he still drives this old rusty truck that is so loud it is defining to stand too close to it and you can smell it from a mile away. But damn let me tell you this wedding was weird. First off, the whole thing was in russian or something. My brother was adopted from there or something, but he never was ""russian"", it was super long and a lot of talking, they kept passing the rings around and stuff like that, and apparently they are some sort of weird culty Christians now? Like the really creepy conservative type... The wedding was on his land in a field which was also weird, like it was just a normal field and they just set up chairs and this alter that looks like someone hammered it together last night. Everyone was nice and all, but its like nobody cared that my TWENTY FOUR year old brother was MARRYING this girl who is YOUNGER than I am!!! Even my mom didn't seem to care. I kept my mouth shut until the dinner afterwords where I may or may not have accidentally drank too much of this weird homemade blackberry wine, and I just couldn't hold it in any more, so I guess I started screaming about how weird the whole thing was, like I was in an episode of the twilight zone where nobody but me noticed something was off. Anyways, now my mom is angry at me still and wont talk to me, apparently they had to carry me to the car and my mom drove us home early.

AITA for not eating my food after the mushrooms were picked out?,"I still live at home with my mum, so ofcourse I usually get fed by her most nights, although sometimes I do have a seperate meal if they're cooking something I don't like/can't eat.

For years, I have told my mum time and time again that mushrooms gross me out and that I hate the thought of them touching my food. Even if my food hasn't got any mushrooms in itself, if I know that mushrooms have been cooked in the same pan/dish I can't eat it. My mum loves them but I just can't stomach them.

Last night, she was on the phone and was asked what she was cooking. I could hear her from the other room and heard her say ""mushrooms, but I'm picking them out for ------"". I was furious. I knew she had done this in the past, and she knew I was grossed out and didn't want to eat my food. I took by bowl upstairs to my room, had a cry and a rant to my friend on facetime and came down a while later - untouched food in hand - and made beans on toast instead. According to my dad this morning, my mum had cried about me not eating her food.

From my point of view: it feels the same as if I was vegetarian or vegan and she had cooked chicken in the pot; it feels disrespectful that she wouldn't listen to my wishes for my food not to be cooked with mushrooms; I feel lied to and it feels like I can't trust her cooking anymore.

From what she says: she's been doing it for years and I never noticed; comparing it to vegetarianism is an overstatement; and that I'm being ridiculously stubborn on a non-issue.

I tried to explain to my dad that this is the same as if I spread something she didn't like (like ketchup) all over her food and wiped it off. He says he is staying out of it, but that I should have a talk with her when she gets home from work.

AITA?

Edit: a lot of people are focusing on the fact I cried. I've had issues with my anger and the way I express emotions for a long time. Mixed with mental health issues atm, the heathiest way for me to express myself is to cry rather than be violent or destructive (to myself or things around me). My mum cried too. We both cried. That is not the main issue here.

2nd edit: I spoke to my mum and asked that next time she makes something with mushrooms she should tell me before hand. She got aggressive and said really just won't buy mushrooms in that fucking passive aggressive kind of way and I said she was being aggressive. I told her I was genuinely sorry for the way I acted but she never apologised for lying about my food. I feel so fucking angry I can't believe I have to be the bigger person when talking to my own fucking mother. I'll probably edit this text when I'm less angry so please forgive me for being aggressive - it's still something I'm working on.",Asshole
AITA for yelling at my daughter for dropping a bowl,"A bit of context , my daughter is 14 years old with no disabilities whatsoever , however , she’s extremely terrible at her schoolwork and often get low grades. My wife and I always tried to help her but she just won’t listen to us. So today we were eating dinner and I asked her to put rice on the bowl. Now , I do all the housework in the house , I also made dinner and I have to go to work everyday , so I’m practically exhausted and very annoyed with everything. So when my daughter dropped the bowl ( it’s made of metal so it didn’t break ) ,  I shouted at her at cussed at her because she couldn’t do anything right in this house. She’s extremely lazy and all she does is play video games . She got really upset because I told her she’s basically useless which is the truth , and she just left the dining room and told us she didn’t want to eat anymore. I was furious because I spent so long making dinner and she’s being very ungrateful. My wife was upset too but somehow she’s angry at me? She told me I didn’t need to shout at my daughter but my anger was justified since I do everything in the house and she can’t even do one little thing right so I have the right to yell at her. I don’t understand why my wife is angry at me since she should be angry at my daughter for wasting food and making me angry, I’m sure that I’m not the asshole but I thought I’ll ask reddit anyway , AITA?

Edit : normally I am really nice to my daughter , usually it’s my wife who gets her to do work and she told me before how she liked me better because I won’t force her to do work all the time, I snapped because I was angry at her . I still don’t think I’m the asshole but from the overwhelming amount of comments telling me I am , I think I’m gonna have to talk to my daughter. I’ll post an update when we talked.

Edit2: I told her I’m sorry and I was just annoyed with work and stuff. She didn’t seemed convincing but she started to eat again so that’s good. I guess that I’m the asshole now because you guys don’t understand my family situation.
After reading some of your posts I’ve decided to go for therapy with my family and hopefully I’ll understand what I am doing wrong. Maybe it’s the way I’m bought up , My mother and father are extremely strict with me when I was young so maybe I don’t get the modern way of parenting.",Asshole
AITA for making fun of my MIL for not knowing how to write a check?,"I have a semi strained relationship with my MIL. Really we just have nothing in common but try to get alone for my husband's sake. I know she doesn't like me and she has made some snarky comments in the past, so I feel like I don't have to be super sweet to her. 

Recently MIL's friend was over (I don't live there but we lost power and I was using her internet for a school assignment) Her friend is big in the social/charity scene and was talking about a canceled event and how they are trying to raise money. MIL said she would do her normal donation, but I guess she didn't mean at that moment. Her friend was like ok you can give me the check and MIL got kind of uncomfortable. She asked me to help her in the kitchen and then told me she doesn't actually know how to write a check and her husband wasn't home.

I helped her with the check, but I was in disbelief that she didn't know how to write one. I guess I shouldn't be because this woman literally brags about the fact she hasn't worked in thirty plus years and that her husband ""takes care"" of her. After her friend left I told her that it is ridiculous that she can't write a check. She got really defensive and said it's ok because FIL doesn't know how to turn the stove on. I told her neither of those are things to be proud of.

She then said that maybe I have to know everything because my marriage sucks but she isn't planning on getting divorced. I know I was giving her a hard time but I feel like that was a low blow. I guess she whined to FIL because he bitched my husband out on the phone and said that I'm judgy and disrespectful and he never should have married me. 

I do think she is ridiculous, but everyone in the family teases and she has never gotten like this with anyone else.",Asshole
AITA for not letting my 16 year old daughter date?,"TLDR: Mature 16 year old daughter wants to date, I won’t allow it because as bad as it sounds, she’s a girl. 

I have a 16 year old daughter. She’s beautiful, does amazing in school, and is constantly  surprising me by how mature she is. 
I often ask her for her opinion in family matters she probably shouldn’t know about, but she’s always levelheaded and  gives pretty good advice. She’s only ever slipped up twice. I’m a devoted Catholic, and when she was 12, she refused to go to church and told us she didn’t believe in God. This hurt me and my wife deeply and I’ll admit, I yelled at her until she couldn’t talk anymore since she was crying. Not my proudest moment, but it happened. To this day she doesn’t believe in God, but the condition of her staying in our home is that she at least attend church with us. 
The second time she slipped up was when she was caught shoplifting. The cops let her go and there’s nothing on her record, and she said it was like an itch and she felt so terrible about it. I don’t let her walk around alone in stores anymore. In her defense, she’d been dealing with severe depression and mental health issues at that time. 

Now, the other day she comes to the living and sits down. She says she has something to talk to me about, and that she knew I wasn’t going to get mad. It looked like she was about to cry, but she said that she had met this boy who she’d liked for a year. Apparently, on New Year’s eve, he’d told her that he’d liked her for a long time and he really wanted to be her boyfriend. 
She said she wanted to let me know and that she really liked this boy. I generally am very strict, so my kids don’t go out much and aren’t allowed to date until I say so. Years ago, I said that the age when they could date was 16. She recalled this and said that she was 16 and she just wanted to get my permission first. 

I appreciate this, but I meant that my boys could date when they were 16. I love my daughter but she’s my only girl. I know she’s mature but women are easily manipulated and I just want her to be safe. I told her that I’m glad she asked, but it was a no until she graduated. I think she expected me to say yes, as her face dropped. She nodded but she’s the type to fight until the end to prove she’s right. 
She brings up how her brother dated at 16, and how I’d let her younger brother date at 14. 
She keeps this up until I am forced to say that it’s because she’s a girl. This clearly upsets her and she stands up to leave. But first she just says that she loves me but she’s disappointed. 

She’s still upset but I don’t think it’s that much of a problem. I’m not trying to be sexist, I’m just protective over my daughter. I know she’s smart and mature, but men can be dangerous, and I don’t want to put her through anything. 

EDIT: Okay, I knew I’d get a lot of “YTA” but that’s just how I was raised. It’s not that I think lowly of women, I just seriously don’t trust the boys out there. 
2nd EDIT: We are a Hispanic Catholic family. I raised my kids to have faith. I respect her choice to not believe in God.
3rd EDIT: Yes, my wife gets a say, but I am the final decision maker. My wife most likely thinks the same as most commenters here, but like I said, I’m the man of the house.
4th EDIT: Another reason I don’t want her to date is that she can’t drive. She has her permit, but she says she’s very nervous about reversing and wants to get more practice. Even if she had her license and a car, I wouldn’t let her. But our town is small, so you can walk to all the ‘hangout’ places.
5th EDIT( I should stop): Okay, I get it. I understand that at 16, she should probably be allowed to date. But it’s my house, my rules. We have a loving relationship, so I doubt she’ll just leave and never come back. ",Asshole
AITA for holding doors open for women?,"
19M here. I recently held a door open for a group of girls but not the men after. 

I live in the South, so this is how I grew up. This is what my parents taught me to do. When I did this though, a girl who I was with (she’s a friend) told me that what I had done was super sexist. 

After she said that, we got into a huge argument, and she called me sexist because of this. I mean personally, it’s just the way I’ve been raised - pretty traditionally. 

Does this make me the asshole?",Asshole
AITA for displaying a heirloom confederate battle flag in my private office?,"I have an antique confederate battle flag framed in my home office. The flag has quite a storied history. First carried into WWII by my grandfather, it was then carried into Vietnam by my uncle, who passed away a few years ago. They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views. The flag is a family heirloom, not a political statement.

My wife was hosting a baby shower for a friend of hers. Out of nowhere, one of her friend's guests stepped out into the living room holding the very same framed flag above her head. She claimed she was looking for the bathroom when she opened the door to my office by mistake (very unlikely).

Even when my wife explained the history behind the flag, she made a huge scene. During her rant about how her ancestors were slaves, she violently threw the frame on the ground, cracking the antique frame that had been in my family for three generations and sending glass shards all over the wooden floor. My wife's foot was cut quite badly by the glass, requiring three stitches. 

Long story short- cops were called, she was arrested, and charges will be filed. I have also retained a lawyer to go after her in civil court. As she works in the healthcare field, I am told a criminal record will be quite damaging to her career though it won't end it entirely. 

My wife's friend apologized profusely for her guest's behavior and has offered to pay for any damages (I thanked her but I won't make her pay for someone else's mistake), but she made a comment about how I was overreacting and that I shouldn't ruin a young woman's life over this. She also said my flag should be in storage or a museum, not out on display. 

I understand the outrage at display of the flag in public buildings, but I feel like this was different. I did not have my flag out in my front yard, it wasn't in my living room, it was in my private office, behind closed doors. Moreso, her irrational behavior caused my wife to be injured. I don't know if I would want someone like her working in a hospital setting. Am I an asshole for thinking this girl was way out of line? ",Asshole
AITA for getting my son out of trouble?,"My son Zach (16) goes to a very nice charter therefore public school where I'm an active parent as I volunteer a  lot and donate a lot of money. Okay, so Zach got into a heated exchange through text with another student. I don't know who started it, but as a  result of this feud, Zach outed the other student as gay on Twitter.

The other student printed out the tweet and showed it to the school. The school then decided to suspend my son for THREE DAYS, this would prevent him from playing any sports, do any clubs, and from doing any school activity for the rest of the school year (because of the added disciplinary points), this would also be on his permanent record .I don't support what Zach did because we live in a conservative suburban so I don't know how this will spread around (I also told Zach to take down the tweet) but I think the school acted completely out of step here. For one, the punishment here is way too harsh. Zach shouldn't be barred from playing football and baseball for the entire year, that's ridiculous. Also, I find it offensive that the  School would discipline my Son for speech that occurred outside of school, that's my job.

I got into an argument a wife about this, she said that it was imperative to learn from the school that what he did was wrong, etc. I told her that it was our job to do that plus this could severely impact his chances of getting into college, etc. So I proceeded. After consulting with a lawyer, and reading a lot on the internet I determined that indeed had a  case even if it wasn't a winning one.

I'm not going to skip describing every little detail about the very aggravating process I had to go through, but after threatening the school with legal action, no more donations, etc I eventually got them to reconsider Zach's punishment.  We both agreed that a suitable punishment for Zach would be two days of after school detention plus he would have to apologize, but he can still take part in school activities, but most importantly that this indiscretion would be expunged from his permanent record. I was very happy with this result.  Zach would still face school punishment but this wouldn't ruin his life.

I  thought my wife would be happy with this, but she was not. She is angry at me, she said that this punishment did not go far enough and taught Zach that he could get away with anything. I told her we she should discipline him in a way she saw fit and not rely on the school. We went back and forth got angry at each other. Also, I guess Zach was bragging about this ordeal because this situation spread around which led to the other student's parents coming to my house to yell at me and my wife. If it wasn't for our wives, the father and I would've gotten into a fistfight.

I've asked other parents what they think of the situation, it is divided but most generally agree with me and say that the school was out of line. But, my wife is still infuriated with me. AITA?

Edit 1: People here are acting like Zach didn't receive any punishment. He got punished by the school ( 2 days of detention) and his punishment at home has yet to be determined, but he will be punished.

Edit 2: please read edit 1. Zach is not getting off without any consequences

Edit 3: My wife and I have decided that along with typical punishments (grounding, taking away his electronics for 3 months), Zach is going to volunteer at a lgbt teen homeless shelter to better understand why what he did was horrible.

Edit 4: people that send me hatemail and death threats are getting reported. So don't bother.

Edit 5: There are two options, you guys can believe this post is fake or it's not. Pick the option that will cause you to not message me please. I won't read or respond in a receptive manner to your messages. Thanks",Asshole
AITA for going ballistic on my parents for drinking in front of me?," I (19m) have always had a problem against drinking. Ever since my best friend died of alcoholism at the age of 17 (drinking underage, I know) I made it a priority to never drink. I let my family understand my beliefs and to never drink in front of me. They respected what I had to say and for 2 years all was well. That was until I had my 19th birthday. Everything was cool, nothing was said and we all just had a great time. After a night of dancing, I went to the bathroom to relieve myself. When I entered the stall and did my business, a crash came from the door and entered 2 noisy people who at first notice, barely sounded like my parents (Yep...). While I got up and zipped up, I still heard them, shouting and hiccuping. The second I exited I just looked at them both. My parents were so out of their minds, they didn't even notice me. Well, the rest is history because I went ballistic on them, screaming so loud that I think the whole entire party heard it all go off. (After I finished letting off my cool at them, they fled to the car and left me there, probably embarrassed) I simply felt betrayed and just.. Words can't explain how mad I am. I trusted them with a promise and I just can't believe they had to just take a drink all of a sudden. Now what also haunts me is that they might of been doing this while I was asleep, gone from the house or out of town. I just don't want to see my family dying so early. Like, I feel as though I was too harsh on them, but at the same time I had tried to discipline them. I'm currently locked in my room, eating cheezits and pepsi while I wait for an apology.

AITA for taking a homeless person’s dog?,"I know the title sounds awful but please read the full story. Every time I walk to my gym I see this cute little dog looking miserable. The dog (it’s a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it’s been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fiancé and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn’t a toy and people shouldn’t get one if they can’t look after it. My mom says I’m cruel and don’t care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can’t take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she’s a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt’s family adopt her. We have two cats (they’re used to dogs) and we’re leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other and my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.

*For anyone wondering about the legality of what I did, my vet helped me out to make sure the dog was reported as abandoned and everything was legal. We’ll be able to make the adoption official after a 30 day wait period.*

UPDATE: as suggested by some of you in the comments, yesterday my fiancé and my brother went to talk to the homeless guy to let him know where the dog is and how to claim ownership. However, authorities ruled this as animal abuse, so if the guy does claim ownership he can face charges (the guy knows this as well). Typically the waiting period for us to adopt the dog if the owner doesn't claim her would be 30 days, but because this is a case of abuse we might be able to finalize the adoption earlier. Seems like my aunt will adopt the dog since they're a family of 5 and someone's always home to take care of the dog. I understand the people telling me I should have talked to the guy earlier and I was a coward for not doing it. For people asking about temperatures, my city is in the mountains in northern Europe, snow and sub-freezing temperatures are a regular occurrence here. For people telling me to return the dog because the homeless guy is lonely, animals don't exist for our entertainment and loneliness isn't a valid excuse for animal abuse. Plenty of homeless people care for their animals and don't leave them alone in the cold.",Asshole
AITA for telling my step daughter she acts like a slut?,My Step daughter is 20 and recently single. She always has been a social butterfly to put it nicely. Her boyfriend left her over cheating rumours which I wouldn't doubt for a second. My husband and I don't share the same views and she's his little girl which is fair enough but I feel like she's too out there.

As soon as the song started playing, my dad, who was sitting right next to me, told just me “rappers are saying “the n-word” and just making it harder on black culture”. I was completely furious how he could say this to me especially considering the fact that one of the families attending the party was black, so I stood up and called him out on it. Of course, all of our neighbors were completely mortified at my dads behavior and as a result we had to leave the party early.

AITA for using height increasing boots at clubs and on dates?,"Like most other straight guys, dating is hard. I started out like everyone else: getting friend zoned a lot and figuring out that in order to succeed in dating I only needed 2 things: 1) Be attractive. 2) Don’t be unattractive.

Losing weight, getting a better haircut, and paying attention to fashion got me better results than any weird tricks or confidence hacks I tried out. However by far the biggest jump in attractiveness was getting 4 inch height increasing boots. I’m shorter than average at 5’7” and at first I thought height didn’t make that much of a difference if I was just confident enough. Turns out, those 4 inches in my dating profiles and in real life made such a big difference in how girls respond on dates that I now believe height is the single most attractive quality for women. 

Recently, I was out with a group of friends and a shorter guy started asking me for dating advice saying he always sees me with new girls and he wanted to know how I do it. I told him that I use height increasing boots and that this made the biggest difference in my dating life. He proceeded to call me an asshole for lying to girls and that I should be ashamed of myself. He also called me pathetic and insecure for trying to compensate for my height with elevator shoes.

I smiled, nodded, and agreed to avoid causing any drama and made a note not to hang out with that friend again. That being said, is this really something that makes me an asshole? I’m  only doing it because height is such a noticeably big factor in attraction. Don’t see why it’s such a big deal to improve height when other things like losing weight or gaining confidence are seen as socially acceptable ways of self improvement.",Asshole
AITA for asking my sister to be discreet about her (Lesbian) relationship in front of the kids?,"My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My wife and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization.

It will be me, my wife, my daughter, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids’ ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, and her girlfriend are invited.

We initially only invited my sister, but my sister insisted that her girlfriend (who I think she's been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well.

My sister is in a lesbian relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances.

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

AITA for telling my wife that I want her to be a SAHM?,"(Some context): I’m American and my wife is Middle Eastern. Ever since we had our first child (8 years ago) we moved to her country. It was a mutual decision. I was raised by shitty parents and I have cut contact with all my family. She is very close with her family so I didn’t want her to be away from them. It makes me happy to see that the kids are growing up surrounded by loving grandparents and extended family, so it worked out perfectly for us. 

The only downside is that my wife brings in more money than me and it honestly doesn’t make me feel good. 

I received a really good job offer that is hard to pass. It pays way more than my current one. Unfortunately it’s in the US and that would mean we’d have to move there. It also requires many business trips. I told my wife I want her to quit working and be a stay at home mom instead. I explained that there is no one around I trust enough that will be able to take care of the kids so she will have to. She’s being stubborn though saying that being a SAHM just isn’t for her and that she loves working. But I know that there is no way she’ll be able to find a good job in America because of her race. 

Her parents have told me that I’m being inconsiderate and that I should even reconsider the move. However, I feel like I’ve sacrificed a lot and now it’s her turn. Does this make me an asshole?

My family went to my grandmas house where every cousin attended. I couldn't go because there was no room left for me in the car. 3 people and lots of Christmas packages.
Im literally crying as a write this. My older brother came to visit us before they left to Grandmas house. And its like its Christmas eve and not a single person in my family said happy holidays or merry christmas to me.
They came back and they told me how good the day was and how happy they are, and while im happy for them to be having such a great time, at the same time my older brother (24m) started hugging my younger brother and my mom while saying Merry Christmas to them while i watched on the sofa.
Anyway i ate my food (what they brought me) and then my mom says like ""David got even 3 presents"". And i(21f) was upset because like yeah that's great that you got presents but i got none. No one in my family, no one in my moms side or my dad side wished me anything.
When my older brother hugged my mom and younger brother i got upset because no one hugged me. My mom got upset because i went to my room and cried and she said that i was a TA because i was crying and that i ruined Christmas for them

But im crying because im the middle child who often gets forgetten and no one hugged me or wished me merry christmas.. And i know its stupid reason to cry but atleast ONE hug would be appreciated?

AITA for yelling at my girlfriend for eating with her hands in front of my parents?,"My girlfriend (22F) is Pakistani-American and culturally for her it's normal to eat with your hands. I understand and respect this.

I recently took her to meet my parents and I've been putting this off for a while. My parents are upper-class and sort of look down on lower-income people and are really big on politeness and ""professionalism"" and all that. As a kid they used to throw all these boring dinner parties where my brother and I had to sit for hours eating ridiculously rich food (think all the cliches) while the adults talked forever. My parents don't even like it if when they call my name I reply ""Yeah?"" or ""What?"". They want a ""Yes?"". I warned her about them and I said I really want them to like you, please just be polite and use a napkin. 

She agreed. We were invited for dinner so I brought her over and we greeted each other and went through all the basic pleasantries. I could tell my girlfriend was nervous. We sat down for dinner and my mom had made a few fancy dishes and I could tell she went out of her way to make everything as extra as possible, probably to intimidate her. This is, unfortunately, something they tend to do. I mostly ate the paella anyway. 

Dinner started and it was fine and everyone was polite. We talked except by about the middle of the meal, my girlfriend abandoned her fork and knife and started eating with her hands. My mom looked kind of shocked and angry and my dad seemed a little grossed out. Neither of them said anything but they both sort of clammed up after and my girlfriend kept eating. I tried nudging her, but she didn't seem to pay attention and ate the rest of the food with her hands. Dinner finished, my girlfriend washed her hands and then we sort of hurried to leave.

On the way home I had a big argument with her. I said I begged her to please use a knife and fork, I told her what my parents are like. She shot right back at me and started yelling I was disrespecting her culture and it's unfair for me to expect her to eat how I want instead of what she's comfortable with. I said when we visited her parents I asked her beforehand the right way to eat with hands and I ate the biryani they made with my hands, so wasn't she technically disrespecting *my* culture by eating with her hands? She sort of scoffed and stomped to her room when we got home. 

It's been two days, she's waiting for an apology and I'm still pissed off and not giving her one. In case I'm actually being racist here I don't want to ask any of my friends so I'm on Reddit. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for confronting my girlfriend’s creeper in front of his wife, possibly damaging their relationship?","My girlfriend [21F] and I are at a resort in the Caribbean. 

My girlfriend is objectively extremely beautiful. She is a high fashion model, and often gets compliments on her looks. Sometimes these are from creepy men.

Yesterday, my girlfriend was lounging by the pool. She noticed a young man who was also a guest staring at her. She got up to get something, and when she came back she found a note on her towel that read, “Just wanted to let you know, you look beautiful in that bikini. Enjoy your time here. —Tom.” 

she told me about it later, and immediately I suspected the staring guy. I look over and beside him on the lounge chair is a woman and a young girl, probably his wife/girlfriend and his daughter who joined him not too long ago. 

I waited until my GF was in the bathroom, and I went over to them as we were about to leave the pool. I also waited until the daughter went to play in the pool.

I went up to them asked, “Are you Tom?” The young man looks at me confused but his wife nods and says, “Yeah he’s Tom.” I hand him back the note and said, “Hey, my girlfriend is flattered, but leave her alone dude.”

His wife took the note from his hands, reads it, and gives him the most confused/hurt look. I left before he could say a word. I found my girlfriend afterwards and I told her about what happened. She got pissed at me and said I shouldn’t have done that, I could have just ruined that family’s vacation or worse. She said I at least should have waited until he was by himself, and not with his wife. I said I was doing his wife a favour by letting her know what a scumbag her husband is.

AITA for refusing a nicotine test for IVF,"So I'm (36m) and my wife (31f) are doing ivf.  We did the first round and it didnt take.  We have one frozen embryo left.  My wife has blocked tubes so that is why.  I always said and I will quit smoking when I have a child.  The first annoying part was the doctor who forced me to get a nicotine test.  I quit smoking cigarettes for 2 weeks and passed the test.  Thing Is that i enjoy smoking.  I have gone back to the juul which isn't as bad and stayed off the smokes.  Now here we are ready to do round two with our frozen embryo and my wife tells me this morning that I need to get another nicotine test.  I'm furious and dont want to do it.  Am I the asshole for being sick of doing this shit.  I know it's horrible but I'm not the problem here.

Edit: one of my main problems is authority.  I realize this.  The way I look at this is I volunteered the info that I smoke in order to find the best way to succeed with the IVF.  After I heard about the test i asked the doctor to not include that in her report to insurance.  She would not budge.  This makes me extremely angry because who does the doctor work for?  Me or the insurance company?


Please dont make this about smoking in general.  Please keep on topic where it pertains to this

Thanks everyone for all your help.  You have all made me realize that even though I would like a child now I really dont want one that much if I cant even keep  something that I enjoy.

AITA for Calling Out of Work?,"Since my last post got so much activity & my husband agrees with me I want to know if you think I’m the asshole here. 

I planned my first ultrasound for a Wednesday last week and it was amazing, we got to hear our baby’s heart beat and we will never forget that moment. 
Unfortunately, I had to call off of work to take the whole day and be able to see my baby. 
A coworker of mine his wife was having some pretty minor surgery and so I got overruled on the calendar for the day off because his was more important. My boss said I could just use my ultrasound as my lunch hour, but I wanted to take the day to embrace that first connection as a family. 
So I called out of work that day and apparently it left us very short staff and unable to perform surgeries until my coworker had left his wife resting at home and came in. 
My husband agrees that we aren’t assholes, that we deserved to bask in that bliss but my whole office is angry with me and said it’s definitely an asshole move. Nobody told my coworker he was being forced to come in. He volunteered. But tell me reddit, am I the asshole?

AITA for telling someone disabled they should leave the gym,"Throwaway for the usual reasons

I go to the gym a few times a week as it's something I enjoy. Yesterday I was there for the first time this year and there was lots of new people which is to be expected this time of year with people making resolutions they can't stick to.

Anyway I was minding my own business when I looked up and saw an overweight woman come in who had a walking stick, she also had who turned out to be her husband with her who looked like a gym regular. I saw her get on the exercise bike for about 20 minutes then she moved to the weight machines. Because of her disability she couldn't manage on and off the machines herself and her husband was helping her on and off between his workout. I was concerned about this and no staff were about so I went upto her and told her I think it's for the best she leaves the gym as she's clearly not able bodied enough for it (looking back now I should have worded it better). Her husband then came up and asked if everything was ok and I told him my concerns. He raised his voice slightly at me and told me to mind my own business as he's qualified in training different sports and she was in safe hands.

I then told them I don't think the gym management would be too happy at someone disabled and unable to get on and off the machines being in the gym. He told me his wife wasn't actually allowed to join the gym without a Dr's letter and also a meeting with the gym manager to come up with a plan for her to safety evacuate the building with the help of staff and all staff were aware of her problems.  At this point I realised they weren't going to leave so went back to my workout.

Today I told my friend what happened and he told me I'm an idiot who should learn to mind his own business or try encourage someone who's new to the gym. He doesn't attend the gym so I don't feel he understands the kind of environment she was in. He also seems to think my membership could be at risk for what I said",Asshole
AITA for getting angry at my S/O for her mistake that made me violently ill?,"For a bit of background, I live with a woman and a newborn right now. I have a severe egg allergy. I cannot eat anything containing eggs.

My S/O is supposed to know this, but despite being a great partner, she is often very forgetful. Last night, she had made cookies, and I wanted to try one. I asked her if there were eggs in them because I'm allergic to them, and she said ""I don't think so."" I asked her to clarify and she told me ""no."" 

I should have been clued in that she wasn't really listening because during this conversation she was staring at her smartphone. 

After eating some of a cookie, I got a terrible rash and stomach cramping. In this time she asked if I needed to go to the hospital, and I declined. I vomited multiple times and broke out into a bad sweat, and when I asked if the eggs had cookies, she told me they did. 

I was very upset with her and told her again that I'm allergic to eggs and that she could have killed me (maybe a bit of hyperbole). She responded that it was my responsibility to check the contents of the foods I'm eating because of my allergy. At this point I couldn't handle it anymore and told her that she has to be more responsible and start taking my feelings into account more, and she told me that she was tired of being snapped at, took the baby to the guestroom, and slept there. 

I may have come down a little hard on her. I feel terrible, but I'm wondering: AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my wife that she should find a more productive and less wasteful hobby?,"My wife's only ""hobby"" is makeup. She sits in front of her mirror for at least an hour a day putting makeup on, then washing it off, then putting other makeup on. I've always felt a little weird about this considering she only really does it at night when no one will see it and she doesn't even wear makeup to work because she doesn't want to get up earlier. I also don't love that her only hobby is pretty self centered and not productive or social at all. She also goes through makeup pretty fast and spends almost her entire ""fun budget"" on it. This creates a lot of clutter and a lot of waste in my opinion and she's not even getting anything out of it. It bothers me because I could, for example, play a video game forever without having to pay more, but she has to buy more and more eyeshadow or whatever. My hobbies are much more social or productive, even if I'm just playing video games with friends. I suggested recently that she expand to something that other people can appreciate more, like art, or something that will at least create less waste or be more social. She got really upset with me and told me that I just don't understand makeup and I have no right to judge how she spends her money. I pointed out that part of a relationship is trying to help each other grow and she called me judgmental and told me to keep my opinions to myself. So basically she just wants me to shove it.

AITA for asking my sister to throw my baby shower party when she is suffering from infertility,"this is a confusing one sorry

i 20 f am dating my sister Lucy's ( 28 f ) boyfriend (josh 29 m) of 3 ish years that she broke up with. i know there's a whole thing surrounding dating a siblings ex but please hear me out.

We live in relatively small village, it's a 10 mile drive to the nearest town, and i haven't got my drivers licence yet because I've been too busy with work and classes. Lucy and Josh started dating around late 2016 and got engaged in 2018.

Then in early 2019 Lucy found out she can't have children due to a problem with her ovaries. I don't know exactly what went on but after the infertility diagnosis Lucy became very depressed, she went on antidepressant medicine and started therapy.

A few weeks after starting therapy she and Josh broke up, mutually apparantly. Josh lives just down the road from us so i see him out and about on the farm quite often.

It just kind of happened naturally, we grew closer together and went on some dates, but then i fell unexpectedly pregnant but i kept it secret from Lucy because she is still very down and depressed.

In my opinion Josh can't just never move on, and someone shouldn't be forever off limits because your sibling briefly dated them.

So i decided after 2 months that it was time to tell Lucy, soon I'll start to show and I'm planning on moving in with josh before the baby arrives but shit . hit. the. fan.

She's living back at home now and has been since the break up, and she looks awful, she mostly slouches around in her pjs, i sat her down and said i have some news. i told her i was with josh and that im expecting,  i told her it would mean the world to be if she would be god mother to the baby and asked if she would like to plan the shower for me as i know she absolutely thrives on parties. 

She didn't even react, just asked me to leave I made the point that it's our parents house. I know on paper this sounds bad, it really dose but i should be allowed to live my life and so should Josh.

The baby was unplanned and something we couldn't have forseen, i know that is probably a bit of salt in the wound but i couldn't have helped a complete supprise. i love my sister and want to see her happy but she text me this morning saying this

: lucy : Thanks for letting me know your dating josh, oh and that your pregnant with his child, congratulations you achieved what i could not, i am in such a bad place and you will never understand, josh and i agreed i needed time and medication and then we would try again but i guess he never told you that did he.
as for your baby shower all i can say is well done,  you always were good at telling jokes.
i hope you rot in hell you evil bitch.

AITA for cutting my daughter out of my will for getting an abortion?," I have a daughter who I love dearly that is 29, she recently came to me and her mother and told us that she was 4 months pregnant. She said she didn’t know who the father was and that she had multiple people who thinks might be the father. From what I could gather, she doesn’t like taking birth control, and instead trust her partners to use protection. She works in one of my companies for which she gets paid competitively for what, I admit, is minimal work. When we talked to her we told her that we would of course support her in whatever she did, and while talking options we made clear to her that if she kept the baby we would support her financially and ensure that she would be able to spend as much time as possible with the child, especially since she might have been a single mother. She mentioned that she was considering getting and abortion, I told her that if she wanted to get an abortion she would have to pay for it herself, the implication being that I would financially support every option but that. She knows that I am personally not supportive of the practice, so I didn't need to make that clear to her again when she is obviously under a lot of stress. In the end I made sure that she understood that whatever she did, it would never affect the amount of love we have for her. I left my wife and my daughter to talk in private, after I talked to my wife and my only question was if it was consensual sex. My wife said she thinks it was, and she did ask. My wife and my daughter are close, she would have told my wife if it wasn't

A couple days after that she called me at an odd hour and when I asked about how she was feeling she told me she wasn’t pregnant anymore. I asked if she had a miscarriage, she said no, I asked if she wanted to talk about it, she said no. I told her to take as much time as she needs off of work, and that I would handle everything with her job

Onto the inheritance, I have told my kids that when I die all of my fortune will go to charity, I actually have set about 35 percent of my inheritance to them and their potential families. I didn’t tell them so they could keep motivation instead of waiting on my inheritance. My daughter was set to receive an inheritance but I'm considering taking her out since she got an abortion. My thought process being that since she did something that I don’t agree with morally, I don’t want to reward her with an inheritance from me. I would do the same for any of my kids if they did something similar

I also have a son and another daughter in high school. Both my son and my daughter work for my companies, and if they are responsible with their money they can be financially independent and retired long before I die.The inheritance goes from 3 million for each of them to about 4.5 million for my son and younger daughter

I apologize for the lengthy post

Edit: I read all the comments and I'd like to clarify a couple things. I am not religious, my daughter still has my emotional and financial support in addition to her job, and by the time I die all my children will be worth much more than what I give them (my children working for me are making well into 6 figures before bonuses, benifits, and stock options).

AITA for posting pictures of what my step daughter really looks like to her social media account?,"
My wife and I have a deal with our kids, if they have social media:
1. we need to be able to follow the account 
2. We need all login information, and updates when the login changes. 

Although it’s required, we rarely check their social media. We would like them to behave themselves as if we are watching. 

Recently we found out that my wife’s daughter (16) has a secret Instagram account. The Instagram account has around nine thousand subscribers. The pictures that she posts on this account do not look like her *at all*. They are highly edited and quite inappropriate. She looks 25, not 16. 

Wife and I took the phone when we found out. We have since gone through her messages to see A LOT of inappropriate messages, and the fact that she has done two sponsored posts recently.  We took the phone for a while as we were trying to figure out an appropriate punishment. 

I suggested that the account be shut down, and she can’t have a new one for a couple of months. Wife didn’t agree. It honestly seems to me as if she was proud of this. She didn’t take it seriously at all, and was dilly dallying about coming up with a punishment. I thought I’d take matters into my own hands, so I posted a series of pictures of her where she actually looks like a kid. School pictures, family pictures etc. She lost a few followers over a couple of days. 

When I gave her the phone back she had a complete melt down. She is acting like I ruined her life. She is talking about how she may not be able to do the sponsored posts and she is being bullied. I told her she can always delete the account. Wife found out and got very angry with me. She even told me that this was not a parenting job for me and I should have left her to deal with it. I have treated this child as my own since she was four. I think I have every right to parent her. Everyone is giving me the cold shoulder, and I feel like I’m going insane.

"AITA for insisting that my sister come to my housewarming party without her kid, even though she’s told me that she can’t find childcare?","Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So a little background:

About three months ago, I landed my dream job—I’m the first woman employee at a super prestigious engineering firm. The first thing I did with my signing bonus was buy this really awesome apartment in a great new neighborhood. It’s near a bunch of great restaurants and shops—I’ve been eating out at least twice a week since I moved in. Basically, I’m living the dream.

So onto the problem. I’m throwing a housewarming party next weekend to meet my new neighbors and make a good impression on them. I really want my sister Sophie (27F) to come. Sophie is a single mother to Mavis (4F). I like Mavis fine, but honestly, I’m not a huge kid person and I miss having my sister all to myself. We used to be able to hang out all the time, but now it’s always preschool this and swim class that. I’ve told my sister that I miss having her around and want to hang out separately, and she always responds with, “Look, I’m sorry, but my head is barely above water as it is. It’s hard enough to afford weekly daycare. If you really want to hang out, you could maybe come to Mavis’s [ballet recital/gymnastics thing/school play?] Sometimes I come, but I always feel super left out and end up leaving early.

I told my sister that for the housewarming party, I want it to be just her. No Mavis, no conversation about Mavis. Just me and Sophie, like old times. Before she had Mavis, my sister was super smart and awesome—she was getting her PhD when she got pregnant—and I want to show her off to the neighbors! Sophie, however, said that she’d like to bring Mavis along, as she’s been pulling double shifts at work and hasn’t really had any time to hang out with her, and also is worried about finding a qualified nanny (Mavis has significant anxiety and night terrors, so it’s hard to find a good babysitter.) 

I was enraged. I told her that this was my party to celebrate my achievements, and that I just wanted one night with her only, and for once not have it be all about “your damn kid.” (Those were my exact words.

Sophie got really upset and said that it’s either her and Mavis or nothing, that I need to stop clinging to the past, and that I should grow up and realize that I have a niece now who’d really like to get to know me. She left and we haven’t talked since.

My mom is really upset with me, but my friends are telling me to stand my ground, and that it was about time that someone said something.

I don’t think I’m in the wrong here. AITA?

EDIT: Childfree party. Just got new designer furniture, and I’d have to put plastic over it if kids came, which just sounds like a ton of work.

EDIT2: Offered to pay for nanny, she said no. She said she wasn’t comfortable accepting something so expensive, and that she just wanted to see her kid after a long and hellish week. Apparently she and Mavis have a tradition where they watch Frozen together every Saturday night. I told her she could reschedule, she said no, she’s missed her kid. Then we fought.

EDIT3: Sooo....Sophie found this, apparently. Looks like as of now my sister has cut me off. Classy, Soph. You couldn’t have at least not done this here?",Asshole

I'm 22M dating a 26F. I had a crush on her for a while, she's really pretty and funny, and we get along great. About a month after we get together, her dad gets diagnosed with cancer. 


I have no frame of reference for dealing with sick people. I have never met her dad, and we are newly dating. About 5 months in, her dad gets pretty sick. During that time, she asks me if I want to meet her dad, and I tell her no, because I think it's way too soon. 


We're together for 6 and a half months when her dad dies. Naturally, she's a wreck. She's looking to me for support, but we've only been together for a short period of time. I don't want to help her plan a funeral and talk to family members I've member met before. 


I told her that I'll check in on her while she's planning, but I won't stay with her or help her plan. I also remind her that she has lots of friends who have known her longer than me who are really supportive. She says she is disappointed, but understands, and is fine as long as I come to the funeral. 


The day of the funeral comes, and, I just can't do it. I'm in my car, in my suit, and I just can't go in. My phone is blowing up from texts from her, texts from our friends, phone calls, and I just can't do it. I wind up not showing up. 


We talk later that night. She is really upset and says she can't believe she had to go through the whole event without my support and worrying about where I was the whole time. I felt bad, but reminded her again that we haven't been together for that long, and she had her brother and friends there. 


She calls me an asshole and tells me she needs time to think. It's been about a week now and I haven't heard from her. I think both of these decisions are rash. I don't think I'm an asshole, I just think I'm young and don't know how to deal with death. 


So tell me, AITA?


Edited: Ok, I guess the verdict is out, I'm an asshole. I still disagree, but I'll accept my judgement. For all those calling me vermin, or wishing the end of my relationship, I hope you develop the empathy you're telling me I clearly lack and realize that people can make the wrong decision when they are under stress and faced with a situation they have never dealt with before.

AITA for telling a stranger that I strongly suspected he had skin cancer?,"This happened about a couple of weeks ago, but the event has been playing non-stop in my head since then, so my memory of it is still very vivid. I will try to retell the story in a matter-of-fact manner, and let you guys be the judge.

About 2 weeks ago, I dropped by Subway to grab a quick lunch. It was extremely crowded, and all the people in line had to stand uncomfortably close to one another. Because of the proximity, I couldn't help taking notice of the man in front of me. Judging by his appearance, if I really had to guess, I would say that he was probably in his late 20s, perhaps early 30s. He looked well-groomed, and had a very fit physique -- it was obvious that he was someone who took good care of his health. He also looked like he spent a lot of time in the sun, judging by his conspicuous tan lines.

As I was letting my mind wander while waiting for my turn to place my order, I suddenly noticed that he had a few moles behind his right ear. One of them struck me as looking very abnormal -- it was asymmetrical, irregularly shaped, and seemed to have patches of dark brown and black. Even though I am not medically trained, I have seen enough pictures of melanoma to strongly suspect that he might be afflicted with skin cancer. He might not have noticed the unusual-looking ""mole"" himself, since it was located behind his ear. 

I was debating with myself whether to give him a word of caution. On the one hand, I did not want to come across as invasive and socially awkward; but on the other hand, if he was indeed ignorant of skin cancer risks, then he would probably appreciate knowing that he had at least one melanoma on his body. I began to imagine myself in his position -- if I were him, I would definitely want to know. Besides, as I said, he looked like someone who cared a lot about his health, so chances were even better that he would be grateful. I picked up my courage and tapped him on his shoulder.

Me: Excuse me.  
He: Yeah?  
Me: I don't mean to be rude, but... I noticed that there is a spot behind your ear that looks like a patch of skin cancer cells.  
He: What?  
Me: *(thinking that he didn't hear me correctly)* I noticed that...  
He: Are you a doctor?  
Me: No, but one of the moles on your ear highly resembles a melanoma. I have seen many pictures of melanomas, and I strongly suspect that you have skin cancer.   
He: Again, are you a doctor?  
Me: No, but, as I said...  
He: So no, you are not a doctor.  
Me: No.  
He: Well, since you are not a doctor by your own admission, you really should mind your own business instead of fear-mongering.

He then hastily turned around, clearly wanting to end the conversation. I was embarrassed, and, to be honest, annoyed that my good intentions were punished with chastisement. I later told a friend about what happened, and she called me an asshole for being presumptuous.

We parked and my gran went to the toilet, and i needed a box of tea from the store. So we went in, and left the dog, which dog is fine with.

And it is not ok with me for her to sleep with her boyfriend in my household. During these visits, they must sleep separately in different bedrooms and I have a strict open door policy, and they must not partake in activities that may lead to sex. Just to repeat, while It’s not what I believe I do not have issue with what my daughter does in her own home. But my daughter is not happy with these rules. She said she can’t just put a halt on her relationship every time they visits, but In my opinion if you cant handle a month without being fucked by your boyfriend then that really says something about the kind of person you are. This was the last fight and she has now left the house and went to stay in a hotel instead. I am disgusted to know she would choose to do this. AITA for not allowing them to sleep together?",Asshole
AITA For giving my friend a necklace that my long ago crush bought me?,"Repost because in my last post I asked people to upvote only if they comment nta which broke the rules. Sorry for sounding bossy and u can do what you want this time. Apparently i am also not allowed to delete active discussions (rule 4) so I won't be deleting this post even if it doesn't go the way I expect or blows up.

Almost a year ago, I received a  necklace from a guy in my class as a gift. It wasn’t my birthday and we  aren’t friends or anything so it was kind of awkward but I thanked him  for it. I am a type of girl that doesn’t really like to wear jewellery  (I find them uncomfortable) so I never ended up wearing it.

3  days ago it was my friends birthday, she usually celebrates her  birthday but because of the pandemic she ended up not doing it this  year. Even if she didn’t throw a birthday party, I still wanted to gift  her something. I ordered a necklace 2 days before her birthday. It was  supposed to arrive the same date my friends birthday was but they called  me and told me they couldn’t make it that day anymore. This obviously  upset me because I had to give my friend something and I couldn’t wait  any longer so I cancelled the order. I still wanted to give my friend  something though and I decided to just give her the necklace that guy  gave me almost a year ago since I never wore it.

Yesterday,  I don’t know how but my friend found out that the gift I gave her was  the gift that guy from class gave me. She got really upset and told me  “Why would you give me something another person gave you as a gift. This  is so wrong and you just hurt me and your crush. I hope you feel good  about yourself.” I tried talking to her but she ended up blocking me. I  tried telling my other friends to tell her to unblock me and text me but  it didn’t work. I even tried interrupting the online class (I told her  that she needs to stop playing the victim and appreciate the fact that I  still gave her a gift when I didn’t have to) but she wasn’t responding  and the teacher told me to shut up. So yeah… she isn’t talking to me.

I honestly don’t think what I did was wrong. I know I didn’t give her a  brand new gift (which I have an excuse for), but I don’t see it wrong to  give her something that’s mine but don’t like. AITA?

tl;dr:  I gave my friend a necklace that I never wore but she got mad that I  didn’t buy her something brand new instead and now stopped talking to  me.

AITA for being pissed at a girl who wouldn’t take off her shirt?,"I was playing truth or dare with one of my friends when she came over and we got a bit drunk. She dared me to take off my shirt and dance while she rubbed Nutella all over my chest. I later dared her to do the same thing to which she said no. I told her that it’s unfair that I have to do that and she doesn’t. She said since she’s a girl she’s exempt from it and I’m not. I told her that she’s being sexist and I wouldn’t play with her anymore if she was going to be like that so she eventually let me.

AITA for telling my daughter her boyfriend doesn't have a good job?,"While I very much dislike my daughter dating a man old enough to be her father, I have found yet another issue with him. I spoke with my daughter about him and asked what his job was. She said, like her, he's a delivery driver. I thought I raised her to be better than this and I told her that is not a real job. I always taught her to look for a nice young man with a good office job, not a man in his 40's with a job for teenagers.

If he's stuck delivering things now, it obviously means he has no real skills. I'm trying to break them up and find her a nice local boy her age with a better job.",Asshole
Aita for telling my kids that I’m dating their aunt?,"Edit: my mom, my sister, nephew, and our friends all gave us their blessing. 
It’s a lot less weird than it sounds, we didn’t grow up together and I met her 16 years ago when she was 18 and I was 28. 

She helped us move to America by putting her life on hold and helping us come to America 12 years ago. My ex-wife (mother of my three kids) and I were still together at the time. In return, I didnt have money and she didn’t ask so I let her stay with us in the spare bedroom in our house. She watched our kids grow up, sometimes watching after them. She is also the godmother of two of my kids. My oldest (used to-not so much after I told her) think of her as her big sis test. She is my second cousin so she has nieces and nephews that are closer by blood to her than my kids, and she always said she loves my kids more. 

Recently she came back from England where she moved after she bought herself a engagement ring “from” her boyfriend of one month. They got divorced. Her and I fell in love. 

My middle daughter came to stay with us (her and I bought a house) after a a fight with her mother (all my kids live with the mother except the oldest is now in college). My cousin thought that we need to make our relationship official and tell my daughter. I did (and told her not to tell her mother cause her mother won’t understand) and she did not want to stay with us and I barely speak to her since. I thought it was a childish reaction, I’m a free American adult I can do as I please. 

My oldest came back from college. I told her as well and she’s been pushing away from me too. Her mother told me barely eats (she’s on the larger side so this is weird for her) and just stares into space. She doesn’t seem like she really wants to speak to me although when I texted her she said “eveything is fine”
I am a free man. I have the right to do what I want. Plus, my daughters are complete Californian liberals. Shouldn’t they be tolerant of my choices? Should I have fallen in love with her and then held back because my daughters might disapprove (which I think is ridiculous)? I want to fix my relationship with them because their mother is a psycho. Example: my youngest daughter had a seizure so her mother didn’t want her to come with me to spend New Years in the mountains without her accompanying us (saying id be getting drunk and everything —I’m a responsible father I can drink once in a while) and I told her she can go to hell because it’s not fair that I don’t get my daughter for New Years alone. 

Edit: my oldest daughter said she feels that way bc of her mother not even the incest but her and I are divorced 5 years 
EDIT: please focus on the daughter aspect, I need to fix my relationship with them and explain everything to them because their mother is an insane bitch.

AITA for not changing my behaviour or making accomodations for my girlfriend?,"My gf of three years has some pretty bad anxiety around weird and specific things, and I feel like I shouldn't have to change my way of life to accomodate them. She is on medication for her anxiety, and she does work through her issues slowly, but when one thing is resolved it seems like another just pops up. 

Some things she has anxiety about that affect me include:

* anxiety surrounding food: she doesn't like to eat in front of me (she had ednos in the past and now has some left over anxiety) so if I eat before I get home and don't stop to tell her, she probably won't eat a full meal and will just snack. 
* she clams up when we go to my parent's house and food is involved: my parents will always cook for me if I go home to visit them with her, but she is vegetarian and they don't cook vegetarian. this links back to the first point, as this means she won't eat anything at my parent's house if I eat there. 
* she gets upset if I don't tell her I'm going out: sometimes I go for a beer with my friends for a few hours after work without telling her, and she says she's worried. I think this is really dramatic. 
* she gets anxious when I don't tell her the full details of plans: we have the same friend group but I often make the plans because she gets nervous asserting herself, and she gets anxious if I don't tell her every little detail. 

She argues that it would be 'easy' for me to accomodate these changes. She argues with the first two points that if I just texted her I was gonna eat before I got home, she could sort herself out. I think this is dramatic, I don't want to have to stop driving for a few minutes to text her during rush hour before I get my food. With the second point she says I could let her know beforehand if I'm gonna eat there, or tell my parents that we're gonna eat after. I think this is dumb, because I don't know when I'm going to be hungry, and it's not my fault my parents won't cook vegetarian. 

I find her last two points just controlling. I don't get why she has to know everything. She says that she doesn't get why it matters, because it would make literally no difference to me for me to tell her I was going out. I think this is dramatic, sometimes I just want to hang out without worrying. Sometimes I don't tell her things just because they'll make her nervous, but then she finds out and just gets upset.

AITA For refusing to teach my nephew how to drive after I got paid to do so?,"I am 33 years old and my nephew just passed his written drivers test  and now has his permit. Unfortunately my brother and his wife work a lot of hours and don't have much time to help him, so my brother offered to pay me to teach him.

I gladly accepted and my nephew is an awful driver, and I don't mean in the sense that he gets nervous sometimes and hits the brakes too quickly, I mean he can be full on reckless. He will go 90 mph on the highway, he almost hit a guardrail once when trying to merge, and he doesn't even listen to my advice.

I always have to keep telling him to put his turn signals on but he actually argues back with me and says he doesn't need to if there are no cars nearby. I really feel like I have no control so I refused to teach him any more. 

Now understandably my brother is mad because he did pay me upfront. I told him that his son drives like an Asian. My brother basically said I am the teacher and I am being paid to give him practice regardless if he is doing bad or not, but I basically retorted that it be one thing if he was a bad driver but tried to learn and do his best, however I am getting no where with him and that's not my fault",Asshole
AITA for being mad at my friend for who he tried to set me up with,"Hey everyone,

M23. Student at a good law school. Did my undergrad at a top university. And before anyone asks, I am not rich, my parents grew up in poverty.

I consider my to self to be sucessful, at least for my age, and generally have strong moral values (don't drink, party, am a virgin, etc) and am looking for a partner who shares similar values. All my friends know this.

So a friend of mine M27, tried to set me up with a mechanic he knows, despite her being not a virgin and obviously being less successful (nothing against tradespeople, I just want someone with similar levels of success)


He kept pushing this, saying that since she was a ""good person"", it is somehow a fair deal (even though he considers me to be a ""good person"" so therefore he doesn't know how to balance a scale""). 

What makes this worse is that recently I was rejected by a girl who was everything I ever wanted, and no one harped her into lowering her standards or that she should date me cause ""I am a 'good person'""",Asshole
AITA for standing up to my transphobic SIL?,"I am a trans woman who is in her third year of university studying for sociology. I came out to my family last year, I wanted to come out sooner but was afraid because they are a very religious and conservative family (think Trump supporting Nascar fans). It wasn't that bad, other than the constant dead naming.

But I could tolerate that. The real problem comes to my SiL. Some information about her. She was in a car accident when she was in middle school and is now in a wheelchair. My brother started to date her after asking her out to a dance in highschool, I'm believe he did it out of pity and went on dates with her because he's a nice person and didn't want to let her know he wasn't interested in her. They got married and he went to start a successful business. She started working in the business with him when he first started it, but I really wonder how much she really did because she now doesn't have anything to do with it. She just stays home all day and does nothing but watch TV, hang out with some of her girlfriends and just waste time not doing anything of value. My brother defends this unproductive behavior by using her surgery 2 years ago as an excuse for her not being able to leave the house. It was TWO YEARS AGO!!!!

On to the incident. Right now I am staying with my parents after the whole COVID thing. And my brother and his wife visit and they are talking about how everyone is so negatively affected and how the job market is difficult for everyone. This is where I said I was grateful that I would always have a job in a successful business with my brother. This is where my SiL had the audacity to say that I didn't. He looks at her and she gives him these eyes and he says to me that I didn't have a relevant education to what the job required and that I needed to ""figure out something for myself for once"". This DOESN'T sound like my brother at all, growing up our parents taught us to always have each other's back. I am sure she poisoned him against me. I know she hates me because I am trans. Not only doesn't she respect my gender identity, she also thinks that I'm a psychotic narcissist. How do I know? I saw her activity on Facebook and Twitter agreeing with JK Rowling, parroting TERF rhetoric and posting pseudo scientific studies showing the prevalence of personality disorders among trans women....

So this is where I might be the asshole. I was a little bit mad and I said something along the lines of this to my SiL ""You are just a gold digger who is living off of my brother's good graces. (I could have added crippled, but I would never stoop that low). Get a job or go live in the streets."" I admit, this was a little bit mean, but she provoked me into it. After I said this no one in my family wants to talk to me, my parents are telling me that I have a week to move out. I think this is all an over-reaction for something that I said and wasn't even that bad. And what more, it is pride month. Shouldn't they be a little more understanding of everything I have gone through? AITA?",Asshole
AITA for trying to evict my wife from her own house?,"My soon to be ex-wife had far more money than me going into our marriage, and for multiple reasons, she wanted a prenup to protect some assets and particular business interests, which I had no problem with at the time. The most relevant result of this is that the house we live in is not considered a marital asset. 

She rarely talks about her ""professional life"" preferring to ""keep it separate"". I have learned some of the truth about her business dealings. In her day job, she supports things that are honestly disgusting that I'm on the complete opposite political side of. There are certain protest worthy things that couldn't happen without direct action from her team where she works. In her side hustle, she is arguably a slum lord.

I've tried talking to her about it, and she just says that she does what she does for stability for herself and her family, and while she doesn't necessarily agree with things, she knows when to ""shut up and put it away"". She says she knows what happens when a woman and a mother is unstable and would swallow a lot to never know or have her children know the feeling. 

I'm just...sick. This is truly evil, and she doesn't care. She's never cared. She's 7 months pregnant with our first, but i need a divorce. I can't stand the idea of my children being influenced by her at all. In my state, you can file for divorce during a pregnancy.

The problem is that she has almost all the money, and the house. This is a high COL area, and I have no credit history due to bad education, so if I leave her as is, I have to move in with my parents, who live almost an hour away. There is no ""get an apartment nearby"", even if I somehow got enough money to pay the rent around here. 

If I can't somehow get the house, I won't be able to get custody at all and will have to surrender my child to be solely raised by her. I am currently working with a lawyer to see if the prenup can be overturned (literally the only option). Her family hates me, my family thinks that I'm the bad person now for not only ""leaving my woman"" (regardless of what she actively does) but for trying to kick a pregnant woman out of her own house. I'm just trying to save my child. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for asking my gf not to cook food in the same pot she cleans (sterilizes?) her menstrual cup in?,"Hello

My new girlfriend uses a diva cup for when she’s on her period. I’ll admit that I’m totally clueless when it comes to these things and I asked her how she cleans it, like washing machine, hand scrubbing, or whatever else. She said that she wipes it off, scrubs it, and then throws it in a pot and boils it. And I was like, oh so do you use a separate pot for this or does it come with a pot for this use. And she says nah, she just uses one of her cooking pots for this purpose.

Look, I’m not a germaphobe by any means but I just won’t eat off a dish that a cat or dog has licked or touched. I’m just not for it. And to me this isn’t much different and it made me hella queasy. So I told her that I don’t feel good about that and asked if she’d consider using a separate pot. I also made it clear that if it’s not something she can afford then I’d be willing to cover the cost. 

She wasn’t even the least bit receptive to my idea. She actually had the nerve to say that I’m being childish, that it’s “clean” and that I should just get over it

This pissed me off, I told her not to insult me like that and I told her to get out of my apartment. I don’t think I was being unreasonable in any way, shape or form and I feel like it’s an easy compromise. 

AITA?

ETA: Wow this post got a lot more attention than I thought it would. Anyways I thought y’all would like to know that Shelby apologized for calling me childish, I apologized for kicking her out of my place. She said she talked to her friends about it who told her that I’m not at all being unreasonable and that’s it’s not such a huge compromise for her (wow, who would have thought?), so I’ll be heading to SuperStore tomorrow to buy her a new pot for her washing duties. Jokes on you all, you’re all assholes.

AITA For distancing myself from my best friend after his extremely misogynistic word choice?,"Sam(Let's go with that name) and I have been really close friends since middle school. So when his ex and him got together back in high school, I obviously got very close to his ex too. While we aren't as close as I was to Sam, we had tonnes of things in common. We are both women in tech companies who love working out and have a lot of shared experiences.

Now, Sam got cheated on by his ex of 12 years. I was devastated when I came to know that his ex had cheated on him with multiple partners over a time period of 7 years. I can't imagine what he is going through right now.

It's only been a week since Sam got cheated on and we went to the bar together and I attempted to console him. Unfortunately, during this process...he let out extremely sexist words. He called his ex a b\*tch and a wh\*re. Aside from this, he also called her a c\*nt and told me that he had to try his hardest to not slam his fists at the door or throw things at her when he came to know of her betrayal.

This honestly freaked me out, because I never imagined  Sam as a guy who would be shitty enough to throw things at women. His derogatory language made me really uncomfortable and I told him that he had to become a good human  being again if he wanted to continue being friends with him. I don't want to be friends with someone who refers to women like that.

Just wanted some extra insight, that would help!

AITA for enforcing my daughter's roommate contract?,"Hi Reddit! I’m in a 55 year old lawyer (female) and I need some clarification about an incident that recently occurred between my daughter (21) and her roommate (also 21). They are both in their senior year of college. For story’s sake, we’ll call my daughter Melody and her roommate Claudia.   

When they moved in together at the beginning of the semester, my daughter and I decided to make a roommate contract for them. My husband and I make the monthly rent payment, and Claudia is responsible for sending us her half of the rent. We asked early on that she send it within ten days before the end of the month to make sure everything’s in order (she has been very good about sending it on time, even over holiday breaks, though she has been two days late a few times).   

The roommate contract was not only to make sure rent was paid on time but also to outline cleaning duties and ensure the comfort of both Melody and Claudia. Here’s where things got sticky. Claudia has a boyfriend and Melody told me he’s been staying over at their place a couple nights a week. Melody and I were both uncomfortable because if she needed to leave her room when he was staying over, she’d have to pass Claudia’s bed behind the divider in the living room and would sometimes hear him/see him. Because of that, I drafted up an addendum to the contract saying that he could only stay over a maximum of two nights a week including weekends and that Claudia had to inform Melody at least a few hours before he came over.   

I thought this was completely reasonable. However, one week ago Claudia had her boyfriend over four times (DOUBLE what the girls agreed upon). Naturally, Melody was extremely upset and called me sobbing. I decided the only fair thing to do was to terminate Claudia’s part of the lease a month early. I gave her two weeks to move out, which even then felt too long knowing my daughter’s discomfort. She also left the bathroom disgustingly dirty (multiple times)!   

I’m posting because Claudia and her parents have all reached out to me asking for more time. The girls’ lease isn’t up until March and Claudia isn’t moving into a new place until then, also she claims she is taking the LSATs in just a few days and needs to study. Her family lives several hours away by plane but my daughter said Claudia’s talked about an uncle in their city, so it’s not like she would be out on the streets. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable by looking out for my daughter’s wellbeing, but Claudia and her family seem to think otherwise. AITA?",Asshole

I just gave her the hard truth and told her she should’ve been more financially responsible then maybe she wouldn’t be in so much pain right now and I hung up. Later when my wife came home she just blew up at me. She said even if she as an adult we are still her parents and it’s okay to rely on us when she really needs it.

AITA for tipping less due the way the waitress was dressed?,"Hey everyone,

So when I normally dine out, I tip 15% of the pre-tax bill, as is the standard in Ontario. (For context, our prices don't include tax, minimum wage is $14 / hour (even for tipped employees), and tax is 13%). I've never been in a situation where I tipped someone less, and have tipped up to 20% at times.

Today however, I decided to only tip 12%. This was because how the waitress was dressed. Now it wasn't a fancy restaurant or anything, but I felt the waitress was dressed inappropriately for a casual family restaurant. She was wearing a company T-shirt along with a leggings-sweatpants hybrid. They were grey and kind of looked like sweatpants, but were really tight (clearly showed the outline of her behind, including the crack) (more revealing than your typical yoga pants). Since I felt she was dressed inappropriately, I reduced her tip to 12%.

Not sure if it is relevant, but she was actually on the same bus as I was on my way to the restaurant, where she was wearing the same pants and a crop top. So she was able to go to the back and change her shirt into a company shirt, but didn't change her pants.

AITA for reducing her tip?

Edit: Is actually too much to ask in the modern era to expect waiters to wear a proper pair of pants? Sweatpants and leggings are both inappropriate on their own I feel for anykind of job, or even out an about outside of a gym.

Edit 2: Tipping is for service, and part of the service is to expect someone to dress appropriately for their job.

Edit 3: Would your judgement stay the same if someone reduce the tip for a man wearing sweatpants?

WIBTA if I don’t get my daughter in law Taco Bell for her birthday as she requested and instead got a traditional cake for the treat?,"My daughter i law and I have a spotty relationship at best. I feel I work hard to get along, she accuses me of interfering with her kids and family (if buying her kids school supplies are a bad thing...then I’m guilty). 

So basically my son called me and said that Cassie would like to bury the hatchet this year and actually invited me to the birthday party. I asked if I could bring anything. He said if would be a big help if I stopped and got a Taco Bell party pack on the way over since Cassie wants Taco Bell instead of a cake and they don’t have one within 30 minutes of their house. I asked why Taco Bell and he said that Cassie is back on her “caveman diet” and Taco Bell is a treat but not like a sugar implosion like a cake. I said I’d think about it. He asked me to please not make an issue of this and please just get Taco Bell. I told him I just can’t see depriving a party of a birthday cake. He said if I can’t just bring the Taco Bell, please let him know and he’d handle it. 

The issue is, I’m disgusted with the way she feeds her family. The kids have zero fun when it comes to food and they are what I would consider brainwashed. Oh the rare occasion Cassie let’s me watch the kids, they will have one chocolate milk and arent interested in kids foods like cookies and fruit roll ups.

 I feel like I would be giving into the nonsense if I bring Taco Bell and not a birthday cake. I make an amazing traditional chocolate cake and I feel it would make the other guests not think Cassie is so odd. And it will quickly be overlooked and I get to make my statement in a quiet and dignified manner and maybe even subtly nudge her in the direction of allowing her kids a normal childhood than that would be a good thing.

AITA for giving my son an ultimatum to leave the house?,"Hello, so I’m a 40 year old mother to two children, one is an 18 year old girl who is wonderful in every way. The other is my 16 year old son who is lazy, addicted to video games, and anti-social. 


He had also been fired from work. He was in the employee room chatting with coworkers, when one of them said “I have to go now, my parents are here to pick me up”. My son responded “that’s impossible, your parents are dead”. I don’t know why he thought that was funny, but that’s not how I raised him. It turns out that the girls parents were actually dead (no, my son was not aware).


I had confiscated all electronics from him because he was gaming too much (like until 2am on school nights and before his 6am work shifts). So I told him to write a new resume to start finding a new job. I allowed him to use my personal laptop to write his resume. I told him he had an hour, and if he didn’t finish it in that hour that he would have to use the public library.

He kept dragging it on by asking for help and saying he didn’t know where to start or what to put on it. I told him that was his problem and to use google.

After the hour he had maybe 1/4 of his resume finished. So I told him to go to the library and finish it there. He flat out refused saying “there are 5 computers in this house, there is no reason for me to have to go to a library when I can do it here.”

So I told him he has two options:

AITA for choosing a name for my daughter?,"Hello Reddit. At the beginning of October I (33F) had my daughter (0F) with my husband (25M) and I decided to name her Whitney. My husband and I have been married for 2 years, and dating for 3, so I do know a lot about him. I knew that his ex-girlfriends name is Whitney, and I knew that she was very emotionally abusive of him. They dated for 4 years, I never met Whitney, but everybody tells me that she destroyed his self confidence and whatnot. However when he talked about her I fell in love with the name Whitney.

Before our daughter was born, we agreed on the names Hazel and Leona. My husband loved both of the names equally, and told me to name our daughter. I guess my mind stopped working because I named her Whitney while my husband was getting me something from the car that I purchased for our family. When he found out I named her Whitney, he got very sad. Not really angry, but his face went from excited, to extremely caught off guard and sad. He asked me why I didn't choose one of the two we decided on. He said he didn't really want to name her Whitney, but when I told him how much I loved it, he just kind of dropped it until his brother and sister flew up to visit a week after she was born. We don't talk to them often, because I don't like them, and don't want them coming over to my house. However, we decided that it wouldn't be horrible for them to come meet their niece.

My brother in law questioned me, and asked my husband if he forgot to tell me about his ex girlfriend. When he said no, I was verbally attacked and called selfish and creepy. My sister-in-law talked to my brother in private, and told me what I did was wrong. I found this extremely rude, and it is not their place to question me on what I name MY child. My husband doesn't call her Whitney, he calls her by her middle name, and seems fine doing so, so I don't see the problem. I refuse to change her name because I love the name Whitney, but I fail to see why my in-laws don't approve. It's just a name, and our daughter will change his associations with the name. All of my in-laws have started calling her by her middle name. AITA for naming my daughter?",Asshole
WIBTA for asking my ex not to tell my kid I ever existed?,"Basically my 4 year girlfriend announced she was pregnant last week, she seemed kinda enthusiastic and happy about it, me on the other hand I was crushed ,destroyed and was dying on the inside, she said she had forgotten her pills, and she was probably lying about it but it didn’t matter at that point. 


I told her about my real feelings regarding what happened, she started crying and did so for hours until she calmed down, I told her she should abort, she said she wasn’t going to.


And I made it clear I wouldn’t be in the kid’s life emotionally at all, but I would support him/her financially.


Now I honestly don’t want anything to do with the kid now or ever, so I was thinking of convincing my ex to never disclose that I’m paying anything and find some excuse as where she gets the child support from, because I really never wanted children, and the idea that someone 18 year or something from now will knock on my door saying he is my child is freaking me , and I will be getting vasectomy very soon.


Still I feel really guilty for doing this, I would appreciate other perspectives",Asshole
AITA for not being gay?,"Just a little information. To clarify, I’m a straight male who, at the time, had bright blue dyed hair. Earlier this year I went to one of my high school’s varsity football games with my girlfriend. It was me, my gf, one of her friends Mike (who came out as bisexual), and a mutual friend Sara who isn’t really part of the story (not real names).
We were all having a good time just talking in our little group when a boy and a girl walked up to us. The girl was infront of the boy because I guess he wasn’t confident but she said that he liked me and wanted to ask me out. I declined stating “I’m not gay”. The girl looked pleased with my answer and walked away but the boy stayed. He got mad at me and said that I should’ve at least considered him and that I “looked gay” so I should give it some thought. I got mad at this and cursed him out a little until we went away. 
After they had left I made a joke along the lines of “i didn’t know i looked THAT good”. Mike scoffed at this asking me what was wrong with being gay and called me a homophobe and other names. I asked him what was wrong with what I did and he told me that I “acted like being gay was a bad thing”. I told him that I was right to be mad that he misread what I was and pushed on when I corrected him. My gf sided with Mike but understood why I was mad while Sara sided with me. I asked Mike how he would feel if a girl walked up to him asking him out and saying “you wouldn’t know what it is like to be with a girl if you never have been”, after you corrected her. He told me that it wasn’t a fair comparison and that I was asking for it by having dyed hair. He then stormed off and still doesn’t talk to me. Me, my gf, and Sara stayed and had a good time without mentioning what had happened again.
Well recently I was texting my gf and it came up again and she said that she thought I was an asshole in the situation. I admit I could’ve handled it better but I think that i was right to be mad that he pushed on after i corrected him. I don’t think that there is anything wrong with being gay or bisexual but what the guy said wasn’t ok and whether he was mad that I rejected him or not, he shouldn’t have suggested that I am or should be gay, just like I shouldn’t suggest that someone else is or should be straight. So reddit, AITA?

UPDATE: so as it turns out when i turned my back the guy walked away crying which is why they thought i was such an asshole. This is also why Mike got up and left. I still think that i’m NTA but I do feel a little bad. AI(still)TA",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting girls to bite off the other end of my Pocky sticks?,"20 year old Korean-American dude here. I’m 6’1”, a little awkward, but would say I’m above average looking. Usually I’m pretty reserved, but yesterday afternoon I felt a little flirtatious. I had a box of Pocky sticks in my backpack so I decided to flirt with some girls on campus by putting the handle end of a Pocky stick in my mouth and going up to girls to let them keep biting the chocolate part off until they become uncomfortable with how close our lips eventually get. This is an alternate version of a popular Korean game. I tried this with three girls. They all seemed nervous to varying degrees when I approached them with a Pocky stick in my mouth, but they all giggled and eventually took at least a bite. I finished the Pocky sticks after they felt uncomfortable about going any further and struck great conversations with them. The second and third girls gave me their numbers. 


After my third interaction, a girl came up to me and told me that she followed me around and said I’m harassing these girls and needed to stop or she’ll report me to campus police. I told her that I’m not making them bite the Pocky sticks against their will even though I might have appeared a little insistent, but rather they do it because they’re not uptight prudes like her. She told me that they all seemed incredibly uncomfortable with the situation I’m subjecting them to. Again, I said that they have their own free will and it’s college so she needs to loosen up a little. She told me that if she sees me doing this with another girl again, she will record it and show it to the police. I told her to stop stalking me and walked away. She ruined the flirtatious vibe I had and so I stopped playing the Pocky game. I discussed this with some friends and I got split judgments.",Asshole
WIBTA for dressing trashy on Halloween?,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

Background: I've always been an environmentalist. In the past couple of years, I've taken it up a notch because my eco-anxiety has gone through the roof. I am a Zero Waster and do my absolute best to not use plastic or make excess waste (I compost, etc.) I've been dating my awesome boyfriend for a little less than a year. He is very supportive of my values and has even come to Extinction Rebellion protests with me. He's learning how to be zero waste through me.

The Conundrum: He's hosting a Halloween costume party at a place that has a bar. Halloween is his absolute favorite time of year. I asked him if he would be mad if I showed up in costume as the Pacific Garbage Vortex, with plastic glued to me, and if anyone wanted to talk about the climate crisis or plastic recycling problem (only 9% of recyclable plastic is actually recycled), I would love to talk to them about it. He did not like the idea - he thought it was a total downer - and didn't think that people who want to get drunk on Halloween would be interested in talking about the climate apocalypse (""They're there to have fun!""). He didn't tell me I couldn't wear it, but I was pretty frustrated that he wasn't being supportive. We talked in circles for an hour about when it's appropriate to protest, whether it was inappropriate for me to be wearing it...I was kinda confused because he supports XR, which has the philosophy of ""Sorry, this is totally inconvenient, but so is mass starvation and famine."" I see this as kinda the same, although I'm not going to go around and start talking about waste. I'm just going to respond if people are curious and ask me about it. He thinks they're definitely going to be curious.

WIBTA if I wore plastic and talked about plastic (if asked) at my boyfriend's Halloween party?

I'll accept whatever judgment I get and am fully prepared to apologize to him if I'm wrong.

EDIT: Just wanted to emphasize that I would only discuss plastic/climate crisis if asked. My goal was not to be preachy, though I see how it comes across that way.",Asshole
AITA for just leaving my gf's place when she's on her period?,"Title sounds bad but there's a lot more to the story. Me and my gf are both 21 in uni. I live at home so she doesn't really come here as my mother is kinda conservative and is against her sleeping over. I mostly go to her place and we have sex play video games chill, smoke weed just hang and have fun. My gf has this habit of inviting me over and then telling me that she's on her period whenever we try to have sex (I'm okay having sex on one's period but she isnt' finds it gross)

I asked her numerous times to tell me before I come over just so my expectations are accurate. She doesn't or she'll tell me that she isn't yet and then when I arrive inform me that she just got it (which I think is a lie tbh but what do I know about periods really)

Anyway I told my older brother this and he said that she only does it cause I let her get away with it, I asked what he wanted me to do about it since I'm already there and our relationship isn't just sex. he suggested that I leave a few times and she'll eventually figure it's best to just be honest with me.

I recently took his advice much to the chagrin of my gf and she ended up posting about it on social media, I'm now being lambasted by girls everywhere calling me a misogynistic pig and other less happy language. The post has gone semi viral in my town and I'm wondering amitheasshole?

Well thanx guys it looks like I'm the AH since I'm supposedly acting entitled to sex. Ignoring the fact that she's entitled to my attention (as anyone could figure out from my post) this barrage has made me realise that this relationship isn't going anywhere. See my gf is a lot like the users of AITA, too wrapped up in gender stuff to ever see where I'm coming from. So I've decided to dump her since convincing you guys of anything is like pulling teeth and she's just gonna be the same. So well done, you've freed a girl from another patriarchal dickhead congrats.

AITA no I won't interact with your spawn,"To paint a picture of my life, I'm physically disabled. My back is forever messed up and my ankle has gone them three surgeries, may be getting it fused soon. I walk with a cane, compression stockings and braces. Walking more than 20 minutes is agony. 

My SO and her sister were in NYC, we went to the Nintendo store- I got a litten plush and from walking I'm exhausted. So we find a Starbucks. Good ol Starbucks packed AF. But I manage to see a table that's free, and in my agony I see a blessed chair. Aw lord it looked comfortable. My SO tells me to go claim that table and I hobble my ass over to it, now mind you the table is fairly close to another table but the women and their spawn aren't at it or waiting for anyone so I take the seat and you can hear my joints popping. 

I felt like a had a bone saw in my ankle, so to ignore the pain I took out my phone,  cuddled my plush and read. All is well right?

Nope. The child who might be 5 and the other 7 decide to keep saying hello to me, mind you im not looking up from my phone and my anxiety is over the moon. So I ignore them and I can see them shaking a doll at me to play, again nope. The mother tells them to 'leave her alone she doesn't want to say hello."" in the snottiest voice only a supreme Karen can do. 

The real fun was when they saw my plush and one wailed that they wanted it. The mother again, deciding she had enough says ""no you can't have the cute toy, and how rude is it to not say hello. Atleast order a drink."" She snapped. 

My SO was walking over with my tea and the women left with their spawn as if I told them to fuck off. 

Was I the asshole? Should I have just held back my tears and force myself to be nice? My anxiety is making me second guess myself.

Edit: When I opened my mouth to say thank you to my SO I started sobbing from the pain, to talk to the kids I probably would have done the same and probably scared them.

You could see I was 5seconds away from sobbing.

AITA for pointing out some dark hairs on my girlfriends chin?,"My gf is the kind of girl who takes pride in her physical appearance. It’s actually something that attracted me to her because I like a girl who takes care of herself. 

The other day I noticed she had a couple of dark hairs on her chin and I (helpfully - I thought) pointed them out to her in case she hadn’t seen them, I joked to her that she’s letting herself go in lockdown. 

I’m a really honest guy so maybe I’ll mention a blackhead or something if I noticed it but I don’t say it in a mean way, I just say it so she can deal with it PRIVATELY. She got really upset and looked like she was going to cry and told me I was cruel, but I really was just being helpful. If I was a girl I’d be really appreciative if someone pointed out something that I hadn’t realised, especially if it was unsightly. Don’t get me wrong, she’s usually really good at hair removal and wears makeup every day and keeps everything in check and I am really thankful for that and tell her often, to encourage her to keep doing it.  

She says I’ve upset her because I talk about her appearance a lot, but I don’t think I do. I make recommendations for how she can wear her hair sometimes (it looks much better down) or sometimes what shoes she should wear with an outfit because I want her to look nice and I to want take interest in her fashion and stuff because she’s really insecure. I try really hard to make suggestions and also be on the same wavelength as her because admittedly I’m a lot more intellectually minded than she is. She is still being really funny with me and pulling alway from me when I try to touch and initiate her body. I feel like this has gone too far.

AITA for limiting my daughter's clothing choices?,"Okay. To start off I will give some background information. I (43 M) have an extreme aversion to bellybuttons, and am repulsed and disgusted when I see them. I have politely requested that members of my family do not where clothing that reveals their bellybuttons as it makes me physically uncomfortable due to childhood trauma that I would not like to get into. My daughter (16 F) however disregards this request and wears crop tops because it's ""the rage"" as she puts it. I have asked her multiple times to stop, and explained to her how it makes me feel, but she just disrespectfully rolls her eyes at me and laughs blowing the issue off. The issue has become more and more heated, and today I extensively searched through her closet and donated all the crop tops I could find. My daughter cried in her room when I broke the news to her, as she had spent considerable sums on the clothing, and my wife thought I had crossed some major lines.

AITA because I give my ex flowers and gifts...,"31m here ex is 20f

she broke up with me 5 months ago. i was heartbroken. I thought we were going to get married.

Her: Listen, please stop giving me things.

Me: oh :( I just thought we could still be friends. we had a lot of good laughs

Her: Friends are not flowers and sweets. We can be friends when you decide to let go and accept these gifts aren't for me, but for you and the attempt to try to get me back.

I just meant it as friendly gifts to brighten her day.

EDIT:: I want to add in since this is getting out of hand I met her when she was 18 and dated her when she was 19 for 11 months. it's cliche but she was more mature than most girls her age. she had been through a lot physically and mentally you could see an obvious difference in her. she broke up with me to take care of her mental health.

AITA for telling my skinny friend to stop calling herself curvy?,"I have a friend in my main circle that has recently started describing herself as curvy. She’s not though. She put on a few pounds recently to become barely above underweight with chicken hips still and thinks she has curves because she just got fake knockers. She keeps saying things like “it feels great to be curvy”, “guys have started noticing my curves”, etc. She hasn’t referred to us as curvy nor have we categorized our own figures aloud. 


No one has said anything to her about it for over a month, but we do talk about it when she’s not around. Some of us think she’s saying that to make us actual curvy girls feel fat. I’m actually curvy unlike her. I have a natural hourglass figure. 


Today, that friend said to me and another actual curvy friend “being curvy is great but us curvy girls got to always watch what we eat or we’d become straight up fat in no time”. I told her “yo chicken hips, you’re not even close to curvy like [name of that curvy friend] and I”. She said “calm down [my name], there’s different degrees of curvy”. I said “stop calling yourself curvy since it’s making us actual curvy girls feel fat”. She said “alright chill girl”. Hopefully she doesn’t call herself curvy again.",Asshole
AITA: So I have a baby German Shepard who chewed up my brothers shoes while I was away. He wants me to pay for them. I don’t think that responsibly is mine.,"So I have a dog who’s a little over one year old and he is very well behaved. Last week my brother decided to come visit my place for the weekend. While I was at work the dog Chewed up my brothers shoes ($100+) of which were the first shoes he’s ever chewed up since he was about 2 months old.. he isn’t known for destroying anything while I go to work and overall acts like an independent young adult. 

So I know that my dog treats other people besides myself as “friends” (over-playful and somewhat almost non responsive to others commands) while with me I am his alpha. Never needing to tell him not to bite or not to jump on me, heeling etc. 

So my question is.. Do I need to cough up funds to replace his belongings? Or is the fact that it happen at my house with him staying with me make it his fault?

AITA for telling my SIL that fed is not best.,"

I’m an avid breastfeeder. I’m been breastfeeding my son for 6 months. My goal is 2 years. We had a little trouble In the beginning but we overcame the issues. I tried so hard because I firmly believe that Breast is best. That doesn’t mean I think formula feeding moms are less I just believe breastmilk is better for baby because it’s specifically made for baby.

I’ve never really had any issues with anyone making rude remarks about me breastfeeding and my in-laws have all been very supportive except for my SIL T. She’s never said anything but she will roll her eyes or walk away while I’m feeding. T has a daughter a month younger than my son and she formula feeds. She said she wasn’t able to breastfeed because she didn’t make enough but she only tried for about week and then started formula feeding. I don’t think she gave it enough time but I have never said that to her because I know it can be a touchy subject.

The other day we were at my in-laws house. My MIL was feeding T’s daughter a bottle whole I was feeding my son the boob. T made a remark that she thought her mother would really like to be able to feed my son but since I didn’t pump she wouldn’t have that opportunity. She was making remarks about how formula gave other people a chance to bond with the baby. I said there were plenty of other opportunities for my MIL and other people to bond with baby that doesn’t involve feeding and right now I’m providing him with what he needs. 

I don’t think she liked that answer because she said “well fed is best.” I said to her that I have no problem with formula but fed is not best. Breast is. At this point she just lost it and told me how I was being inconsiderate of her feelings because she couldn’t breastfeed so that means she isn’t providing her baby with what’s best so she must be a terrible mother. 
I never said anything of that nature. I was just stating that breastmilk is better. Science even says so. 

Am I being an asshole? My MIL thinks I need to apologize. My husband thinks my SIL is just being dramatic.",Asshole
AITA for not allowing my 16 year old son to wear makeup?,"About a month ago, my son came to my wife and I about wanting to experiment with makeup.  He told us he was interested in makeup in an artistic sense, but I feel like that is an just an excuse.  I told him that he wasn't to wear makeup under my roof.  In my household, he is to follow my rules.  

My son seemed offended by what I said and we didn't talk much for a few days.  About a week after our conversation, I found makeup hidden in his room and threw it away.  When I confronted him about it, he was very upset and accused me of being sexsist (his younger sister wears very minimal makeup).  Ever since, we have been very distant and I am at a loss about what to do.   

I love my son, and just want the best for him.  He's always been somewhat feminine, and though I try to encourage him to behave in a way more acceptable for men, he doesn't seem to catch on.  If he wants to pursue makeup when he's no longer financially dependent on my wife and I, I suppose I can't stop him, but while he's living with us and being supported by my income, I expect him to follow my rules.  Is that too much to ask?

Edit: Many of you have asked about why I won't let my son wear makeup.  We live in a relatively conservative community, and I'm simply worried about him causing conflict by wearing makeup out in public and having trouble finding a job in the future due to being ostracized.",Asshole

AITA For making my girlfriend stay in a hotel instead of my apartment?,"My girlfriend and I are currently long distance and have been with each other for around 5 months. We met this summer on vacation and had feelings so intense we decided to keep it going. We are both college students.

Anyways, she decided that last weekend she was going to come visit me for 3 days. I live in an apartment with my brother and my parents DO NOT know we are dating nor does my brother. I told her she could stay at my apartment with me but then realized my brother might see her and tell my parents so I notified her weeks in advance she could not stay with me. She said fine and that she would stay at a hotel.

She arrives and things go great, but then at the end of the day I walk her back to her hotel room and she seems confused. She asks me why I'm not going to stay with her and I told her that my brother and parents would get suspicious if I don't spend the night at my apartment. She didn't seem super upset only disappointed which I understood, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal.

On the last day of the trip I take her to the airport and ask her when she thinks she's gonna visit me next. She gave me a dirty look and said ""If I'm going to be paying a bunch of money on a flight and a hotel room just to sleep alone, then you can come visit me next time."" I thought this was unfair of her and reminded her that 1. She didn't have to come visit me and that 2. She never asked me to pay for any of these things. I was super happy to see her, but if she didn't feel like she could afford it or she would have been upset with these arrangements, then she shouldn't have come or told me sooner.

Since then, she's been a lot more distant towards me and I can't help but feel like I screwed up a little bit. I think I could have handled that conversation better, but she really put me on the spot and I wasn't about to let myself be called a jerk. AITA?

Edit: For those asking we are both 20 and juniors in college. My parents can't know about her because my mother is a bit controlling and would want to meet her and I feel as though the relationship is way too new for that.

AITA for telling my cousin how many calories she ate?,"In recent months I (F16) have been on a weight loss journey, and have grown accustomed to keeping track of what I eat and choosing healthy alternatives to junk food. Today I witnessed my 11-year-old cousin (who weighs about the same weight as me \[160lbs\]) eat 3 bags of mini muffins, and 2 quesadillas within an hour. Because I've grown accustomed to keeping track of the calories I ate, started adding up the amount of food she ate in my head and realized it was over 1000 calories. So I straight-up told her how many calories she just ate and that it's not healthy.  
I think that I'm the asshole because talking about people's weigh and stuff like that isn't a nice thing to do, but my cousin is overweight at such a young age. I thought that maybe if she could put a number to the amount of food she just ate she would realize that she's eating too much.",Asshole
AITA for not providing my address to my friends in a bet?,"I am in a fantasy football league where the loser must suffer some kind of punishment. Last year it was decided that the loser would have to wear the jersey of the winner's choice every Sunday for the next season. Welp I lost and next season is around the corner and they are finally getting me the jersey.

So they asked for my address. I told them no, they should have it. I'm not gonna do them any favors, they're my friends who I see at least once a month or two, though we're split up across a few cities now. I don't think I'm obligated to help. Not saying I'll run away from them or pretend I didn't get it, but I think it's fair for me to theoretically say ""get me the jersey to my hand, house, or mailbox. But I'm not going to help you do it.""

They're pissed. Threatening to throw me out of the league and all this because they don't think I'm honoring the bet. I keep telling them to just get me the jersey.

AITA?

For a little additional context, the last time we did this and someone lost the bet, they had their Xbox Gamertag changed by the winner. Everyone is saying, hey when Brian (name changed) lost the bet he cooperated. But we don't have access to his account. The situation is different because there is nothing we can do to get him to do change it if he doesn't do it himself. And we still sent him the $10 fee to change his gamertag. I think my response is similar. Get me the jersey and I'll wear it, logistics are on them.

EDIT: a couple points from the comments that keep coming up.

1. It's not a privacy issue, just my own feelings that the onus is on them to get me the jersey. Many of them have visited and received mail from me or my gf. They should have my address. This is just a point of not doing their job for them to arrange my punishment
2. Agreed in advance (because of the gamertag situation) that the rest of the league pays, loser doesn't have to do that
3. The jersey is a 4XL Steelers (I'm an Eagles fan that wears a L) jersey that says ""Ronthlisbrngur""",Asshole
AITA for Telling My Nieces Their Grandparents are Incestuous?,"My Mother divorced my Father and almost immediately started dating (and eventually married) his brother. She had good reason to leave my Father—he was an abusive bastard, but it turns out so is my Uncle. I remember her saying to me once when I was young “I just married the wrong brother the first time!” It ripped the entire family apart. Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins took sides and stopped speaking to each other. My Cousins became my step-siblings, my Uncle became my Stepfather. It had to be kept a secret at school so that my siblings and I didn’t become the butt of jokes. There were so many close calls where I alternatively referred to him as my Uncle and my Stepfather in the same conversation and was almost caught. 

My Dad lost his mind over the whole thing and is convinced she was cheating with my Uncle while they were married. I didn’t believe it when I was a kid but now I’m not so sure. They are definitely both liars and capable of cheating. 

No one in the family ever really talks about it. Now my siblings and I are grown and have kids of our own. I make it clear whenever it comes up that he is my Uncle and his children are my Cousins. Recently the topic came up in front of my Nieces and I referred to the situation as incest without even thinking about it. My siblings are upset and calling me an asshole. They told my mother and she’s upset with me. It may not be what people generally think of when they say incest, but it fits the definition of incest by affinity. At one point my Mother was impregnated by my Uncle but lost the fetus. If it had survived it would have been related to me by blood on both sides of the family. To me that’s clearly incest. 

So AITA for continuing to call out the situation for what is is and not sugarcoat it for the teenagers of the family?

AITA for choosing our dog over a child?,"So basically, my wife has always wanted children. I’m fine with our sweet fur baby, but we’ve also tried for a baby sometimes and I’d be fine if she got pregnant with my child. 

Recently, my wife’s relative was diagnosed with stage IV cancer and there have been talks about what to do with her three-year-old if she dies (the dad is not in the picture). My wife suggested that we take the child in, since she is close to that relative and enjoys spending time with them. 

The problem is that the child has a dog allergy. Every time the brat comes over he wants to play with our pup, and inevitably he ends up wheezing with dripping eyes and needing to be strapped to a weird breathing machine. I know kids are fucking stupid, but he’s literally endangering his life every time he comes over. It’s disgusting and infuriating. 

I brought this up with my wife and she said that we’d just need to keep our dog outside and make sure that the kid stays away from him. I told her that that was ridiculous. Taking a dog’s home away because of some kid is just insane. She claimed I was putting a dog’s happiness above a child’s, but the way I see it, it would be traumatic for both parties to have the kid stay with us, but if the kid goes to literally any other home, the trauma would be limited to the kid. 

My wife made me feel heartless, but I’m just trying to think logically. The kid is going to have a rough time no matter what, but that doesn’t mean I have to completely restructure my family. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for prohibiting my daughter from wearing an oversized t-shirt over extremely short shorts in public?,"My daughter has always dressed modestly before. She came back home after a semester of college and has been wearing some questionable outfits. Last week, she wore a zip up jacket with nothing underneath to meet up with her friends. I told her that was inappropriate to go out in public in and to wear something under that. She said I was making a big deal out of nothing and went out like that. My husband said he didn’t think her outfit was inappropriate. 


Yesterday, my daughter was planning to meet up with her friends wearing an oversized t-shirt over extremely short shorts. The t-shirt covers her entire shorts when she’s standing up and you can almost see her entire thigh. I told her that she couldn’t leave the house dressing like that. She told me again that I’m making a big deal out of nothing and many of her friends dress like this too and it’s really in right now. I put my foot down this time and told her that I wouldn’t stand to have her turn into a floozy before my eyes and she needs to change into a more appropriate outfit if she wanted to leave the house. She argued with me for a while and even called me an old hag, but ultimately changed into skinny jeans and left. 


She told my husband about this last night. He said that he sees women dressing like that all the time and doesn’t see why I’m making such a big deal about this, especially since our daughter is an adult now. I said that just because other girls her age dress like floozies doesn’t mean she has to or should. My husband kept telling me to just let her dress how she likes since it’s really not a big deal, doesn’t make her look like a floozy, and it’s better for our mother-daughter relationship if I give her full autonomy. I agreed to disagree on the floozy point, however I reluctantly agreed to let my daughter wear whatever she wanted in public because I didn’t want her to hate me anymore. 


My husband told me later to apologize to her too, but I made it clear to him that I didn’t think I did anything wrong. In fact, I told him that my daughter is the one that should be apologizing for being flippant when I expressed my disapproval of her outfits. My husband said I was very stubborn and just told me to let her dress however she likes. My daughter is still purposely being very aloof around me.",Asshole
AITA for revealing that someone wrote erotica?,"I was recently searching my coworkers name in the internet and sorta half-stalked them. That was until I found an erotica sex story online. I read it. It was definitely about our office. There were far too many coincidences for it to not be. I won’t go into detail, but it involves mind control, body swaps, etc. Pretty well written.
 
I saw the username and instantly recognized who it was. It was her nickname and the year that she was born in. Again, far too many coincidences.
 
So, I just got the link and posted it into our private group chat. Then, everyone started to make fun of her. Then, she just called me an asshole and just left the video call.

AITA for telling my husband someone else can do his job?,"my husband was recently hired on for a job doing, let’s say, accounts receivable for a small company.

only, during his first week, leadership told him he needed to do (let’s say) sales for the first couple of months in order to “earn his keep”.  this was not communicated to him before he took the job.  he has zero sales experience but tried his best while simultaneously looking for a new job because he was uncomfortable with the overall weirdness of the situation.  he also complained of the working environment generally including a lot of yelling by leadership when they were around, but they were generally absent.

he thinks he did well for a beginner in sales, but that he did have questions as this was new to him and no training period was provided.  he came home every day, stressed and depressed.  it really took a toll on him.  three weeks in, he was fired for not cc’ing a leadership member on an e-mail to another member of leadership.  i’ve read the emails and know this to be true.  i’ve also seen communications and can confirm leadership was genuinely unreasonable.

he told me he was almost glad to be fired because the work was so stressful and he doesn’t think anyone could’ve walked into the situation as they laid it out and been successful.  i told him that, actually, statistically speaking, someone would’ve been able to be successful in that job.  he told me that when i said that, it felt like i was calling him a failure.  i told him that i wasn’t saying he was a failure, but that i like to be honest with people and not comfort them with lies.  the truth is, someone out there could’ve done this job.

AITA for coming out at a homophobic family reunion?,"This is a very special pride month present for everyone.
So for a little context I am a non-binary bisexual and I’m very happy with my partner(we just got engaged)but I never told my parents because they are super homophobic and would even freak out if they were being told a opposite opinion. So I kept the secret and just told everyone I was a straight female. But all that changed when I met my partner and we really got along great. So soon my parents text me that a family reunion is happening in Mobile,Alabama (sry for the other people living here) so I get a little nervous because I never introduced my parents to my partner. So when we get there I hold their hand and walked into my granny’s old house. The convo goes as follows...
Mom:oh sweetie, is that a boyfriend I see?
Partner:umm actually I’m their partner...
Dad:WHAT?! “THEY??”
Partner:yeah they are non-binary 
Mom and dad then proceeded to scream at me then my aunts and uncles ask what’s going on.
Mom:my daughter has turned into a demon and brought her hell spawn with her
Then I ran out of the door bursting into tears while my partner proceeds to give a mouthful saying that they were lucky to have me and they should apologize to me.
Since then I’ve been getting texts saying I’m going to burn in hell for being gay. So my question is: am I a asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my family I deserve at least some praise for saving someone’s life?,"My sister and I are twins (31.) She recently got pregnant after what she describes as a “difficult journey.” We both have endometriosis, and I never wanted kids, but she is obsessed with being a mom, so for her it’s a much bigger deal (neither of us has severe pain, but her uterus is basically glued to her bowels making pregnancy very difficult.) My sister underwent 2 surgeries not including the IVF procedures to get pregnant. 

Now I’m very against reproduction in general but I don’t usually talk about it. I think what my sister did was insanely selfish but I’m not a jerk so of course I said congratulations. But in the back of my mind I’m thinking sooo much wasted resources on this child plus my sister has a history of depression so now she’s passed on bad genes to a child who may also get depression in time.

But I didn’t say that. Around this time I rescued a dog from a shelter that would have put her down THAT DAY if I hadn’t swept in. She has three legs and is 9 years old. 

I understand to most people a baby is a bigger deal than a dog. I disagree but I get that’s a minority opinion. My issue is that the entire family has patted my sister and her partner on the back for “perservering” when them conceiving a child has absolutely nothing to do with the greater good. Meanwhile I actually save a life that already existed and...nothing. Nobody has congratulated me on the dog. My mom said the dog was cute when I sent photos, that’s it. Maybe it’s because this is my 4th dog, but I rescued all of them. I’m not just adding to climate change by bringing more lives into the world.

To me it just feels like praising a war criminal for being “strong” but ignoring someone like Oscar Schindler who is actually saving lives. Like it’s fine if they don’t want to agree with my stance but really they’re not going to even say congrats?

I sent an email to our parents, our brother, and other relatives expressing my disappointment and the clear “humans first” and “reproduction first” attitude they were taking. I pointed out I was happy for my sister but let’s be real, she could have adopted a teenager from foster care or DO WHAT I DO and save animals if she wanted to be a parent.  Maybe that went too far. But anyway, now my family is super pissed. I admit I may have gotten too emotional about it but my main point isn’t crazy; right?",Asshole
AITA because I told my ex that his niece was planning to get a secret tattoo on her 18th Bday?,"So, I have an open relationship with my kids, meaning they tell me most of the hot gossip with friends, fam, etc. The other night, my youngest tells me that her cousin - turning 18 next month - is planning on getting a tattoo. She has to hide it from her parents. She was trying to figure out a place to put it on her body where they wouldn’t see. They are very against it and she’s also just a senior in high school. 
I debated about it and decided to tell my ex so he could alert his sister as long as I wasn’t mentioned as a source. There could be a billion other sources, she’s not the best at keeping secrets this kid. But my friends think it was a dick move because my daughter told me and I betrayed her trust. IMO, she wasn’t telling me like ‘keep this secret’ it was more like ‘can you believe this shit?’

AITA?

Edit: okay so I’m TA. I’m guessing there are not many parents here. FTR, I don’t care if an 18 year old gets a tattoo at all. Your body. But, her parents care and they forbade her. As a parent...your house, your rules. And there are a ton of sketchy tattoo places where she lives. Actively knowing that she’s planning an ass or underboob tat? Ugh.

AITA for reccommending a classmate wear bras in class.,"I (18M) have started an artistic uni course with lots of students from around the world, including many British (The course is in London), Americans, Bermudans (I think that's how I write that?) and a fair few Europeans. My classmate (18F) is from Germany and I am from the UK. In my experience most women wear bra's, especially in more formal situations such as at lessons at uni. I think in a lot of Europe it is less common? I happened to be in a room alone with her on the third day of the course and noticed she wasn't wearing a bra and was wearing a thin white t-shirt. I asked her if I could give her some advice and when she said yes I said I would recommend wearing bras at uni, especially when wearing white tops. I said how in the UK it was more normal for women to wear bras than to not and that she may get strange looks if she does not. We both know that some days we will be working up to 14 hours per day on stages under hot lights doing physical work. (Worth noting perhaps that we are not doing dance.) She said she would continue to wear what she wants and refernced women burning their bras. I agreed that I didn't think anyone could stop her and that she should wear what she feels comfortable in (I wear very informal clothes every day so I understand what it's like having ppl telling you what to wear.) Just before we left she asked if I thought the course tutors might mention it and I said I thought they probably would at some point.  which certainly seemed to surprise her. She kind of off hand refernced it a couple times later when we were in common rooms but we never discussed it in any detail after that and haven't talked since. AITA?

TL;DR- young women from Germany moved to UK and doesn't want to wear bras. I suggested that she should especially when working long days.

EDIT: P.S. People from the UK, are my experiences/expectations unrealistic or unrepresentative? Genuinly interested to find out.

EDIT2: To save me writing the same comment multiple times to ppl who I suspect skipped over some of the detail hidden in the middle of my post: 

Fuck those people who judge people based on what they wear. My intenions were to make this women aware that people may judge her behind her back, even if that made her feel self-councious. I would feel like an asshole if I felt that that might be happenening and I didn't tell her straight up.

EDIT3: Since I'm still getting comments on this I thought I'd update it to say I had a chat with 18F on Monday eve and they were totally fine with it and understood I had just meant to be nice. I still gave an apology in case I had been rude and we had a laugh about it and moved on, water under the bridge. Thanks for all the comments that were giving genuine reactions though, I clearly hurt a lot of you more than I hurt 18F.",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister she should dress more conservatively?,"I'm also a woman, and my sister is 24 no college education and works as an admin assistant in a small business.

I don't hang out with her much but tonight be and 3 of her friends went out to celebrate her birthday.

She wore a short skirt, which was reasonable but also a white cropped tube top that was very tight and sort of see through. Not so see through that you could see her areolas but see through enough that get nipples were visible 90% of the time.

All night at the bar I noticed men staring, making comments to their friends.

She's got big boobs so she really didn't need to display them THAT much. But she did.

Most of the night and she complains how men only want sex and no guy really seems genuine or not sleezy etc.

So maybe a fews drinks in, I tell her, maybe you'd meet better men of you didn't dress like this (pointing to get boobs). She was shocked and told me nothing was wrong
 with her top and that it was only in very bright light hey nipples would show. I didn't mean that the top was sheer, but anytime her nipples were hard, everyone would see.

She got upset and said I'm rude and slut shaming and that she didn't want a guy who'd judge her like that.

It was a bit a drunk argument so any rational points could have been misinterpreted, but I told her that's not how it is in the real world.

AITA I hunt animals for animal-cruelty reasons,"Hey there,

so first: this is not about one event in particular but rather about my life-style choice that I got a lot of shits for.

I'm a 25 year old woman and I am a full-time hunter since 2017. It's not a hobby, I don't do it for fun but it's my job to kill animals for their meat.

But since 2013 I'm also a vegetarian. I don't eat meat myself and I try to use as few animal product as possible. I don't drink a lot of milk, I don't eat a lot of cheese etc.

For some that might sound strange, but let me explain: I don't expect anybody to change their eating-habits today and I don't want people to completely stop eating meat. That just won't happen and it's okay. I became a vegetarian for animal-cruelty reasons but quickly saw that this won't make a big difference. There are still a lot of people who get their meat from horrible sources. That's why I wanted to help giving them an alternative. If I say ""Stop eating meat"", they won't listen and I would just enforce my beliefs on them, but if I say ""Hey, stop eating meat from bad sources. Come to me and you will get fresh meat that I took directly out of the nature from an animal who roamed through the wood completely free and that had a nice life."", they will probably change something. Vegan alternatives aren't something for everyone but meat alternatives are a nice thing for them. 

Usually people find it strange when I tell them about about my job, but they quickly understand what I mean and by now a lot of people buy their meat from me which makes me super happy. Also some people started to only buy meat from me or other hunters. That's awesome! They will still have their meat but at the same time, they don't give their money to big mass-producers.

But every time, and I really mean every time, I talk about this with a vegetarian/vegan they really hate me for it! They don't understand what I'm doing and why I am doing this. They only hear ""I kill animals and without me, less animals would get killed!"". And last weekend, I was nearly thrown out a house where I was invited for dinner (it was a friend of my boyfriend and she didn't knew, what I was doing and she is a vegan). And I really started to think about it lately. Is my opinion bad? I am fully aware that it sounds weird but am I an asshole for killing animals in order to help animals?",Asshole
AITA for complaining about the way my wife does the dishes because she complains about the meals I cook?,"For the past year, the arrangement in our house is this: I (27M) cook dinner for both of us, and my wife (25F) does the dishes after (and puts them away). Before, we used to cook dinner and do the dishes together, but she switched jobs and works longer hours, so she isn't home in time to cook. 

She also used to be in charge of grocery shopping, but as her work got busier in the past few weeks, I have started doing that instead.

Lately she's been getting upset with me over the meals I've been cooking because I don't want to use lactose-free or gluten-free products (she used to only buy these as she did the shopping), as I think they taste worse than normal products. She is lactose intolerant and mildly irritated by gluten, but has a pill she can take to counter that. I told her that if I was buying groceries and cooking meals, I would use whatever products I wanted. However, she continued to complain. 

Last night she complained again because I made mac 'n cheese, so I waited until she started doing dishes and told her she was doing it wrong, and that I wouldn't cook in any dishes that weren't washed properly. She got super irritated with me and has been ignoring me since.

AITA for kicking out my MIL after she relentlessly criticized my spending habits?,"My husband (44M) and I (31F) are working from home and we decided we needed some help keeping the kids (6M, 3F, 3M) in line and making sure they’re doing their schoolwork so we invited his mom (66F) to stay with us. It actually worked out because my husband’s father is a doctor and has continued to go to work but she has some health conditions so it is good to minimize her risk of getting exposed to the virus. I don’t actually have a regular 9-5 job, I have a side business, so I have some free time on my hands. So sometimes I am on my laptop online shopping and my MIL will get glimpses of what I’m doing. My husband’s salary is quite high (high six figures) and I can afford to buy what I want. Here are some things I have purchased that my MIL has had something to say about:

* Crème de la Mer Moisturizer ($400)
* Lululemon pants ($90 each)
* Shoes ($130)
* Big haul at Sephora (makeup & skincare store) ($485)
* Jura coffee machine ($3000) (This wasn't just for me, my husband and MIL both love coffee and have been itching for some good coffee and my husband needs his morning cup of joe)

Yes, she saw me buy all those things, she must just be monitoring what I do online 🙄 Like I said, all this stuff is well within our budget and my husband didn’t care until very recently, when his mother got into his head.

My MIL criticizes what I buy, says I can get much cheaper stuff at Kohl’s, ""look at all the drugstore products I use and how young I look!"", etc. She has been talking to my husband and talking about how she is saying as a woman that loves shopping that my spending habits are ridiculous. She started showing me $15 moisturizers I could buy from the drugstore, which, if that’s your cup of tea great but it’s not mine! I have also heard her shit talking the BMW my husband got me as a birthday present. She also criticized my business and said I am wasting my husband’s money by investing in it even though I am starting to make an income from it. On top of all this, she criticized my parenting because I gave the kids some pop tarts for breakfast. (My husband eats a ton of junk food so clearly she didn’t do a banging job at the whole mom nutritionist thing either.)

I was really pissed so yesterday I made her leave while my husband was in a long meeting. Packed up her stuff and left them by the front door. I said we don’t need her help anymore and that I could take it from here. She didn’t even argue much and just left. Honestly the kids were probably the most upset but they have since calmed down.

But my husband is pissed at me now. He says he understands her criticisms were getting under my skin but that we can’t manage the kids ourselves. He says what his mom said wasn’t that bad. I said this is my house too and I shouldn’t have to constantly live under criticism.

AITA for giving my daughter an ultimatum?,"Some background: We are not from the US. I have a (18M) son and (17F) daughter. They do decently well in school (my son has an average mark of 8/10 and my daughter has an average mark of 7/10). My son has always liked technology and the ""STEM"" fields. He has a dream to work at a large company developing robots. My daughter on the other hand is a bit more creative. She doesn't like math, science, or anything of that format. Her grades are an average of 4-5 in the STEM categories, while 8-9 in the humanitarian categories. 

They are in the same grade and will finish 12th grade this year (however they are at different schools). Then it is time for them to pick which uni to go to. There is an option offered for students to go abroad and study in a different country which they would both really like since our country is not developed, and I approve of this as it would give them life experience and teach them more as they will have higher quality professors. 

The issue with this is that it costs money. I can afford to send them both to a university in different countries if we sell our current apartment and I rent a smaller a smaller apartment to live in by myself until they come home and scrape by, as almost all of my salary will be going for their tuition costs, apartment, food, and other necessities. I am willing to do this, but only for my son, and I will explain why.

When he goes to a different country, he plans to study Computer Science and Mathematics as a dual-major. He takes it very seriously and has been studying every day (including the weekends) to make sure he succeeds at this university. He is very competitive and I couldn't be more proud of him.

My daughter on the other hand, not so much. She would like to study history which in my opinion simply is not worth the money. I have let her know of my stance of this, and I told her that if she wants my financial support she will have to go for a STEM-related field. We are not a rich family, we are very poor and I am not going to work 10+ hour shifts just for her to learn history. I told her she can go into psychology, or some kind of medicinal branch, but she said she wouldn't do well in school for that.

Now the larger problem comes in that when my son does move out to university, I will still have to cut down on a lot of costs, and the nearest university from us is a good 12+ hours away and they do not offer dorm rooms, so she basically has no choice even to go to university in our country.

AITA for not wanting to give my step daughter a room in our house,"So me (26f) and my OH (26m) are saving to buy our first house. OH has 5 year old daughter let’s call her Julie. We have Julie over to stay once a fortnight on the weekend because of work schedules. My bf says we should get ourselves on the property ladder quicker by opting for a small 2-bed house. I stated if we did that then Julie cannot have her own bedroom in the house and that maybe a 3-bed would be better. Obviously if we did get a 2-bed she would have a bed and toys etc, but also have other things in there like our wardrobe space and a dressing table. My dream is to always have a dressing room and big built in wardrobes and if I’m saving up to buy my own home and OH won’t get a 3-bed why should one whole room in the house be solely for her bedroom when she is there for 1 night in 2 weeks... Am I an asshole?.... I kind of feel like one

AITA for getting my girlfriend pregnant?,"Throwaway account, because I use my user name for everything lol.
So me (20M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been dating for about 2 years, but known each other for way longer. We are super close, and share everything. However, I feel like our relationship is falling apart. To start, I want a family. I want kids, a dog, the whole nine yards. She also wants this, but not until she's 25. I think that it's silly to want to wait for so long, because she doesn't work, studies online and doesn't have much of a social life. To me, there isn't any reason to wait. And then if we want lots of kids, she could be pregnant after the age of 35, which is dangerous anyway. But she's super adamant about it.
She also claims that she's asexual - despite the fact that we have sex at least once a month. From what I can read online, if you're asexual then you don't have sex at all. I told her this, and she said that it was because just before her period she's more sensitive so its physically enjoyable.
About 5 months ago, one of my friends had a baby, and we baby sat for an afternoon. Girlfriend was so happy and in love! So, about a month later, we had our ""monthly sex"". We didn't use condoms, but, no big deal, she just asked me to set a reminder to go to the chemist tomorrow. Except, I lied and just opened and closed the calender app without writing anything. I figured if she really didn't want a baby she would remember.
I'm sure you can guess, but she's pregnant! I am super happy and proud, but she was really scared and wanted an abortion. Eventually I talked her out of it, and it helped that we didn't have $300 to pay for it. But this pregnancy has just turned her into a fucking monster. She vomits All the time. At least three times a day. She's always begging me to smoke with at least three layers on because she says she can smell it all on me. And she's terrified to leave the house because of this covid stuff, even though we're in a super low risk area. And recently, we had a huge argument about how she hated being pregnant, and wanted an abortion. I reminded her that we didn't have the money, and she was to far along. Then she screamed at me that it was my fault anyways, because I should of reminded her to take the morning after pill. I told her that if she really didn't want to be pregnant she would have remembered anyways. At that point, she chucked three pillows at me, one after the other and walked away. 
I tried to have a calm and logical conversation, but she was just so angry and upset. I think most of it must have been the pregnancy hormones, because she's never been that angry before.
Anyways, a week later, here I am asking for reassurance that I'm doing this OK. I'd ask it if she was the arsehole, but it doesn't fit the acronym, plus it makes me sound a bit cocky.

WIBTA if I broke up with my girlfriend to date her friend?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So I’ve been dating this girls well call E casually for about two months. Things are good, but I honestly can’t see it going anywhere. She’s a great woman though.

She has this friend well call H. Dude, lemme tell y’all, she’s my dream everything. We have a much better connection than E and I do. There’s attraction and chemistry between us I can tell. Plus there’s just little things I she has done I can tell she’s into me. 

So I really just want to be with her. She’s the woman of my dreams. The only thing is I don’t really want to hurt E. She’s a good person who has done nothing to deserve this to happen to her. 

This sounds like some high school level drama, but we’re all mid to late 20s. I don’t want to be a scumbag, but as corny as it sounds, this is what my heart wants. WIBTA?


Edit: I just want to point out something when I say we’ve casually been dating I mean just that. We aren’t in a relationship officially. Hell we only see each other once or twice a week at most.


So yep, I’m going to break up with E. You people really do love up to you’re reputation for being miserable people. I’m going to do what I’m going to do. I should have never even posted this for a bunch of self righteous douche bags to weigh in on.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to sell a Muslim woman vodka?,"Just to start off with some context I guess, this happened in America in the state of New York. The liquor laws here are a bit odd compared to other states but in a liquor store the seller can reserve to right to not sell alcohol to anyone for any reason really. As long as the reason isn't a blatant prejudice against race/religion/sex. I work part time at a small liquor store while I'm working towards my bachelors degree in college. 

A Muslim woman wearing a hijab and a veil, and a younger man who I presumed to be her significant other walked into the liquor store as I'm working behind the counter. I said hello and asked if they needed any help finding anything, they both politely declined. After they wandered around for a bit and speaking in a different language they eventually pick out a vodka and come to the counter. I scan the bottle and ask for their IDs.

They both pull out New York IDs. I was fine with the man's ID but I couldn't see the woman's face. I could see the woman's face in the ID but I had no way to tell that it was her because of the veil. I told her that I wasn't sure if I could accept it because I couldn't tell if the photo ID was actually hers. The woman then said that she couldn't remove the veil for religious purposes. I then explained that I was sorry, and that due to the law I just couldn't accept the ID then and I refused to sell to them.

The woman seemed a bit disappointed but the man got a bit angry, saying that it was religious discrimination. I apologized again and just told him that I couldn't sell him the liquor unless I knew that the photo ID was actually her. The woman then rattled off her name and birthday without looking while I was still holding her ID card to prove it was her. As somebody who works in a liquor store this proves very little to me because people with fakes learn the names and the DOB on the ID all the time to make it seem like it's actually them. He then asked if she could just walk out of the store and if I could just ""sell it to him"". I told him I still couldn't because I knew she was with him. Then, he tried giving some excuse that they had just met outside and he doesn't even know her. At this point I was more than over it and just flatly said, ""Look, I can't sell this to you. Try a different store. I don't know what else to tell you.""

He kinda huffed and puffed again about religious discrimination and losing business before they both walked out. This confrontation made me feel a bit uncomfortable because I don't think it was about religious discrimination, I simply just couldn't see her face. I get that she doesn't want to take off the veil but how the heck am I supposed to know that the photo ID is actually her? AITA here? Was this actually discrimination?",Not the A-hole
AITA for briefly kicking my wife out of my house after she ruined my work?,"So I work as a luthier (building of string instruments ie basses, guitars, etc) and it is extremely tedious work. The slightest distraction or shaky hands could ruin a very expensive build.

I was commissioned to build a custom Les Paul esque electric guitar, I paid about $800 for raw wood and parts for a set-neck LP-type guitar and other materials that I wont bother listing.

It goes without saying that this was a very expensive build and I was building it for a renowned musician in my city so there couldn’t be any fuckups.

I was working on this for about a week and yesterday was almost done, I had just started the body work which takes extreme precision and patience. I used a high quality extremely expensive wood filler for this.

 I was almost done with this when my wife came in to bring me food, she opened the door loudly which startled the shit out of me and I jumped and accidentally poured a fuck ton of wood filler onto the body of the guitar and into one of the electronic compartments.

If you don’t know, the electronic compartments is where all of the wiring goes, it’s what makes an electric guitar electric. Very important.

It was completely ruined. I couldn’t wire the guitar if the compartment was almost full to the brim with filler. And it would’ve been extremely hard to get a clump of wood filler off of the body of the guitar.

I panicked and tried to pour it out and it ended up pouring on my hand and drying which fucking sucked. I was extremely pissed off so I told my wife to get out of my shop. 

I did something what I later regretted, out of anger I snapped the neck, which ruined it for sure. I went into my house to wash up and my wife was just sitting there watching tv.

I asked my wife to get something from the car, when she went outside I slammed the door shut and locked her out and calmly went back into my shop. My daughter was at my wife’s mother’s house at the time so she didn’t have to witness any of this by the way.

I went back to my shop and couldn’t repair the guitar, I had never been so angry lol. I just gave up and went to take a nap, all with my wife still outside. She had her car keys with her so she could’ve just drove somewhere so I don’t really understand why she was so mad and why she didn’t just do it.

I slept for a couple hours and when I woke up, figured I should let her back in even though she would lash out at me. I went up to the door and she was on the front porch crying. 

I let her back in and hugged her. Am I the asshole?",Asshole
AITA for expecting my wife to do more of the housework because I bring in more income?,"The title is essentially it in a nutshell.

My wife and I have been married for 4 years and have 1 kid and this is a constant disagreement. I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the ""management"" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?

I work more hours than she does.

You are all acting like rabid dogs and jumping on things I never said. I never said I do nothing. I never said I don't spend time with my child. All I said is that I want her to do more than me without complaining/fighting every step of the way. That's it. You're all projecting to outrageous extents.",Asshole
AITA for being on Tinder but only for a confidence boost?,"I posted a thread last night about an unrelated issue on AITA and mistakenly dropped this information in the comments. Even though the issue I asked about is completely separate, I'm getting crucified over the fact that I once made a Tinder last year while dating my girlfriend. 

Here's the thing, though: I only made it for a confidence boost. I never had any intention of cheating or even messaging these girls. I only got 2 matches anyway and they weren't even that attractive, at least not attractive enough that my girlfriend should have felt threatened by them. My girlfriend was upset about it when she found out. We sat down and I told her how I was feeling unappreciated especially since she never wakes me up with ""surprises"" anymore. We moved past it and our relationship has been good since then. But the Reddit hivemind is insisting I'm an asshole because I had a Tinder for one week a year ago that didn't lead to any  infidelity whatsoever. AITA?",Asshole
Aita for grounding my son,Last year my son (16) got purple highlights and I got mad because he was wasting his money on stuff he doesn’t need.

I told him it doesn’t matter if it’s a good reason or not what I say goes. He said when was it a rule that colored hair was not aloud I told him it was always banned and that he should of known with out me telling him and that he is grounded.

AITA for not tipping the pizza delivery guy who was 15 minutes late and had my pizza turn over in his car?,"Last night I ordered a Pizza from a chain pizza joint. I live pretty close to the store so they quoted 30 minutes for delivery time. 

45 minutes later this sweaty over weight ~28 year old comes up the drive way wearing 90s track suit pants up to his navel and covered in bubbles from being washed over a period of years. His chest was mostly covered in pimples and he had a beard stretching from his cheeks to his neck with no distinguishable indicator of where his mandible ended and neck started.

When he hands me the pizza which was at least hot I notice cheese is coming out the sides of the box where it opens. So I open the box hoping they loaded it with cheese to see that two slices are stuck to the roof of the box and the rest are separated and mushed. The ceiling of the box looks like an abstract art piece. 

So I calmly and nicely go “ok what happened here? This pizza was late and it’s been all messed up.”  

He returns fire with “ I don’t know bro the boss sent me out here when he was good and ready and sorry about the mess it fell off me [sic] seat when I slammed the brakes on at a red light”. 

I’m like whatever because the pizza is piping hot and clearly edible however I wasn’t going to tip because he messed up my pizza due to what I’m assuming was some kind of distracted/bad driving and he was calling me “bro” and seemed irritated that I wasn’t just accepting a late, turned over pizza without question. 

So I am like bye and go to close the door when this guy literally puts his hand out like in a cartoon or movie and I had to explain to him what happened and I don’t think tips should be mandatory. 

After I advised him he will not be receiving a tip from me he called me a “white asshole” (dude looked white to me) and kicked over my kids jack-o-lantern. 

Is tipping really mandatory? AITA for being a traditional tipper?",Asshole
AITA for denying acknowledgement that I am the father of this child?,"Some back story: I do not want children. When I was in college I had an exchange semester, I lived and studied in another country at this time.
When I was there I met a girl from a party, she was in her mid 30s and a native from said country.
I would go to her place once or twice a week for about 3 weeks and we’d go out for some drinks, go back to hers and have sex with protection.
We fell out of contact for a while and she text me saying she was pregnant and that the condom broke (she showed me pictures from scans she got at the hospital to prove it).
I was in disbelief because I knew I wore a condom, I told her I do not want children and offered to take her to a hospital as she was only a few weeks pregnant at the time. She declined and was adamant about keeping it. She said when she was younger she had an abortion and did not want to risk damaging herself going through with another one. 
I was extremely distraught that she could go through with this without my permission. She said she did not need my permission and I said I do not want anything to do with this baby or you and we will never speak again. I had only known her for a few weeks and I felt like I had been cheated. I deleted her and tried to block the whole event from happening from my memory. I vowed never to speak to her again and decided that this mishap was a sperm donation and I will have nothing to do with it.

We deleted each other and didn’t speak for 3 years.
I moved back to my own country.

3 years later I started receiving messages in my social media inbox saying she wants me to be involved in the child’s life. I ignored and blocked. She then started messaging my family members which forced me to explain what happened. A year later I started receiving letters for child custody from a lawyer in the post saying I had to respond. I didn’t.

AITA for pushing for foods that myself and coworker are allergic to be banned?,"Hi all! I am incredibly allergic to avocados. If I am in the same room as in that’s been cut open I break out in hives and my throat swells. I am allergic to many different fruits, but avocados are the worst.

My other coworker, let’s call him Mike, is allergic to peppers in the same way.

Most people in my workplace are very respectful of our allergies, and don’t eat anything or cut anything around us that we’re allergic to. Except this one woman, let’s call her Katherine. 

Katherine regularly brings in guacamole, whole avocados, etc. she tells me just to not eat any, despite me constantly telling her that being around that is bad. I’ve had bad reactions at work because of this. Last week, Mike walked into the kitchen and Katherine was cutting up some bell peppers. Immediate anaphylaxis for Mike. Katherine was complaining about it, saying she has a right to eat what she wants where and when she wants.

AITA for wanting to get high even though I’m the designated driver?,"Title sounds bad but please hear me out. My two friends and I want to go to the beach and get high. The beach is a bit far from where we are, so an Uber would be super expensive. As a result, we’ve been struggling to decide who the driver will be. One of my friends always drives and I felt bad so I said that either myself or the other friend should be the one driving.

We did Rock Paper Scissors and I lost, so I was the driver. No big deal. I just told them that I won’t smoke until we arrive at the beach, but they can smoke beforehand without me. I told them that once we get to the beach safely, I will smoke and get high but I will absolutely not drive until I’m sober again.

They think that I should not smoke and remain sober so that I can drive us back safely. I think that I’m also here to have fun and I don’t wanna just be their chauffeur. 

And to clarify in case it wasn’t clear: I’m going to absolutely wait until I’m 100% sober before driving (I’ve never driven under the influence and I never plan to). My friends just don’t want to wait around for me to get sober before they can go home, but I never get too fucked up. I smoke daily and know my limits. I know that I usually sober up after about an hour or two.

Edited to add: My friends are absolutely okay with a high driver. The guy I lost Rock Paper Scissors to was planning on driving high. The ONLY reason why they don’t want me to get high is because I refuse to drive them while high. If I were okay with driving under the influence, they’d absolutely allow me to get high and then proceed to drive them.",Asshole
AITA for sending a nude to an ex-boyfriend who I ran into at REI and he made a shitty remark about me losing weight? Husband is pissed.,"Friday I was at REI by myself. I ran into an ex boyfriend who id lived with for 4 years when I was in my early 20s (I'm 31 now). He was with this enormous woman and because he's still an immature slob, he was trying to act overly affectionate with her pretending like he didn't see me. He was in line behind (alone) me and he said hello. I said nice to see you too. He said somthing about losing weight. I said yeah I finally got my act in gear and do triahtlons and marathons now. He said I want my girlfriend to lose weight but I'm worried what would happen to her boobs. I said boobs are just fine if not better than before. He said well they don't look good from here. I was like wow you are still an asshole and I'm not 19 and able to be negged anymore. He said I was still a greedy piece of shit by my ring and the expensive camping mat I was buying. I turned around and ignored his continued comments.

It just ate at me all night so I texted a friend to see if she still had his number, she did so I took a topless mirror selfie and sent it to him. I captioned it ""does moo-cow's udders look this good!"" He just texted me back ""blocked"" which really made me laugh. 

I thought my husband would find it amusing because it's in the vein of his sense of humor but he was really pissed. He said he understood my desire to get back at David but that I went way too far in sending him the topless shot.

AITA for trying to joke with my gf,"I work a job that gets pretty boring this time of year. Me and gf have a 3 year old and she is a stay at home mom and gets lonely, so I text her throughout the day cause it’s no hassle to me. There is rarely a day I can’t talk so she knows if I don’t something is up. 

Today as I left for work she complained that I needed to stop leaving butter out cause she had to buy 3 new big tubs this week cause I keep forgetting. 

I pretended to react super offended and didn’t talk for a few hours. I was gonna come home with some of her fav food and surprise her that I wasn’t mad. She messaged me asking what was wrong and I told her I don’t like to be verbally abused over butter. She got really upset and told me she was sick of me and that I was selfish and not good for her ‘mental health’. I told her it was a joke but she needed to apologize because now she actually upset me calling me selfish when I’m sensitive to stuff like that. She blocked me on everything. I’ve joked like this before and she just rolled her eyes so idk why she unnecessarily blew up this time.

I called my mom to try talk to her and calm her down but my mom said that I needed to grow up and hung up on me. I don’t think I did anything wrong it’s just my sense of humour but I’m asking cause what my mom said. I think it was cruel of her to unload such heavy insults at a joke.

These jokes just write themselves.”

My wife accuses me of body shaming, but I think it’s fashion shaming. It’s sort of like an old guy dressing like he’s a teenager. While it’s her right to wear what she wants, I feel as if I can’t help but laugh if it looks ridiculous.

AITA for keeping using tinder in a relationship,"Edit: it was very useful to have a look from another perspective, thank you all for comments and questions to think about! App is deleted, conversation ahead

I (26f) met my boyfriend (27m) in Tinder like a year ago. For some first weeks I didn't really think this will work, so I kept using the app but soon just stopped swiping. We have also agreed on the concept of exclusive relations, as would feel uncomfortable in any kind of open ones. 

Apparently it became obvious tinder is a very good antistress: once I got mad at him or upset or something, I open the app with the initial idea ""oh, dear, you're not the last man on earth"" and close it soon with a great relief that my relations are actually very good and I don't need to go through exausting small talks and first dates again. Of course, I never try to match anybody or do it in front of him, only when I'm alone. I also share some nice guys with my single friend. So far it all looked as an ideal scheme to calm down and express my feelings in a constructive way.

But last week when we were in a journey, I showed something on the map from phone and Tinder sent push with some advertisement (you are in a new place, explore it! or smth like that). He looked upset for a moment but made some jokes on it, I've explained I sometimes discuss guys with a single friend (so, that's stupid but true) as I obviously can detect a nice guy, and we moved on. 

I wasn't feeling I was wrong until then. It looks like everything is good now, but I feel very bad as if I were him I would be upset too. Some part of me says I should stop doing it, but another is saying it's wrong as this thing successfully worked.

Ps I also feel this is kinda childish",Asshole

I know my intentions are pure with doing it,  as all I want to do is make sure Im doing as much right as possible and giving the right kind of support, but I still have a sense of guilt over it because now it's like I'm being secretive too,  and there's that whole two wrongs don't make a right mantra.

AITA for telling my coworker to stop wearing a high school branded jacket to work?,"My coworker John (65m) and I (23m) both work together as contractors in the construction industry. We buy most our work clothes from Opshop's because they get destroyed and unwearable within a couple of months. Anywho, on Monday, he rocks up to work wearing a new (opshop new) windbreaker jacket which I recognized straight away because it was my old high school jacket plus the fact that it has our high school emblem plastered on the front. 

I said ""are you seriously going to wear a high school jacket to work? Take it off, man. I've got another jacket for you.""

John is old but quite timid and I guess he took my tone as snarky (to be fair it kinda was) and didnt say anything back and just ignored me for the rest of the day. Today things were back to normal and he wore the jacket again but I didnt say anything about and we carried on as per usual. 

Now I wanna know if I was the asshole for even mentioning it the other day ? I personally think it's fucking weird to see a guy in his 60's wearing something that is part of the uniform for a high school but that could be my own problem since I only left that school 5 years ago and if I seen someone 40 years older than me wearing our uniform while I was still attending as a student, I'd be creeped out.",Asshole
WIBTA if I don’t tell a married couple that they have been exposed to another man’s semen because the risk of STD and pregnancy from the semen is so low?,"Throwaway because I don't want this connected to my account.

I had an ongoing fwb relationship with two parties. One is a single guy workaholic who is always frisky and I've been playing with him for over a year now. The other party is a married couple. The wife's kink is watching her husband have anal sex with another person and then have sex with her. The two parties don't know about each other but everyone involved is tested regularly.

About 6 weeks ago  I made plans with the couple. An hour before we met, I visited the single guy for some quick fun where he ended up having an orgasm inside me with anal. I didn't have any deep cleaning supplies with me so I just quickly showered and literally ran off to my meeting with the couple.

At the couple's condo, the husband used a lot of coconut body lotion (basically the same appearance and consistency of pearly white semen) on himself and on me to lubricate before engaging in anal. I still had a lot of semen inside my rectum from the first encounter but I didn't say anything...and basically let the husband do me, and I know he smeared a lot of the earlier semen on his penis and then he went on to have vaginal sex with his wife. 

Since that time the single guy and I have both been tested for STDs and are all negative again.

Today I got a message from the married couple the wife is pregnant (she thinks about 6 weeks, probably from our encounter). They're closing the marriage because she's now pregnant. While there is a theoretical risk that the pregnancy could be from the semen from the single guy, I feel like the chance is SO LOW that it's not worth mentioning a paternity test, even though by dates the pregnancy happened around the same time as the event in question. Plus, the single guy and the husband have very similar appearances so it's not like the baby's appearance will raise any suspicion. 

Basically, I feel like it's ok to leave well enough alone in this case. Am I thinking about this the right way?

TL;DR: I exposed a married couple to another man's semen and now the wife is pregnant. STD risk is extremely low. But there is a theoretical risk that the pregnancy is from another man's semen based on the sexual activity we had and the timing. The risk is so low, though, that I feel like I should leave well enough alone and let everyone go on their merry way...",Asshole

One of them was a jewelry store — nothing fancy, just fun stuff. I tried on a few things, and I mentioned to him that I liked one of the rings because it would be fun to wear at work (but I wasn’t that serious) + that I liked one of the bracelets because it would go well with a bunch of my outfits.

Fast forward to yesterday, and he surprised me with a gift. But it was the ring and not the bracelet. My first reaction was, “You’re funny.” And then I explained that I really wanted the bracelet more and that I was disappointed he didn’t get that.

He said he thought I liked them both and he got me the one I seemed more excited by. But I was still disappointed because I didn’t really want it.

Now he’s bummed out at my reaction, and I’m upset he didn’t get me the right gift. I thought it was pretty clear that I wanted one and not the other.

AITA for blaming my fiance for ruining my turnip run in Animal Crossing?,"As some of you may know, turnips are the #1 way to make money in this game, and only available for purchase on Sundays until noon. I woke up before my fiance to feed the cats, check turnip prices, and compare with our friends. At 11 am, our friend got back to me that their turnips were selling at a good price and opened their gates for us. My fiance was already playing and had just gotten onto a mystery island, but it was just a basic island so I told him to hurry up and leave so we could take turns buying turnips. He ignored me and continued to fish on the mystery island, not leaving until I made him at 11:30. By the time he had finished buying turnips and checking out our friend's shops, it was 11:45.

I only had 15 minutes to clear out my inventory (I had been gardening last night so it was full of flowers that I couldn't just chuck in storage), run to the bank only to remember that I was pretty broke (I had been dedicating my time to gardening and other nonprofitable beautification projects for *our* island while this stinky bastard man made all the money he wanted without helping), and rush to beat the loading screens. I was in such a hurry that I didn't realize until I was already there that I could have brought my pear hoard to sell for more turnips, but by then it was too late.

I was upset with him for taking so long on the mystery island and blamed him for running out of time, telling him so. He gave me an emotionless non-apology, which pissed me off more than the turnips. Then he tried to backtrack when he saw that I was turning from disappointed to mad by offering me his turnips. But I don't want his handouts, I wanted to earn the money myself! So I declined his offer and would accept nothing less than a real apology. (Although is an apology that I have to force out of him even a real apology?) He claims that while he shouldn't have stayed on the mystery island for so long, it wasn't his fault that I forgot my fruit. My counter-argument is that I wouldn't have forgotten if I wasn't in such a rush, and if he hadn't left me with such little time I would have been able to go back and get them.

I have since gotten over it, but I still need to know. AITA?

Edit: A lot of responses seem to be ""it's just a game, chill"", so I feel the need to clarify that this wasn't a real ""fight"" or anything.

I noticed the guy in front of me was holding the door open for me, so I rushed up to the door so he could go. I was still trying to zip the zipper when I noticed he was still standing there, AND his wife was at the second door, holding IT open for me. 

Ok, nice, but not needed. I can open doors myself and I was still trying to get my keys zipped up. I gave them kind of a confused look (I wasn't ready to go through the door, I thought the door-holding was approaching weird territory...)

I said ""you can go"", and went back to the zipper. The guy actually says ""If I let go the door will hit you!"" I was literally standing in front of the door, he was ""saving"" me from a 1/2 inch worth of a slight bump.

They finally leave, I get my zipper zipped and enter the restaurant in time to hear the wife saying ""...didn't even say thank you!!"" and generally cursing me out.

They immediately were being led to a table and walking away. I was SEETHING. I have a personal history of abuse/low self esteem and working on standing up for myself. I touched her shoulder and said ""Excuse me!"" 

She starts flipping out about calling the police. I merely explained that I didn't *ask* anyone to hold a door open for me and I was trying to deal with my zipper. The husband said again the door would've ""hit"" me if he let go (???). Things were getting heated and I walked away. 

I was going to leave the restaurant, but honestly I felt I didn't do anything wrong with calling someone out on bad-talking me. I was a little distracted with my purse and perhaps socially oblivious for a second. 

I feel the whole door-holding thing was overdone and they were a little *too* offended that I didn't kiss their asses over it. I hold open doors for people using the door at the same time as me, I don't make a huge production of it and play doorman. And if nobody thanks me for it it's not the end of the world.",Asshole
AITA for being honestly and telling my (19M) best friend (18F) she’s too hot for her boyfriend (20M)?,"So I’ve been best friends with my female best friend (let’s call her Izzy) for about 8 years now. We met in the 5th grade and have been pretty inseparable since. 

Izzy is honestly really pretty. When people see Izzy or think about Izzy they for sure think she is incredibly attractive. Like insanely attractive. All through high school almost every guy in our class would constantly ask me to set them up and talk to her for them and just stupid shit like that. Also I guess a lot of girls were jealous of Izzy because she basically only had me and a few other guy friends and one girl friend. She never was interested in any of the guys at our high school and honestly I always thought she knew she was too attractive for them. 

So we are off to college now. We have talked about her sleeping with a few guys but when she shows me pictures I can see they are all incredibly attractive like her. So imagine my surprise when she just started dating the most average looking guy I have ever seen in my life. I was so shocked and incredibly dumbfounded. When I asked her only girl friend what the hell was up she told me apparently the guy was really really nice and funny and a really good lay. I was still kind of confused but didn’t say anything about it.

Yesterday Izzy showed me a picture of them hiking and she something along the line “isn’t he so cute? I love him so much.” I just bluntly said I don’t find him very attractive. She got kind of flustered and asked me what I meant. I ended up telling her I thought he was incredibly average and was wondering why she was with such an average looking guy when she could have anyone and she got really mad at me. I told her I was just trying to be nice and tell her she’s worth so much but she only got angrier. She stormed off and later sent me a long text telling me she was hurt I thought she was that shallow and that it’s not up to me who she dates. She claims she needs to put our friendship on pause for a little while and I’m honestly just shocked. I don’t think I said anything all that hurtful or rude. AITA?

Me and my froends go out at least once a week for lunch to catch up. We’re all 55+. Today, we were discussing my friend Brett’s new girlfriend, who happens to be 24 while he’s 58. Weird I know but they’re happy and that’s all I care about.

We went to a restaurant that’s known for their beautiful servers. Not a hooters, they don’t focus on it, but a local Asian place that’s colloquially known to have attractive servers. Doesn’t matter because we technically weren’t talking about servers, we were discussing my buddies girlfriend and the attractiveness of younger women, THEORETICALLY.

A bartender who was nearby told us to quit talking like that out of respect for the servers, but again we weren’t discussing them, he was assuming, and regardless it wasn’t his business, so I told him that. He immediately brought us our check, though he wasn’t our server, without a word, implying we should leave... I think our privacy was violated, AITA?

"AITA for revealing to a prospective employer of my former employee that he shares pay information with coworkers, possibly costing him a job?","To preface this, I run a small business with fewer than 20 employees. I have a former employee who we will call Adam. He left on good terms, but it came to my attention months after his departure that either during or after his employment term, he had told coworkers his payrate, asked for and acquired theirs, and openly shared this set of information with multiple people at the company. This has caused a number of ongoing problems, productivity and jealousy related, amongst staff.

I understand under federal law it is illegal to terminate someone for discussing pay with coworkers, and I want to emphasize that he was not terminated at all but rather resigned his position after finding another job. 

I was recently contacted by another employer seeking a reference on Adam. I was truthful, said the good, the bad, and also disclosed the behavior noted above. Several weeks later, Adam emailed me asking if someone from XYZ company had called for a reference on him, and If so, what I had said, since he thought the job interview went well yet he wasn't given an offer. I was honest with him, told him that I found out what he had been doing, thought it was noteworthy due to the problems it caused and therefore felt obliged to mention it. Whether the prospective employer felt that this type of behavior was acceptable was fully up to them. Adam then became angry and threatened a lawsuit against me for retaliating against him for doing something that was fully legal. I have not yet responded to the threat. I believe he was just venting and has no actual intention of filing a lawsuit. 

The way I see it is, at the end of the day all I did was relay the facts. Adam was the one to engage in the questionable behavior, and XYZ company was the one to turn him down for the job based on this behavior. So am I the asshole here?",Asshole

No biggie, everyone has to start somewhere right? While flirting with her I(20) brought up that I could be teaching pretty much everything that I know. She was pretty excited about it. However last night as we talked before making out she brought up the fact that she didn't like how her vag looked like. I have only felt hers once before and it was during night time outside (just fingering, nothing else). So I didn't really see it before however I knew what was coming up. And she is correct, it doesn't really look appealing to me for being an outie. By telling her that I will teach her we even brought up stuff I could do to her so she knows what I would be able to do on other girls like giving head to her or doing 69 (eventhough I haven't even done it myself yet lol) and all kinds of stuff.

AITA for going off on a co-worker that refused to use my pronouns?,"While I was finishing up undergrad, I worked at a well known coffeeshop that we'll call Barstucks. I've been out as non-binary for nearly seven years now, and I feel pretty comfortable talking about it. Sometimes people make a mistake and misgender me (I have truly massive tits, so its understandable) and if it's a stranger that I'll never see again I'll just ignore it, but if it's someone I see on a regular basis I will gently correct them by simply saying ""they"" just as a reminder.

Most of my coworkers were super cool about it. One person even told me that after talking with me about gender, they even began questioning their own identity. Some Barstucks locations even provide their employees with pins to wear with their pronouns, so I happily began wearing one with ""they/them"" on it. But there was one coworker, Aaron, that just could not get his shit together.

Aaron was 32 years old at the time when all of this was happening, so there was about ten years of age difference between us. And he just could not stop calling me ""miss"" nubs. Even if I used she/her, calling me ""miss"" just sounds so infantilizing and condescending. It really rubbed me the wrong way. So for the first few weeks of him doing this, every single time I would calmly say ""I'm not a miss."" He didn't stop. Eventually I took it to our boss, who had us sit down. In that meeting, Aaron told me that it goes against his religious beliefs to use non-binary pronouns, and since he's experienced racism then I should have to experience this. The second part didn't make any sense to me, but whatever.

After seriously 45 minutes of this meeting (where he still wouldn't stop misgendering me, even in front of our boss) he agreed to just use my name, and that was fine with me. Except he didn't stop after that. So, whenever he addressed me by  ""miss"" nubs, I just ignored him. More than once, this resulted in drinks not being handed out, or made at all. I just acted like I couldn't hear him. He still didn't stop.

This went on for months, until finally one night when we were closing and he said, ""excuse me, lady,"" while trying to get past me, and I lost it. I started yelling. I don't remember verbatim what I said because I was so angry, but I know I didn't curse or say anything inappropriate, just that he was way out of line and that there's a reason no one on staff likes him, and that karma has a funny way of dealing with bigots. He walked out and left me to close by myself.

"AITA for asking TSA to let me and my young son into the gating area, without boarding passes, to watch airplanes take off?","My three-year-old son and I had some time to kill today, so we rode a train to the airport (he's at the age where he's obsessed with trains, trucks, airplanes, cars, etc.). When we got there, he wanted to see if we could watch airplanes land and take off. We couldn't see any from the windows in the ticketing and terminal areas. So I approached the TSA transportation security officer manning the place where they check your license. I showed him my license and he asked for my boarding pass. I stated that I did not have one and that we were just hoping to sit in the concourse and watch some airplanes take off and land. The TSA officer stated that I needed a boarding pass to be let into the part of the airport past the TSA security checkpoints. He then went further and stated that if I didn't have one and didn't plan to buy one, we needed to leave the airport immediately. So we left. 

I thought this was ridiculous. I showed my driver's license. And we would've gone through the usual TSA security theater (including us, there were maybe a dozen people in the airport, so it's not like we were holding anyone up).  And the risk of me somehow sneaking onto an airplane with my three-year-old and a stroller would've been very remote, given that airlines check your boarding passes a separate time before they let passengers board the plane. 

The only basis I can think of for TSA refusing us entry is that there's some federal statute or TSA regulation (or other TSA security procedure) requiring anyone who wants to be in the airport concourse to have a boarding pass on their person at all times, even if they just want to go there to buy a slice of Sbarro's pizza at the airport food court. But if there is, it's not like this TSA officer cited it, and it wasn't posted any of the walls in the area.

AITA For going on Tinder while casually dating someone who is going to leave the US in 2 months?,"So I've been dating this girl for about a year now, and things have been going really well. She is moving back to Italy in 2 months because her work visa/permit is expiring (she was a student then got a temp gig afterwards for experience).

The thing is, we always kind of knew it was going to be over at some point, and I was totally fine with it because I'm not ready to settle down anyways. We were ""kinda"" serious but also not because of the circumstances, though I did remain faithful to her throughout our time together.

Since she is leaving soon, I decided to hop back on tinder and begin see what's out there. I'm not even using it seriously, just swiping for fun and when I get matches I don't even talk to them, literally just seeing what's out there for when she leaves.

AITA for expecting my boyfriend to immediately accept my gender identity?,"First Reddit post!

My boyfriend and I (early 20s) have been together for 3 years, and we have been living together for the last 6 months. I came out to him and our friend group as non-binary a few months ago, and since then I have been experimenting with they/them pronouns. He was super supportive of this, but he is non-binary too so I assumed he would be (he still uses he/him pronouns though). 

As I've been figuring out my gender identity, I've started to drift more towards the masculine side of things (I'm female-bodied) and have been considering taking testosterone injections, and maybe even using he/him pronouns. I brought this up to my boyfriend in a hypothetical and non-serious way, something along the lines of ""hey what if I medically transitioned"", and his response was basically that if I did, we would have to have a serious talk about whether to move forward in the relationship. He said he'd always be there for me, but not necessarily romantically. 

This was very upsetting to me, because we have been so madly in love for so long without ever having any indication of breaking up. I felt totally blindsided by his response, especially because I wasn't telling him that I was GOING to medically transition or become a man or anything, I was just kind of thinking out loud. He's also bi, so it's not like he would automatically not be sexually attracted to me if I was a man. But, he's never had a romantic relationship with a man.

I immediately started bawling, because this has all been very confusing for me and he has been my rock up until now. He said that he's allowed to have his reaction, and that it's a lot for him to deal with especially because he wanted a family with me one day. He mentioned that taking testosterone can cause infertility if you're female-bodied, which I didn't know. He didn't say this, but he is from very traditional family that he doesn't plan on ever coming out to, and right now we can look like a cis straight couple, but if I medically transitioned that would not be true anymore and I think that's definitely a factor for him. 

We ended the conversation with him saying to just let him know when I was more sure of my identity, and then we would talk about it. That was yesterday, and since then he's been asking me at every juncture if I know what my identity is yet, which I obviously don't because I still have to try out different things to see what feels right. I keep telling him this.

AITA for blocking contacts on my bf phone?,"
I‘m pretty sure IATA but still would love some feedback. Throwaway for obvious reasons and on mobile.

My bad [m34] and I [f30] have been together for a little more than three years now. The beginning of our relationship wasn’t that great, we argued a lot but somehow couldn’t seem to end it. After about a year, things went slowly but steadily better and I thought we were in a pretty good spot this year. During the summer, I got put on a work project in a different city for three months, where, due to project deadlines, I couldn’t come back every weekend. This as such isn’t a problem - we always had the greatest respect for each other’s work commitments.

When I came back in September he told me he wants to end things. He said he never really wanted this relationship and is truly unhappy, but never figured a way to leave me without breaking me, so he stayed „for my benefit“. The time apart were what he needed, he said, to get to the point he finally wanted to live his life again and leave me. I‘m not gonna pretend I took it well. I cried and begged and pleaded with him, cutting things short - in the end he agreed to give it „one last try“, but I am feeling very insecure and uneasy. While he was in the bathroom a couple days ago, I noticed he hadn’t locked his phone. I know snooping is bad, and nothing good comes of it, but I did it anyways. I found a conversation with an ex-girlfriend, starting with him sending happy birthday in August and them chitchatting about life and her kind of inferring they could potentially meet up when she was in town for an event. His last message didn’t really react to that and she hadn’t replied to him in a couple days. The other message was from a new Facebook friend, from the sounds of it someone he met at a friends wedding in July where I couldn’t come due to work. They where chatting and she asked him if he wanted to join her for a New Year’s Eve Party in our city. Apparently she was currently going alone. He replied he didn’t want to commit to anything on New Year’s Eve yet but indicating the party sounded good. In none of the messages to those girls did he ever made any reference to having a girlfriend. 

Now, I am sure he didn’t and wouldn’t cheat as long as we are officially together. But I felt in my rush of panic and emotions that he might see those conversations as encouragement to break up with me as he has „options“ and just went ahead and blocked both conversations. I don’t think he can find out (the remaining conversations in WhatsApp/Facebook looked the same as before), however I do feel a bit shitty about it. For once because I would always have said to never do this if anybody had asked me. On the other hand, because this alone won’t save our relationship and if it ever came out, he would be rightfully furios.

WIBTA if i refuse to speak to my mother unless she uses my chosen name,"Throwaway because my mother has a record of finding my social mediaspl
So here's the deal: I'm trans and still live at home, and will probably be living at home for another couple of years minimum. 
My mother, while she is aware that I'm trans, absolutely refuses to use the correct pronouns or my name, and she's spent the past few weeks doing extreme mental gymnastics in order to try and explain to me why I'm wrong and she shouldn't have to use the name and pronouns I ask her to use.
For the record, this is not about transitioning. I haven't asked her to support me through transitioning, or to help me get HRT or surgery or anything of the sort. All I've asked is for her to call me by the right name and pronouns.
It's been a couple of weeks since i first asked her (i was out to her already, but i hadn't been making an issue of it) and I'm getting a little sick of trying to explain my position and nicely ask her to respect me, so I'm considering just saying 'that's great but that isn't my name and I won't be answering to it anymore' and refusing to speak to her unless she'll respect me.
Something to consider: my younger brother still lives at home and it would probably be difficult for him if I just straight up stopped talking to my mother.

The situation was very obvious we were almost hit, but we weren't and we had the green light and yeah I was looking at other drivers too which is how I avoided the car.






I guess she took a picture of me and posted it on Facebook and we have a mutual friend who shared the post with me. I feel like this is an overeaction. My friend said I was an asshole, but its MY CAR and its not like I said the pax is a shit driver or that woman cant drive.",Asshole
AITA For Being Hungry at a Work Lunch,"Can hardly believe this is an issue but here goes,

I work on a small team at a medium sized corporation. One of my more senior teammates (not my manager) got a intern for the Winter and wanted to take her out to lunch. He invited all of us to go with him. When we got to the restaurant I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat so I ended up ordering two different entrees so I could try different things. Senior teammate asked if I skipped breakfast or something and I laughed it off. I figured it would be fine since it's on the corporate card, right? Wrong. Turns out management didn't approve the lunch but my teammate thought it was important to do anyway as a nice gesture to our intern so he ended up putting down his card. The meal came out to $100 between the five of us, with my food totaling $45. 

To top it all off, the food wasn't even that good so I ended up~~ sending both entrees back half eaten~~ only eating half of each. I don't think it's my fault that the food was bad or even that I was starving, so I can't understand why my teammate would be upset at me. He's asked me to limit my eating if we ever go out to lunch again, like, come on dude? Hopefully you kind folks can tell me what I can say to him to get him to move on. 

So folks, AITA?

EDIT: Everyone's saying I'm am asshoke for ""sending the food back"" but I just let the server clear the table all right? Hopefully that changes things.",Asshole
AITA For convincing my ex boyfriend to not tell his mother that I cheated on him?,"My boyfriend and I had been dating for over a decade, and I genuinely love him. He is THE nicest person I know, but due to some differences between us during the past few months, I used sex with other people as an outlet and cheated on him.

He found out and broke up with me, and I fully understand and respect his decision. I am seriously not this type of person and I am a good human being, I just happened to do something bad.

His mother and I have been close for a long time. She absolutely adores me and I love her too, we have a very close relationship. She has taught me how to knit, and I have taught her how to make presentations and stuff.  We bond really well.

We are really close, and I asked my ex if he could hide my cheating. It is something between me and him, and no one else needs to know about it. Thankfully, he agreed and told his mom that we had an amicable breakup due to mutual differences. I still visit his mom at times and he ignores me, which hurts a lot...but he is friendly enough at times and even smiles at me when I am around his mother.

I explained my friend the complex situation I am in and she told me I am being an asshole by letting my ex not have any room to vent since he has told everyone that it was an amicable breakup and we are still friends. Honestly, it was a mutual decision and he agreed to it, so I do not think I have done anything wrong when it comes to keeping it between ourselves.

Would love a fresh perspective, thanks!

EDIT: I feel like a lot of you are calling me a bad person because I cheated. If my boyfriend broke up with me, I think I have suffered the consequences. I am a good person and I try to be a better one each day, it's complicated. I genuinely want opinions on the mutual decision my boyfriend and I made to not tell his mother. I did beg and plead, but in the end, it was an agreement from both sides.",Asshole
AITA for firing an employee who didn't participate in company sponsored events?,I am the lead senior visualization artist on my team and had to make a decision to let somebody go on Friday. The problem was that she never participated in company sponsored events or made any indication that she was interested in going. Company cookout? No show. Company pod outing to skiing? No show. Even the mixer that was held after work \*in the building\* and she didn't show. In addition to this in morning meetings on projects she is very quite and sometimes doesn't say a word. Unfortunately had to have a conversation with the other senior artists and we all agreed that this position needs somebody who is communicative and out going so we decided to let her go and try to fill the position with somebody else. When I told my wife about it she told me that I may have jumped the gun a bit and should have mabe brought this issue up with the employee again before making the choice.

AITA for wanting to keep my daughter home from school after her teacher died?,"My daughter Sadie is in second grade and is 7 years old. Over this past weekend, her teacher passed away from a heart attack very suddenly. They asked parents to wait after dropoff on Monday and told us in the auditorium, and gave us the option of telling our kids ourselves or being told as a class. My wife, who was doing dropoff, opted to let my daughter stay and be told with the class which I don't agree with. When she called and told me what happened, I insisted she go back and pick Sadie up and bring her home.

I kept my daughter home Monday and yesterday. Before bed, my wife mentioned bringing Sadie to school tomorrow and I put my foot down. This is a serious traumatic event and we should deal with it as a family. Her school is very secular and I don't want her exposed to confused conversations from other 7 year olds and teachers who can't say anything religious about death and what happens when you die. I think we should keep Sadie home this week until it blows over at school. Another reason I'm worried is that her teacher was about the same age as my and my wife's parents and I don't want her to get any ideas about her grandparents dying. Her teacher was overweight and not as fit as my parents and my wife's dad (though her mom is overweight) so I don't want her to think they're just going to drop dead too.

My wife thinks she should be with her classmates and said the handouts from the school said that that would be better for the kids, but it also says they won't be discussing religious topics like heaven and hell and that they'll be sticking to a normal routine unless a kid asks for counseling. I think we're better off just keeping her away from this mess and teaching her what our family believes. My wife thinks it's cruel because Sadie wants to go back and be with her friends, but I don't want to let a 7 year old call the shots. My wife also had plans this week but it's nothing important that she can't reschedule for something this important.

AITA for getting mad at my GF for falling asleep during a movie i'm trying to show her?,"So this is it straight up, when I (32M) watch a movie with my GF (29F) many times iv already seen it and i'm trying to SHARE it with her. During the movie she inevitably drifts in and out or just falls asleep altogether (were talking about the 9p-10p area, she gets up around 7a normally, sometimes 8a). When she falls asleep though it feels like shes just spitting what i'm trying to share with her back in my face (i'v clearly explained that I trying to watch this movie with her before we start it). From my perspective the movie is an interesting thing that I like for various reasons and i'm trying to show it to her out of excitement so that we could both get excited about it (i'm trying to explore it with her). It would be comparable to if I found some weird bug or something outside, I would want to come and show it to her out of the excitement of sharing that weird thing/experience with her(Movies just take longer to show but to me its essentially the same concept to me). When she falls asleep it tells me that she doesn't care about what i'm trying to show her, that's disappointing sure but what's more frustrating is that it's like i'm wasting my time showing her this thing when I could be doing something else, id say both parts are equally disappointing though. This explanation applies to many aspects of how I function as a person, I try to show people things that I like so that we can bond/explore that thing together, so that we can expand our relationship through that thing together.

It's fine with me if a person doesn't like a thing I'm trying to share with them but I wish people would either just be more honest about what their true level of interest is in the thing or know themselves better. Or even better do some leg work on their end and throw some shareable things at me that we could share/potentially bond over.

When she falls asleep in movies though it makes me not want to share movies with her because I'm anticipating that she's just going to fall asleep so what's the point. What ends up happening is I'm sitting on the couch watching the movie AND watching her drift in and out which frustrates me and puts me in this position of ""should i just turn it off?"" or ""Should I wake her up and rag on her about falling asleep?"". Me having to sit in front of a movie I'm trying to watch with her and having to basically baby sit her / coax her into staying awake is pretty ridiculous IMO, I mean shes not a child right? Anyways, AITA here?? If it's just something we're watching that we don't care about then it doesn't really matter but when its a GOOD movie I'm trying to show her, it's different. I will also mention she even drinks coffee beforehand to try and stay awake and she will still fall asleep.

Thanks in advance for any comments / insights regarding this.

AITA for pushing my sister too hard at the gym?,"I (23M) am on vacation with my family. There is a gym in the hotel. My parents detest exercising but my sister works out often so I asked her (19F) if she wanted to do a workout with me. I never worked out with her before. She said she was down and wanted to do everything I usually do. I’m pretty jacked. I warned her that my full body workout might be too hard for her, but she’s a determined cookie. 


The hotel gym only has dumbbells up to 50 lbs so I’m not getting much of a sweat in. I do 3 sets of 10 reps for each lift. I pretty much max out on each exercise while my sister used like 20 lb dumbbells for chest press and 10 lb dumbbells for skullcrushers. I pushed her to not give me half-assed form and to push through until the last rep. 


We then moved on to planks. I could hold it for over 5 minutes, but I set it at 3 minutes. She was wobbling after 2 minutes, but I was encouraging her to push through and get stronger. She kept wobbling and collapsed with 20 seconds to go. She just laid on the floor for a few minutes telling me to continue with my workout. She was fine after a few minutes. I continued my workout for another 10 minutes before calling it a day. 


My parents asked us how the workout went. My sister said she almost fainted. My parents asked her what happened because she has never fainted when working out by herself. My sister said I pushed her too hard. My parents were yelling at me for almost making her black out. I said I legitimately thought she could handle the workout because she looks pretty fit and she tells me she goes to the gym a few times a week. My sister said it’s not my fault and she should have just stopped when she was seeing stars. My parents were mad at me for a while for pushing her too hard.",Asshole
"AITA for being ""ungrateful"" for an electronic gift that my grandmother got me (that I saw as a ticking time bomb)? WIB if I took it to the recycling center?","My birthday was yesterday. For some time now I've been expressing that I wanted to upgrade my PC (the components were aging quite a bit) and so I made a list of the parts I want and gave it to my dad, who sent it off to various family members to contribute. I'd contribute too.

I bought the graphics card and SSD, Dad bought the motherboard and RAM, Aunt got the me the processor and Grandma got me the power supply. (Dad tasked them, I didn't. I don't use Facebook because it's full of Karens.)

Now note that I had given everyone a specific part, within a reasonable price point, and they would get a huge deal on Black Friday, the day before my birthday.

Come my birthday, I turned 18 and everyone was to congratulate me for becoming an adult. Cheers and conversation over really good food was had. It was a great time.

Then I got my gifts. Everyone got me exactly what I wanted, and I expressed my greatest gratitude and thanks, and gave them a hug.

And here comes Grandma, with the power supply unit that she was tasked with.

Now I didn't ask for anything outrageously expensive (like those $200 RGB fully modular 80 Plus Gold power supplies with Japanese capacitors), but I did ask for a 750W supply with partial modularity that was around the $100 price point, and said good PSUs cost a lot.

I get my gift, and it's a unit from a brand I've never heard of called Logisys.

Again, I give my grandma the utmost gratitude, but tell her I am a little concerned. That I've never heard of this brand before and don't see any certification on it, and it looks very sketchy.

Grandma says she got it because it was cheaper and would still deliver on what I needed.

I then calmly explain that she needs to be careful with off-brand power supplies, as a lot of the cheap ones often have shoddy soldering, wiring, insulation and capacitors, and don't have any certification or testing. And if I put this in my system, my PC could potentially be fried.

My mom starts jumping on me and saying ""Stop being ungrateful, she put a lot of thought into getting that for you"" And Grandma and most others take her side.

But a few take mine and I tell her that there's a reason that you shouldn't buy unverified electronics from China, because they're often riddled with problems.

Eventually it turns into a small debate between family members about ""gratefulness"" and Chinese products and ""it's the thought that counts"", which kinda soured the mood and made me feel pretty bad. It only got resolved when dessert and coffee were ready.

Mom and Grandma gave me the stink eye for a moment and I just ate my cheesecake away from them.

Either way now I'm stuck with a piece of Chinese junk that I wouldn't dare put into my build. I think I might get myself a good one from Amazon on Cyber Monday.

Really was I in the wrong to complain about the unit I got? And would I be even more of an asshole if I discreetly recycled it?",Asshole
WIBTA If I reported my HS Counselor for being insensitive about my mental illness,"UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who commented, I truly appreciate it. I will NOT be reported my counselor to the school board, but my mom might still be taking to him about it in the coming days. When I had initially posted this the incident had occurred maybe an hour prior and the emotions were still fresh. 

To everyone who says I shouldn't get extra time because I am in an AP course or because its unfair to the other students or what ever reasons you listed, respectfully that's was not the point of this post. Honestly, watching people hash it out in the comment section about accommodated tests taking environment made me question if I wanted the accommodation. I actually expressed these woes to my case carrier and she ensured me that this was not special treatment, and reminded me that the only people who have a say in the matter is my teacher, parents, counselor, and case carrier because they know the ins and outs of students with 504 Plans and what I'm going through. 

To everyone calling me a snowflake, yes my anxiety has been especially bad this past month and that is partially my fault. I overloaded myself with AP courses and 3/4 of the ones I'm taking I'm excelling in them, which is why it was so frustrating to me that I could not pass math. But regardless of any of this, I am managing my anxiety as my family, myself  and therapist work towards a more normal life, but until there is a magical cure for me, my brain is going to keep misinterpreting situations and panicking excessively. My goal is to understand when this is happening and reverse it or stop it and decrease the frequency of it happening. 

To anyone saying the real world is going to break me, I'm sure it will. it breaks everyone but giving the things I've been through Im sure Ill overcome it just like everyone else.

Since it isn't clear, I have a 504 Plan meaning the Law recognizes my anxiety as a disability, meaning all accommodations that are agreed upon by my case carrier, teachers, counselor etc  IS THE LAW. Meaning if teachers don't abide by it they would be BREAKING THE LAW

I (F16) have diagnosed anxiety and panic disorders that allow me to request meetings that could better my learning environment.

Currently I am struggling greatly in my AP math class and have taken multiple steps towards improving my grade. I meet with a tutor for 2 hours twice a week and I meet with a math teacher during lunch for more help on top of that. Even after all the help my anxiety continued to get in the way and my parents decided that I needed a calmer test taking environment and extra time to complete the tests. This was after 3 panic attack surrounding my current status in math.

Today myself, my teacher, my counselor, my mother, and my case carrier met to discuss my options. They pitched to me the option of taking the test in my case carriers room and i would ~~receive as much time as i needed~~  extra time to complete the test ( i do not know how much extra time and i apologize for any misunderstanding), as long as I continued to see my tutor and the math teacher for help. Before I could agree my counselor said that “you are letting your nerves in the way of things, everybody has nerves you just gotta get over them and stop letting them affect you.” I was incredibly offended by his statement and I told him point blank, he said that I was taking what he said the wrong way. I said to him, “ I would expect you of all people to understand that my brain and everyone else’s brain works a lot differently when it comes to things like this and i would except you to know how far I’ve come in managing my anxiety and how hard i’ve works towards getting better.” I stayed quiet for a while, crying, before agreeing to the option they pitched to me. I spoke with my mom and she agreed that what he said was insensitive and said she would speak to him.

Later in the day he called me into his office and he asked me if there was anything we needed to talk about and I again told him point blank that what he said offended me and he said that he was sorry for offending me, again i asked him point blank if he was sorry i was offended or sorry he offended me. He told me straight up, “I am not sorry for what I said, i am not going to argue with you, you are misinterpreting my words and that’s that.” The conversation ended there and again I left crying.

I told my mom that i want an honest apology from him otherwise i would take the matter to someone of higher authority. My mom said that would be taking it too far, but i have been wronged many times by people i trust simply because they refuse to learn and accept that anxiety disorders are real and affect everyone in different ways and he should know this since he’s worked with students for decades",Asshole
AITA For Bringing My Dog to a Dog Friendly Workplace??,"I’m equally baffled and upset that HR has forbidden me from ever bringing my dog to work again even though my workplace is explicitly dog friendly. 

Here’s what happened. I brought my dog to work one day last month like I always do. My dog is quite large (doesn’t fit in a carrier) so one of my coworkers asked me how I bring my dog in every day. I mentioned that I bought one of those service dog vests online so that I can bring my dog on the subway.  (Dogs are otherwise disallowed) 

Fast forward a week later and   I’m called into a meeting with HR and another coworker. Apparently my comment about using a service dog vest was offensive and I’m no longer able to bring my dog to work.

I eat meat (only organic) and am a pretty good cook so I told them that their fake meat is probably super processed and filled with preservatives and chemicals. It’s also packaged in a bunch of plastic so it’s probably not any better for the environment than eating meat. They were also talking about how eating pre-packaged frozen food was on the same skill level as making home cooked meals with fresh ingredients, so I told them this wasn’t true and that they actually can’t cook.

Her boobs were hanging out and she was wearing a halter top. To me, it looked like she was dressed like a ho. Let me point out that this girl is not a ho and her personality is one of a pretty wholesome girl, which is why this came as such a shock to me.

Long story short: I told her outright at the climax ""I definitely don't think you're a ho, but you're dressed like one."" She then said that it's how she dressed and I told her she should change that. She said that people dress like that and it's fine. To win the argument, I brought up how she's constantly talking about how she went to this horrible high school and a majority of girls and guys there are pretty bad. I basically said that she should take that into consideration when she thinks about where her way of dressing may come from

AITA for yelling at my little brother because he kept using my full name?,"     Hiya Reddit! Sorry if my formatting is a little weird, I'm on Mobile. 

    I've lived with my dad and stepmom for around 5 years and October 28th I realized that I'm MtF transgender. I've always hated my full name but from then on I've only hated it more. Only my mom knows that I'm transgender so far. This happened around that time, so a complete transcription of dialogue won't be shared.

     My little brother was around 3 at the time and I was 15. I had been trying to get him to call me by a gender neutral nickname before I came out as trans, since I was already used to being called it. He wouldn't stop using my full name. I understand he's 3 but I believe he should still be taught to call me by my nickname instead.

     The reason I have for posting this happened after months of asking him to change and trying to teach him to not use my full name. Eventually one day we were all sitting down eating dinner and he used my full name. By this point I had asked him a handful of times to stop and instead use the nickname, so I yelled at him. I understand that I shouldn't have yelled at him since he was a toddler, but at this point I was fed up because he used to use my nickname all the time. 

     My dad told me it's not a big deal since ""it's my name"" and he should keep using it before my stepmom told me I'm in the wrong and he should keep using it because she ""doesn't do nicknames."" 

     I told the situation to my mom and grandma (grandma on my mom's side) and they were both on my side about it. I understand that I shouldn't have yelled at a 3 year old since he doesn't really know much better, but was me not wanting to be called my full name really a big deal? AITA?",Asshole

She went ""shopping"" a lot. I was watching over her shoulder one day and I saw that my brother's name popped up on her screen. My stomach started to churn. I've been cheated on before, I know the warning signs. There is \*absolutely no reason she needs to be talking to my brother\*. If she needs to talk to him, she can talk to him through me. That's what I thought at the time anyways. I tried to go through her phone, but I didn't know the password and I didn't want to disable it because then she would have known that I was on to her. 

I tried to catch her in her lies, she wouldn't give me straight answers about where she was going, and I had enough. I confronted her yesterday. I waited for her to be done with classes, and I told her that she needed to come over immediately. I told her I knew about her and my brother. Immediately she looked guilty. I'll admit, I was pissed, and lost control. I started yelling at her, I did call her a slut for messing around with my brother, and I told her that we were done. Then she started to cry, asking me what I was talking about. I told her that I saw my brothers name on her phone. She took her phone out, unlocked it, pulled up her texts between her and my brother. They were planning a surprise party for me at my grandparent's house, this Saturday night. I got even angrier because that didn't make sense to me. How could a surprise birthday party be more important that me? What I mean is, why did she go to such an extent and make me think she was cheating on me? Of course I would think she was cheating on me. If some guy saw his girlfriend texting his brother behind his back and not telling him where she was going, I think that any rational man would think that she was fooling around. And the texts also don't explain why she couldn't just tell me where she was really going. 

So yeah, party's off. Everyone thinks I'm an asshole. My brother's mad that I didn't try to talk to him. I don't see why I should, its my girlfriend that was texting him. I just don't see it. I think I had every reason to think she was cheating on me, that's not my fault. I'm allowed to be angry, especially since I've been cheated on before. But she doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and wont answer my texts. Bullet dodged, I guess? So reddit, am I really the asshole here?",Asshole
AITA for not taking a dinner party seriously because the menu was vegan?,"My friend’s wife is a vegan, he is not. They recently moved to their own place, and they wanted to have a dinner with us to have us over to see their new place. The wife is okay with her husband eating meat occasionally, though because she’s responsible for most of the cooking, he usually is meat free or vegan. But if he’s unwell or not cooking because he’s busy, she cooks meat for him if he wants it. So she’s clearly okay cooking meat and eggs and dairy sometimes for special occasions.

When we went to the dinner, the menu was all vegan. She’d made stir fried vegetables, a lentil pie and a rice and bean salad. I was taken aback to say the least, because they clearly know that I’m a big meat eater, and she does cook other things given the necessity.

Long story short, after the dinner I went around telling people how the dinner wasn’t really a dinner because it was all vegan food. Word got around to them, and now the wife is really upset, because she feels like she did her best and made a lot of food, and put effort into it. My friend is pissed at me over this. I just don’t want to apologize because I don’t think I’m in the wrong. I ate the dinner and was done. I’m allowed to have opinions of it. And she should cater to people she’s inviting so I don’t think she was a good dinner host myself. While everyone else thinks I’m a major asshole because I disrespected a vegan dinner or something. 

So just asking for an unbiased neutral perspective. Am I the asshole here?",Asshole
AITA for getting upset with my best friend for not getting me a gift for my birthday?,"So my birthday happened recently and I normally post my wishlist 5 months before my birthday because 1) my friends and family say i never know what I want and 2) when I do tell them what i want they complain that its too expensive for them on such short notice. Now my friends/family know that they can tell me anytime if they cannot afford a gift for me because im very considerate. I'd usually just tell them they can send a small card with a personal message that I can remember them by. This friend told me I'll have to get my gift a week after my birthday because they didn't know what to get me and they're low on cash. I said that's fine though i thought it was fishy that my ""best friend"" didn't know what to get me after knowing me for so many years as well as the fact that i posted my wishlist once a month every month for 5 months. I let it go after that though. Well the date came and I get greeted with another excuse that something came up. I said forget it just get me a keepsake because I was pissed now because im thinking you had 5 months to save. Out of the wealthy amount of time we've been friends this person only ever got me one gift while every year i make an effort to get my friend a gift. Even if it wasnt they're birthday. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. If I am Im open to constructive criticism. AITA? Btw Im leaving my information vague because I think they use reddit as well.

Edit: let me shine some light on this situation. I was asked to post the wishlist because my friends wanted to give me a gift. This only started because they wanted it. I only did it 5 months in advance to give them time to save. Second, yes they all do this as well i have a friend already making their list and their birthday is in September. And third I've spent massive amounts of money on my friend to give them nice things. Sometimes they asked for it and sometimes they didn't. I've spent close to $1000 on that same friend. $500 of which they promised to give back but never did. Then they suddenly post a pic with a new outfit or item they got or out in luxurious places.

AITA for calling out a friend on their fake sexuality?,"This happened when I was 12, aka an edgy seventh grader.

At the time I knew this friend, let’s call her F. She and I got along pretty well, and I considered her to be close. The only problem was, at the time F was very caught up in the toxic side of tumblr, aka the extremely left side.

Now, just as a disclaimer I in no way have any issues with the LGBTQ community. I myself am bi and I currently have my own girlfriend (I’m a girl.) Love is love, etc etc.

F soon began to parade around these ideas that all men are evil, that there are infinite genders, that everyone is fat-phobic etc etc. You know, she was just THAT person. And pretty soon she clutched onto this idea that she herself was asexual.

I have absolutely no problem with people who are asexual, once again. Only F... well, at the young age that she was (12-13), there really was no way to tell that she was indeed asexual. There are LOTS of kids at that age that haven’t started liking other people yet, but that doesn’t exactly mean they’re asexual. It’s really hard to tell until you’re at least 15-16, in my opinion.

So F begins to brag about it, telling new people that she was asexual in an almost proud way, like it was an accomplishment. So, one day while she was loudly boasting about it I snapped at her. I forget exactly what I had said, but it was something along the lines of “do you really think lying to people like that will get you attention?” And “you’re really too young to know for sure”

F looked super angry and pretty much gave me silent treatment for the rest of the year. That didn’t bother me much, but a few people overheard and they were FURIOUS. They told me off for calling her out like that, and painted me to be evil for the rest of the year. I’m in high school now and I still think about the incident.

So, am I the asshole or is everyone else overreacting?",Asshole

AITA for costing an employee a loan?,"So I do payroll for a company with about 500 employees and a couple times a week I’ll get an email from a bank asking for a wage verification so the employee can get approved for a loan.  I always do these on Fridays because that’s my least busy day, and the banks that regularly send these verifications know that and expect it sometime Friday afternoon. 

On Monday a woman at the bank sent a verification form for an employee (George) and I sent I my usual reply that she’ll get it Friday and she replied back thanks...I thought that would be it.  On Tuesday I get a voicemail (I don’t answer my phone Monday/Tuesday since I’m busy) from George’s supervisor asking if I can do it by then end of Wednesday because otherwise he might not get the loan.  I ignore it because I have a bunch of other things that are more important and time sensitive than one employees loan. 

On Thursday afternoon around 430 (Im scheduled til 4 but I usually leave around 5) I get a call from the supervisor asking why I didn’t fill out the form and that George isn’t going to get the loan unless I fill out the paperwork by the end of the day.  He tries to make me feel bad about it (I don’t), and I tell him that whether or not George gets the loan isn’t my problem and that I’m not staying later to do work that has no effect on me.  I do all verification forms on Friday because it’s one of the least important things I have to do.  If he wanted the loan that badly he should’ve applied earlier.  The supervisor is pissed but there’s really nothing anyone can do because I’m literally the only one in the company other than the owner of the company that knows how to do payroll.

AITA for complaining that my friend only has tap water at home when he invites us ?,"Hey, so around every 3 months or so, we reunite with my group of friends at a friend's house, when everyone is back and available. The four or five of us like to eat outside then come back and play some games. 

Later during the night I feel thirsty, and each time my friend says if i'm thirsty i have to get some bottle and fill it with tap water. One time, two times, three times, no problem. But the last time, I complained that there is never some bottled water to drink for us all. He starts saying that if I have luxury tastes and I want to drink bottled water, I have to ""buy it before coming, this isn't a charity organization"".

We then argue about is it polite to send your guests get water from the faucet or should we have bottled water available for them. And apparently I'm wrong and it is normal not to have any.

AITA for correcting my parents when using the wromg gender pronouns?,"Backstory (and obligatory ~I'm on mobile~): I came out as a gay male 3 years ago to my family and 6 years ago to ex-friends. 

When I first came out to my mom and dad, I knew I made a mistake. All my life I'd been afraid of speaking out against them and I just had a feeling this wasn't going to go well. 

The table went silent. No one said a word. I started to get nervous, all the confidence I'd built up slowly draining away. 

Then, my mom spoke up: ""Well, can't we just call you *wrong name* and they/them? It's easier for us.""

My heart broke knowing that they weren't going to put in the effort to even try, but I reluctantly agreed since anything is better than my dead name (Birth name) and she/her. 

Fast forward to today. I've asked them on multiple occasions to use he/him pronouns for me, yet every time I do, they either ignore me or make some excuse as to why they can't.

AITA for not sitting down at a concert,"I was attending a concert a few months ago in a very popular tiered outdoor amphitheater with 3 friends. The kind of venue where every seat has a decent view of the stage. The artist was a very popular family friendly musician playing with an orchestra. The entire venue was standing as the orchestra played for 20 minutes and then for another half hour or so while we waited for the headliner to come out. As soon as the band came out (minus the singer) everyone in the crowd cheered and then all began to sit down. The four of us remain standing for two reasons. One was because the singer hadn't even come out on stage yet, and the other was because we had four people and only three reserved seats in that area.

Admittedly, we were hoping that everyone would stand through the show so that we didn't have to worry about squeezing four people into three seats. But before the singer ever even came out on stage, the people in the row behind us started yelling at us to sit down. It started off at a normal volume and quickly evolved into straight up screaming. One guy even came down and screamed in our ears to sit down. It actually hurt my eardrum when he did. I would like to again point out that the singer wasn't even on the stage yet at this point. But looking around we were the only people we could see still standing. Someone a few rows in front of us heard the people yelling, and then stood up to show some solidarity. He kept looking up and smiling at us so I know that was the reason. He sat down again after a few minutes. 

Eventually the singer comes out on stage and the entire crowd once again stands up to applaud. Then every person in the venue appears to sit down, so we decided to as well. My friend's wife sat on his lap. After a few minutes security came over saying that we were being disruptive and were smoking. Two of us had using vapes long before any of this happened, but they said we were smoking to get security over there. My friend's wife got up and walked around and then came back and sat on his lap again for the rest of the show. There were no further incidents from security or the people behind us. 

At the end of the show when everyone was leaving a guy jumped up onto and stood on a 6ft ledge. As we walked by we heard him say ""Wow, I'm surprised that nobody is yelling at me to sit down!"" Which we all thought was pretty funny and definitely felt like we were in the right. We had no intention of being the only people standing, but we probably would have sat down a lot quicker if people weren't yelling at the top of their lungs at us. I have been to hundreds of concerts in my life and I have never experienced anything like this, yet deep down I still feel like maybe I was the asshole. So WITA?

I told her if she didn’t come get him I wouldn’t keep him, and she ignored me so I gave him to my sister.

She called me later and said she would be coming to get her things, and Kirito the cat. I told her I gave the cat to my sister and if she wanted him, she would have to deal with that between my sister and her.

AITA for how I handled this situation with my daughter in law?,"Just for context, I share a house with my husband, son, and his wife and kids. This was a situation we entered out of financial necessity. I know my DIL was not a fan of the arrangement but there really was no choice. 

This resentment she has about the living situation may contribute to her behavior, but I'm not sure.  She has always been a quiet and reserved person who stayed mostly to her part of the house and only came upstairs to use the shared kitchen. I want to see my grandchildren, so I will often come down to visit with them or to do laundry. Even when I come down, she seems disinterested in talking to me and sort of hides away until I leave. 

Anyway, I had been noticing more and more that there will be laundry still in the dryer when I come down to do laundry, or she will have baskets of laundry on the counter or floor. The basket is never empty. I have never gone in there and seen everything washed, dried,and put away. I also noticed that she would leave heavily soiled dishes to soak and ""forget"" to come back to them until the next morning or she would run the dishwasher and not unload it in a timely fashion. 

I got fed up today and I put the dirty dishes in a bucket and the clean ones that were in the dishwasher in a box. I also pulled their laundry out of the dryer and put it in a basket so I could do mine, although it was still wet. I had just had it. 

When my son came home, he noticed these things and lit into me, calling me passive aggressive and giving me a sob story about how his wife has had a kidney infection and between her health and their two young kids, she has had trouble keeping up with house work. I told him that his wife is essentially a lazy 16 year old who can't handle any responsibilities.

She also told me that she prefers her own space while sleeping and would want to cuddle a little before bedtime, but not while being asleep. 

This is silly to me. My mom was kind enough to let us have her house and left us food, this is a special weekend. If I do end up pulling the blanket off her mid-sleep, she could just wake me up to take some of it back and I wouldn’t care. Hell, I’d encourage her to.

AITA for not wanting my sister to borrow my dress?,"*throwaway bc she sometimes uses reddit*

A little background: we are four sisters with one younger brother. I (21f) am the second-oldest, I am very close to my older sister M(22) and less close to the next sister F(19). Our youngest sister P is 18.

When we were kids, she was a real tomboy. She didn’t play with us, only with my brother J(17) and she hated “girly” things. We used to tease her by holding her down and forcibly putting make-up on her, lol, and it took 3 of us to hold her! she was a wildcat. But last year she got her braces off (really bad teeth) and finished high school and suddenly she’s all acting like a beauty queen. She wears dresses sometimes now and even bought a pair of high heels which are ridiculous, she’s never worn them before, and they make her tower over all of us. She acts like she doesn’t even notice that all the guys are staring at her, she’s super-friendly with them and talks about sport and computers and cars, you know, the whole “I’m not like other girls” thing.

You have to understand how super annoying she is. She was never popular at school, just lived in her own world and read all the time and because of that she always pronounces words wrong, like she’s only read them not heard them. I try to correct her so she won’t embarrass herself in public but she just grins like it’s funny.

Now my sister M is having a big party before she goes away overseas to study in Siena, and everyone is invited. It’s at a big hall and is catered. P asked if she could wear a dress of mine which I’d been meaning to take up bc it’s too long for me but fits her bc she’s a scarecrow. I said yes but now I don’t want to. I want to wear that dress myself one day and I frankly don’t want it to be seen as her dress. Bc there were 4 girls, all mine and M’s clothes got passed down to her and F when we were growing up, so she’s always worn my clothes and I’m kind of over it.

She hasn’t got any money, our parents give her an allowance but it’s not much tbf and has to pay for a lot of things. The rest of us get more bc we’re in college. She wanted to work as a life saver at the pool over summer but our Gramma came to stay after her operation and Mom needed P to help her at home with Gramma who is a bit of a handful. Also Mom said she would just swan around showing herself off and should be home helping out instead.

She still had the allowance though, she could have saved it and bought her own dress for M’s party. So I just told her I was wearing it, though I’ve actually bought another one, and J, our little brother, overheard me talking about it with M and now he says I’m an asshole and that he’ll tell her if I don’t.

I don’t think I am. It’s my dress. I don’t want her ruining it. And my sisters don’t think I should let her wear it either. It’s only J who thinks that.

So am I being an asshole or should she get her own damn clothes and stop trying to take everything from us?

EDIT: Wow, people are saying some really harsh things. It's gone beyond just the dress thing.  
I don't think I've explained it all very well, it's hard to. Growing up, Paulie was always in trouble. I've been trying to think of what she did so I could explain but I can't really think of any good examples... it was more her attitude. She was always being punished and I guess I've gotten used to everything being her fault. Maybe I'm not being entirely fair. She has a right to grow up. But we've got a family dynamic that works, she's the only person it doesn't work for, and what are we supposed to do, change the whole family to suit her?  
It's just that, it sounds like one thing when I'm talking to Marcy about it, she and I understand what a pain P is. But now putting it before other people without M here, it's like, everyone's sticking up for Paulie. I'm not used to that. I really don't know whether I just haven't explained it properly or whether I should have another think about who she is.",Asshole

AITA for hanging up on 911 operator and saying an accident would be his fault?,"
I was driving to work and there was this guys swerving all over the place

Called 911 and told them I thought there was a drunk driver. The operator asked how I knew he was drunk. Did I see him drink something. Was I sure it was alcohol he was drinking. And a few other questions I don’t remember.

I ended up admitting I didn’t know he was drunk, but he was driving really erratically and it was dangerous. Like the guy was swerving all over the place. Sometimes a little into the other side of the street. It doesn’t take an genius to know something was wrong.

The operator then asked “Did he hit anything?” in this very dismissive tone like I was just exaggerating. I told her he hadn’t hit anything but the curb yet, but probably was going to.

The 911 operator then said she would connect me to the police and I could tell them about it.

So I say something like “No, you won’t. I’m turning. I’ve got to get to work now. He’s driving north down Orange st. He just passed Yellow st. He’s driving a white truck and if he fucking hits someone it’s on you for wasting time”. Then I hung up.

So I was talking to a coworker about it and he says she was probably just following protocol and I was being a dick about. Also says that I should have continued following the guy to help the police find him because someone really could have gotten hurt. Which is probably what I should have done because a person possible getting hit by a car is more important than being late to work. After the whole exchange though I was just so pissed off.

Edit. I get it I’m an asshole. Still stand by she was a total bitch though, but that doesn’t excuse my behavior.

Tomorrow when I’m not so fucking pissed I’ll probably change my tune and realize she was just doing her job, but for now, for today she’s a total fucking bitch. Who the fuck sighs during a 911 call. What an ass.

WIBTA if I asked some of my employees to help out this weekend with no pay?,"I own a furniture store and have a small crew of salespeople, delivery and installers. We've been very busy and a lot of things have fallen through the cracks. If we had one 8 hour day devoted to cleaning the warehouse and organizing files, then we would be on top of things. Everyone says they have no time during the week and I can't afford to pay a bunch of people overtime. I just gave them year end bonuses and was more than generous.

I want to ask my staff to come in Monday (we are closed) and work a normal day but it has to be off the books, i.e. no pay. I will order lunch and people can come in shorts and shirts. I don't care. If this doesn't get straighten out then we will start to lose business and money and (hopefully not) jobs. I pay them good wages and they just got bonuses so I don't think I am asking much.",Asshole

AITA for telling an old man that he's going to die soon?,"Pretty TA sounding title, but hear me out before passing judgement.

A couple years ago my mother bought an extremely expensive television. She pretty much exclusively uses it to watch old TV shows and movies from her childhood - stuff that does not need to be watched on a 4K TV. She basically wouldn't even notice a difference watching on a much less expensive TV, she just bought the priciest thing assuming it would look better.

I recently was able to convince her that she doesn't need the TV, and she initially agreed to give it to me because I watch a lot of movies and having a 4K TV would greatly benefit my viewing experience. My 87 year old grandfather had just broken his old TV - so my mother decided to give him the TV. I genuinely couldn't believe this, as he probably wouldn't care if he was watching on some shitty computer monitor, and it seemed like such a waste of money to me. I offered to give my grandpa my old TV, but he wanted the expensive one because it's much larger. I felt angry and betrayed because my mother gave my grandpa a TV that was supposed to be mine, and we all ended up getting into an argument about it. My grandpa was being very stubborn and refusing to listen, and I ended up telling him that he isn't going to be alive for much longer, and I would get much more value out of the TV than he would. I also pointed out that his vision is really subpar and he probably wouldn't even notice the difference in quality from a cheaper TV. My grandpa became very offended at me pointing out his age and probability of death, and he's now not speaking to me. My mother has not changed her plan of giving him the TV. I understand that what I said may be objectionable taken out of context, but I think he should have understood that I was led to believe the TV was mine, and of course I was angry and in the heat of an argument when I said it. Also, it's not inaccurate what I said, he is very old and I imagine I would get MUCH more value out of the television.

**TL;DR: Got into an argument with grandfather over him taking a TV that was supposed to be mine, accurately pointed out that he doesn't have long to live, therefore I would get much more value out of the TV. Family is angry with me now.**",Asshole
AITA for not being able to help with a tarot clients mental health and housing?,"
I practice Tarot, I decided that I would practice on some people to test and improve. I took a lady’s request, she clearly had some issues at home, some other issues. Before every reading I make sure that the client knows that I can not ‘fix their problems’ but I am just advsing based on the cards. She agreed. Throughout the reading she mentioned that her mum is toxic towards her, family situation isn’t good, neither is her financial (she still lives at home) so the reading finished, I’ll admit I was a little uncomfortable knowing all these details about her life but I went on and forgot about it. 

Tonight she messaged me asking for ‘help’ I thought she meant she wanted me to clarify something in my reading. she asked for another reading. I said I can’t do that, I don’t have my stuff with me. She said ‘someone said they would help me get away from my family and then changed their mind and I’m pissed and my family wants me gone’ so I spoke to her get her to calm down. she was quite distraught through the messages, so I asked a friend of mine, who is a crisis line worker, if I could send her through to talk to him. So I told her I had someone she could talk to. She continued responding aggressively ‘will he give me a reading?’ ‘How can HE help me?’ ‘I want a reading’. I once again mentioned to her that Tarot cant fix life problems but instead give guidances. Again she said ‘unless he can get me out of here then I don’t wanna hear it’ and ‘I DONT NEED ANYONE TO LISTEN IF THIS GUY ISNT GONNA LET ME STAY WITH HIM IM WASTING MY TIME’ 

I could see she’s  distraught, I try to rationalise so that I don’t panic, I ask her where she’s from, she said she’s from place XX, I said well me and this guy live in YY, which is across the world so we can’t help you with your living so I’m not sure why you’re telling me about it. 

She continued to get mad about this person who gave her ‘false hope’ and I said well maybe she can’t support you right now. I mentioned that because she’s gone there’s no point in continuing on about it, but that she could still find someone who lives near to help. I said once again that if she wants to talk to someone, the friend of mine will listen. I said yes he can’t give you a place to stay but he’s a good listener and comfort can give you the support you need. Once again, she swears at me saying ‘I need a fuckin place to stay’ and I said, well I can’t help you with that. I say again that she can message him and she says ‘you wouldn’t give me a reading so no.”  I say ‘I don’t have my stuff, please stop guilting me, I’m a 16 year old who gave you a free reading to improve my skills, not a life guru. I offered help, only you can choose to accept that. I’ll listen if you need to vent but I physically can’t help you with your housing situation’  then she said I was accusing her of shit and that she was done with me and then blocked me.

AITA for going off on this guy for not telling me I was sitting next to his sick kid for half an hour,"&#x200B;

Soo I'm sitting at Walgreens by the pharmacy waiting for a prescription, this guy and his 7-8 year old kid sit down in the chairs right next to me. I'm sitting there for at least half an hour when the guy out of nowhere goes ""Is the medicine almost ready? I've been sitting here 30 minutes waiting to be helped, my kid is sick here, he has the flu""... the flu???? I immediately perk up out of my daydream and I'm like ""the flu??? you mean I've been sitting next to your sick kid this whole time???"" The guy looks at me like I'm an alien... I mean for the most part I'm sympathetic but I say to him ""c'mon guy you couldn't have given me a heads up"" and just completely ignores me like ""whatever dude""... him esstentially ignoring me really activated me and I really start telling him off for having no common courtesy... the guy just scoops his kid and walks out leaving his fluey germs in his wake

AITA For berating a mother on the bus for not controlling her sick kid?,"I was on the bus this morning, it wasn't packed and there were a few empty seats next to each other, but this mother with her very obviously-sick son (looked to be about 4 or 5 years old) boarded and chose an empty seat next to me.

The son sat right next to me while the mother sat next to him with another empty seat beside her. This irked me immediately because now she is exposing him to me when she didn't have too. Shortly thereafter, the bus got more packed and finding an empty seat was harder.

I put up with it for a few stops, but the kid keeps coughing and sneezing in my direction. He keeps complaining to his mom that he feels really hot, etc.

I told the mother ""can you control this fucking brat? He keeps coughing in all directions."" 

She goes into her spiel, ""wow that's incredibly rude"" 

I told her it was rude to sit next to me when there were other empty seats before, knowing the kid was sick. She eventually told me ""if you don't like it, just stand somewhere else.""

I got up and called her a rotten bitch and stood near the front of the bus. Some of the people on the bus were watching/most were ignoring everything unfolding.

AITA? I get that the kid was sick and couldn't do anything about it, but the mother should have told him to cough/sneeze into his hands.",Asshole
AITA? For asking this guy if the girl he was with was his girlfriend because he asked for my number and such not even a few minutes earlier,"I was going to work and this guy was sitting next to me on the bus. When i got off he also got off at the same stop. I didnt care much until he started to try and get my attention. He asked where i was from and where i was going. I said to work and that i have to go now its starting to rain. He pulled out his phone and started to tug on my jacket asking for my number. I pulled away and pointed to my work saying that if you really want to talk to me you can get a drink at my work, but that i have a boyfriend so im not looking for that. He replied he didnt care about my bf that i was really pretty and i just ignored him and ran to work. 

I got to work clocked in and maybe 10 minutes later the power for our plaza goes out. Theres a few other stores at our plaza mostly fast food and a clothing store. 2 people walk in and its the guy from earlier with now another girl. I thought about it yea i just started this job 2 days prior  and yea these are potential customers and i could be losing a sale but something just lit up inside me not being jelly but just fear of what this guy might do to this girl if i have to serve them booze. So before i could even get them a table i blurted out is this your girlfriend to him.  He looked puzzled and responded no why do you ask. I replied but to her he just tryied to pick me up earlier sorry is why i was asking.  My manager over hears everything and yells at me while quickly apologizing to the man. While they are talking the girl walks a bit closer to me and says actually i jut met him out side ive never seen him before so thank you for letting me know. After my manager gives me an evil glare and sits them at a table the power comes back on. They stand up and say thank you and walk out the girl comes up to me says they have her clothes in the other store since they were shopping so she wants to go pay for it. I guess he offered to buy her stuff.  

So i guess my manager  told the owner and so i had both of them telling me how it was bad and i shouldnt of done it because of the money and sale i lost and that im salty blablabla.

I only did it because management is shit right now the heh ask me to stay after 12 till 5am and they will drive me home and they were to dru k to do it. So when it comes to my saftey and the saftey of my servers customers is mostly why i said something. We have alot of girl's and people go missing here and they rarley get found alive. I didnt want it to be like oh we found this chick dead and you serverd them alchohol  last. I didnt want to get sued or what ever happens and i dont want my employees all female's to worry about going or coming to work.



So yea are my bosses right am i the asshole?


Edit: so the same guy showed up at my work today and sat down for a beer. After i got his drink he started  telling me that the girl left him soon after and that its all my fault . That i was very rude for me to do that and why did i do it. I told him im very sorry qnd it will never happen again even offered to grab his drink for him free of charge. He said it was fine that he just wanted to know why i did. It that im a very pretty lady and shouldnt be doing this. Not that it matters but we are both black me island him Nigerian. I again apologized multiple times and went back to my work serving other people. He didnt order much else but asked for my number twice before he left. 

Yeayea i can see im the ass but like from a girls point of view he was just to aggresive that day for it to be normal. Or i probably wouldn't of cared",Asshole
WIBTA for raising my child in an artificial language?,"So, for a bit of backstory: Me [M22] and my best friend [M23] created a language of our own back in school and have been using it ever since. We're both fluent in it and we often use it to talk when we don't want others to understand.
My friend and I were thinking about raising our future children in our language. The mothers of the children would of course speak to the children in English, so the children would be bilingual.

(Quick side note: Artificial doesn't mean it's limited or anything, you can express anything you like in the language).

AITA For Not Believing In The Wage Gap in My Work Place?,"I'm M23 and work in tech sales, I work with a team of 5 other people 2 other guys and 3 young women. We all got hired about 1 year ago and our numbers are always gauged against each other. I'm consistently the top performer, because I just put a savage amount of hours in and have no work life balance. The rest of the guys vary in the listing but are usually in the top 3 with one or two girls sometimes in the mix at the end of each month. Now since I'm the top performer and a large part of our compensation is based on commission I have been making more than all of them every month and most months the guys make more than the girls in commish. We recently had a meeting with our sales manager and the young women chimed in that theres a gender wage gap in our team/office because the men are always making more and sometimes a lot more. He tried to explain that it was because of commission and that we're all on the same base salary, which they know. But they were kinda ranting about how they should be given a larger % of the commissions they make so that when they do make a ""sale"" it would more or equal us and that would be fair as it would lessen the wage gap. Our sales manager let out a huge sigh and excused himself from the room. A few seconds of awkwardness ensued and I faked like I had a call coming through and got the fuck out of there since it was a friday and I just ran out of the building and ran home. 

 I met up with a friend for dinner later on friday and told her about this scenario telling her how it was crazy to me because there is no wage gap, I just make more ""sales"" so I make more money thats how it works. She said that I'm an ass for not listening to their concerns and to her (She has her masters in HR) it does sound like a gender pay gap and the young womens compromise seemed fair. I just laughed and she called me an ass again.....

AITA for joking that it would be healthier for my brother’s small-chested overweight fiancée to just lose weight instead of getting a boob job after she said she wanted a boob job to be proportional?,"I (23M) was hanging out with my brother (26M) and his fiancée (26F) at their house. When I came out of their bathroom ready to leave for the night, I saw them playing rock paper scissors (RPS). I asked them what they were playing for. There was a brief pause before she said they play RPS once a day and if she beats him seven times in a row, he would pay for her boob job. She said she has gotten to five a few times. I tease her about her weight sometimes. She’s 5’4” and 160 lbs according to my brother. She never seems offended. Neither does my brother. It’s probably because we’re all Asian and fat people are playfully shamed constantly amongst family and friends. Plus, no one in my family is overweight. I never made fun of her small boobs before because no one really jokes about that in our culture. Furthermore, my girlfriend (24F) got a boob job herself. 


After she told me what they play RPS for, I asked her why she wanted a boob job. I was confused because my brother has always told me that he preferred small, natural boobs. She said she feels disproportionate having small boobs on her frame. I joked that it would be healthier to just lose weight so her small boobs would be proportional to her thinner frame. She has been going to the gym with my brother but he says she eats too many sweets. I must have made my first sensitive joke to her, because she then said it must be nice to have a skinny girlfriend with fake boobs who’s also an Ivy League graduate and an Instagram model. She then apologized to my brother for not being perfect like my girlfriend. I have heard her talk about my girlfriend’s skinniness multiple times before, but she has never talked about my girlfriend’s boobs to me. She’s not wrong about my girlfriend’s skinniness. She is 5’7” and 110 lbs. Most importantly, I have never heard her talk in that snide tone before. 


I told her that I was just making a joke and wasn’t trying to compare her with my girlfriend. My brother said he likes his fiancée’s body the way it is, and if he really wanted her to have fake boobs, he would have bought them for her already and not make her beat him at a low probability game. He also said he wouldn’t have put a ring on her finger if he didn’t absolutely love everything about her. She then said my girlfriend is a keeper and I needed to do everything I could to keep her forever. Again, I have never heard her talk in this catty tone before. My brother told her that was enough. He said she probably had too much to drink and I should probably go. I apologized to them for ending the night on a bad tone and he said I didn’t do anything wrong and walked me down. She didn’t say anything. I don’t think she was drunk either. She has the best alcohol tolerance out of all of us and only drank about as much as we did.",Asshole
AITA for revoking an invite because the guy is too old?,"So I invited a couple of my coworkers I frequently went out with to go out for my birthday this weekend, we are mostly around our early twenties (me turning 19 being the exception). There was, however, another coworker present who were generally friendly with. He’s in his mid to late 40s, so I didn’t think to invite him because I didn’t even think he’d be interested. 
So go forward a few hours and they come back, one of the coworkers asking if he could join. Now I know I shouldn’t have made the invite in front of him, in hindsight, but I said ‘I guess’ hesitantly. The thing is he’s a nice person I don’t have any problems, but frankly I just didn’t want him to come. I don’t know him that well and to be honest it’s my birthday weekend, it was really rude for them to invite him on the spot in front of me.

AITA for kicking my little brother's girlfriend out?,"So I (25f) came home for a couple weeks. Last night my parents were out so it was just me and my 18y/o brother at home. Without telling me my brother invited a girl over which I was kinda uncomfortable with him doing. He told me it was his girlfriend and that they had been dating for almost a year and that our parents knew about her coming round. I don't get to come home that often so I didn't even know he had a girlfriend so was quite skeptical of this and told her she had to leave. My parents wouldn't be checking their phones because of where they were so I couldn't ask them. My brother and his girlfriend made a huge fuss over this saying I had no right to tell her she couldn't be there, but I stood my ground and eventually they ran upstairs and locked themselves in his room. I sat at the door to make sure nothing would happen and she eventually got annoyed and left. My brother is calling me an asshole for this and says he is too old to be treated like that, especially by his sister. He is barely 18 and shouldn't be acting like that so I think I did the right thing. I spoke to my parents this morning and they told me that it is his girlfriend and that she can come over no problem, even though he didn't specifically ask them if she could this time and they were annoyed at ME instead of him.

"AITA for not wanting to pay thousands of dollars for something my disabled child broke, especially after the owner called him a retard?","Recently I've been threatened with the police and possibly a court order from the other party involved over this and I really don't think it'll turn out in their favor, but it wouldn't hurt to ask.

Recently I was at a baby shower for my niece and brought along my son. We live in a state where the virus hasn't hit very hard so we figured we could go. But it isn't about that.

My son was born with Downs syndrome and his is pretty severe, there have been so many hurdles in his development and so many accommodations I've had to beg for, so I already have to deal with a lot trying to tend to his needs and that really takes time and money, so I can't afford to pay $1800 for something he broke because he didn't know any better. He might be 14 but his mental capacity hasn't caught up, he just thought he had a toy and didn't think of its price or build quality, which is no fault of mine, if anything something fragile like that shouldn't have been left out in a place where there were also going to be children with the same behaviors.

Anyways my nephew (brother of my niece) was taking notes for college on his iPad (which I had no idea he had spent over a grand for, electronics are so expensive nowadays!), But he had to leave to set something up so he left it on his seat. My son had taken an interest in the thing so he picked it up and started tapping the screen, I told him to put it down but he wouldn't listen and I figured he couldn't do any harm to the thing since it was in a case, so I let him be.

He starts drawing lines on the screen at first, which I wasn't opposed to.

But then he started jabbing the screen with the pen and a split second later I heard a crack, he had drove the pen into the screen causing it to go haywire. To say I was shocked would be an understatement.

I tried to hide it before the owner came back but he caught me in the act and stood in shock for a moment before yelling at me and about how I should keep my son's ""retard hands"" (VERY offensive) off of his stuff, which made both of us very upset with him. I began to yell back at how my son needs to be forgiven because he didn't know what he was doing, and I've had to provide so much for him so my nephew had no right to call my son what he did, and in fact it was his fault that he left such a thing out in the open, but he didn't want to hear it and said he will be expecting reimbursement for damaged property or else he would ""let me have it"". I told him good luck with that and packed up my stuff and left because I wasn't having it. I hope our family alienates him for calling my son such a despicable thing.

He wants me to pay him nearly $1800. Which I will resist because of the way he acted towards my son.",Asshole

AITA for Calling My Little Sister an Entitled Twat After She Suggested She Should Get Extra Votes When She Lost a Family Vote?,"This story really isn't complicated. My family and I have a rule of every big decision goes to a family vote between the five of us, and the majority gets their way. Even though my twin brother and I have moved out, we still get a vote on things that concern us, like family vacation. 

&#x200B;

Normally, what we do is vote on a location, then we'll figure out how long we can go. We usually try for six days, that way, everyone gets to pick something major for one day, then we can all vote on something for the last.

&#x200B;

My sister was particularly miserable this year. We went to NYC for WrestleMania. Family vote was for WrestleMania. My choice was Raw. My twin brother chose Smackdown. Mom chose NXT, and Dad chose the Hall of Fame. Sis chose to go to the Met and was disappointed. She wanted to go to a Broadway show ""because the museum sucked,"" and we voted no because *damn, those are expensive!*

&#x200B;

Well, a few days ago, she brought up the idea that the loser should get extra votes the next time around. Uh-huh. No way. That's not how voting works. We don't say, ""Well, Senator Whatsherface lost the last three votes, so she gets four this time,"" or ""Representative Whathisface is feeling left out, so he gets two votes."" That's not how voting. She's 17. It's time to stop the coddling. And I said as much.

&#x200B;

She got upset and pointed out how even though my brother and I don't live at home anymore, we still get equal say, and that it's not fair. She threw up the basement gym and how a home theatre ""would've been shared more."" No, it wouldn't've. We have five TVs in that house, and we still fight over the big screen in the living room. Besides, as my brother pointed out, he and I paid half, and Mom and Dad paid half for the remodel, so if anyone shouldn't have gotten a say, it's the person not contributing to the bill.

&#x200B;

She went on and on. She wanted a little lap dog. We got a Doberman. Well, first of all, any dog is a lap dog if you try hard enough. Second of all, the local ASPCA had just shut down a breeding kennel, so we rescued him instead of paying $600 for one. Third of all, we're not the sort of people a little frou frou dog needs. The need somebody who take them to the groomer and put bows in their hair, not somebody who is going to look a mud puddle and think ""I bet I can get a big splash out of that."" It ain't fair to the dog.

&#x200B;

We don't watch TV with her. Honey, I *tried,* but, let's be real, I have watched every episode of Gossip Girl with you, and I still don't get it.

&#x200B;

Apparently, she has latched onto this idea that she deserves extra votes, and I don't know where it came from. She said we were being ""unfair"" and called me a bitch. I called her an ""entitled twat"" and a ""whiny brat.""

&#x200B;

Mom texted me a little bit ago, saying that sis was still mad at me for being a dick, but I don't really feel like one. I mean, I was harsh, but I don't know that I would say I was out-of-line.

I called him “weird” that upset him at first but I convinced him that I cared a lot about him and just want to see him succeed, but he needs to mature a little more especially around the house. It hurt me to cause I will miss my family but I thought it was necessary since I know he looks up to me.

"AITA for not knowing that identical twins were a real thing, and becoming scared when I met twins?","This happened a few weeks ago and now in hindsight I am perplexed as to how I went through 30 years believing this, and some of you are going to think I am out of my gourd, and maybe I am, but I swear to you for the entirety of my life I thought that identical twins were a fictional creation. 

I don't know why, I just thought it. I never met twins in real life, ever. I only saw them in TV or movies. I considered them to be an entirely fictional thing, like a mythological creation, something on par with werewolves or ghouls or something. 

I even sometimes remember thinking how odd it was if in a show more grounded in realism, they would have an episode with twins. Like, why are they interjecting a supernatural element to this show all the sudden? And why is nobody commenting on how weird that is? 

So a few weeks ago when we were still coming into the office, I walked into the break room and I see a duplicate version of my teammate Greg standing next to him. Two Greg's. I froze in absolute shock in horror. 

Remember, I didn't think twins existed. So to put it into perspective, try to imagine how you would react if you walked into your office breakroom and saw a werewolf standing there, in real life. That is how I reacted. 

I gasped and let out a kind of moan/scream/squeak pathetic kind of noise and backed up to the wall and mumbled something like ""Ahhh, wh-wh-wh-wh-what is it!!!?"" 

Everyone else gets freaked out and thinks I am reacting to something else and is looking around confused. I pointed shakily at the doppelganger-Greg and kind of mumbled unintelligible words in fright. 

Greg, astounded, said something like ""Uh...this is my twin brother Tim, I'm showing him around"". 

When I noticed nobody else was afraid, I went further into the room staring closely at ""Tim"". At this point I was still freaked out, my heart felt like it was going to shoot out of my chest and I was jittery as a bean bucket. I started to think maybe it was a trick or something, so I was looking him all over up and down. ""How are you doing this?"" I demanded. Was it makeup? A 3D printed mask or something? An illusion? Projection? Augmented Reality? I had no idea. 

Anyways, it took about 15 minutes for people to convince me that identical twins were real and existed in real life, and I was meeting one in person. I didn't believe it for real until I googled it in front of them. 

Some people in my office think this is funny, but apparently Greg and Tim are really offended, and so are some of the other people at work. They think I was being really rude, and don't believe I didn't know what a twin was. Was I really rude to behave as I did, when I honestly was horrified? This is causing a lot of conflict for me at work and apparently a message was even sent to HR, I am really freaked out.

TL;DR - I didn't think twins were real and I freaked the fuck out when I saw a twin.",Asshole
AITA for shouting at the shop keeper for printing single-sided as opposed to double?,"Now this question has been bugging for a week when I encountered myself in a conversation with a printing-shop owner. To give a little context, since I moved to a new place, I was trying out the shop for the first time. I had asked the guy to print exactly 92 pages of a pdf file.  Now, turns out that the guy prints 92 \*pages\*, i.e., single-sided printing. To an environmentalist, that is a \*blunder\*. As soon as the printer had printed about 10 pages, I told him to stop printing so that could get a double-sided print. He denied, saying he could not stop it from printing.

All 92 pages in hand, I asked him why he never cared to ask me which style I wanted to print my pages in, since I believed double-sided printing to be a standard. He gave me one reason why he didn't: single-sided printing--on the other hand-- is the standard around the area, he said, because people like to write stuff on the blank-page as they read on the right.  What he was implying was that the onus was on \*me\* to tell him if I wanted a change of style; it wasn't his responsibility to ask me which style I wanted.

I offered--rather aggressively--two reasons in my defence: 1) Why is the standard single-sided printing? It makes sense to have it double-sided so that \*he\* doesn't waste any more paper--even if one's primary motive is to make more money (since single-sided printing costs the same as double-sided printing, generally), and not saving the environment 2) How come every one getting stuff printed choose to write on the blank page, as a rule? At what point did the guy keep it as a standard? Should he have told me that this was a standard here (which--of course--implied an offer of choosing which style to print)? AITA?

EDIT: I'm definitely TA for being aggressive--I realize that. However, am I also one for thinking why one would \*expect\* customers to know their standards? I realize that, well, one must know what one signs up for. But what specific norms of engagement entail \*asking\* what one's policies   
 are rather than the service-provider providing full disclosure upon undertaking the service?",Asshole
AITA for asking my vegan brother to cook non-vegan food at his dinner party?,"So, I'll host dinner parties with my family and make a couple of dishes. Maybe stuff like pasta dishes, buffalo mac and cheese, salmon, etc. Maybe once every two months or so if I can everyone together. Now my brother last year has decided to go vegan, totally fine, it is his life he can do what he wants. Issue is, now he has been asking me to cook more vegan options. 


Usually this winds up being more work and money on my end to make something that tastes fine, but not quite like the real thing. Not even removing meat is the issue, more trying to work around my staples of milk, eggs, cheese, and butter. So now I have an extra dish taking up more time and is always more involved than everything else. But it is family, I like having them over.


Issue is my brother has also started inviting family over for dinner. I was glad someone else decided to join in and host, but every meal is vegan. I don't mind the food, but I asked him if he can include some non vegan dishes as well. Something simple as adding in real cheese for pasta dishes. Or cheese and bacon bits with stuffed potatoes.


He got very upset with me saying how these products go against his beliefs and he refuses to give money to organizations that produce them. And as such he will not make anything non vegan at his events. I said that this was not fair that I accomidated his meal suggestions and that he refuses to accomidate mine. He says if I ""need"" to have those foods, I can bring them in myself. I said that is unfair since I made him dishes and never said he had to bring his own food to dinner. But if that is how dinner will work, he doesn't ""need"" vegan foods either and can bring what he wants to eat to my place.


I haven't invited family over for dinner in a while since I just don't feel like getting into this argument again. They all say I'm being an asshole for not just sucking it up and eating vegan for a night, and I argue that the issue is I go out of my way to cook vegan meals, I don't see why it is an issue at all for my brother to go out of his way to cook non vegan for me. So AITA for wanting non vegan meals?",Asshole
AITA For intentionally flashing my trucks brights at other cars?,"I recently upgraded my old truck with a new one, because of a recent promotion (gotta treat yourself). Since it is so new, it is equipped with LED headlights. Not the super douche bright blues, they are a mild white.

Now that I have this new thing, whenever I drive at night, I'll occasionally run into someone who assumes I have my brights on. This triggers thier inner asshole, causing them to flash thier brights at me.

Since this happens so often, I've started not flashing, but fully turning on my brights until the aforementioned asshole passes. My friend says that I'm an asshole for this. Am I?

1. My headlights are properly adjusted by a certified GMC mechanic

AITA for sending a d*ck pic to a friend and not the gf,"I was at work, a little turned on, alone in the office and decided to sent a d\*ck pic to the gf.  I was rushing because someone went out and I didn't want to be spotted.

I took the picture, sent it and then didn't look at who I sent it to.  The GF woke up later and I realised that I sent it to the wrong person, I sent it to a friend, that didn't see or open the message up.  I, because I made a mistake and wanted to remedy it, forwaded it to my gf.

Thinking this was ok, I explained that I sent it to a friend, deleted the picture and then apologised.  I admitted I should have been more careful and didn't mean and harm.  The gf didn't take this very well and is upset with me for doing it.

Now, my gf thinks I am cheating on her and sending my d\*ck to everyone that I know (which I don't.  I actually don't like sending d\*ck pics anymore, but I know she likes them.  No I have not told her this and I am aware that I should tell her this.)

All in all she isn't believing me.

As an edit, I have never hidden anything from her.  I have always been honest and open about my mistakes or the things that happen to me.  I don't lie, cheat or otherwise want to upset her, I just have really bad decisions making skills.  While that isn't a reason for my mistake, it is something that I am trying to manage and get better at, but otherwise so far failing at.",Asshole
AITA for getting my dog high before a bath????,"This my first time on this subreddit.

And English isn’t my entire language but I can understand pretty well. 

So ummm I just got done giving me dog a bath but before I got him high just a little by giving him less than like 1/2 tsp of cannabis in his food. I did this because every time I give him a bath now he has a panic attack and starts crying and it’s pretty miserable. 

The panic attacks started happening after I was gone from my home for a month and trusted my family to take care of him. When I came back he was happy to see me but was very scared of my dad when he was around him. When he started to stink I decided to run him a bath and baths where kinda a problem before but he would just try to get out the bath. Not full on trying to hold me, crying and wailing, and jump in my lap to find comfort problems though. It was very heartbreaking and I feel like my dad had something to do with it since he never liked my dog.

So I though giving him some would calm him down. And it did he just stood in the bath without crying, running, or panicking to get out. But I am at war at myself because I feel like I basically drugged my dog and I just didn’t want to stress him. But I feel what I did was unethical and I don’t know who I should tell. He is fine right now though he is right in front of my right now as I type this and is relaxed but I am scared that I might hurt him since he is a small dog and I am hoping I didn’t give him too much where it can be harmful to him. Or I should take him anywhere to be checked because i don’t know if cannnabis can poisonous to dog at a certain amount.

I not even sure if I am asshole but I feel like I put my dog in danger by getting him high and that makes a asshole.

I am a asshole or I am just overreacting???

Edit: err so I want clarify that I gave him a very weak THC oil and called it cannabis because I forgot they words on what I wanted to say.
It was very small amount of oil (like a small scrap of the tip of a spoon) because I was scared to give him a lot 

I did do my research now after the comments told I should. What gave him was not poisonous since he is like 30 pounds. But I am definitely at fault because I didn’t do my research before and could of put my dog at risk. He is normal, he response to me and walks and acts normally.

I talked about getting medication with my mom but she said that “that it cost to much money and we can take of him on our own blah blah blah” 
I can’t  pay for it since school coming back up and I don’t have a stable job. I have to spend the money i do have for school supplies. 
 
I was recommend to give him CBD treats instead to help calm him as method to calm him down.

I understand that this my fault and I shouldn’t have done this in the first place and betrayed my dogs trust",Asshole
"AITA for telling my mates a lady's ""secret""?","Throwaway. Real account connects to my university. 

---

Been getting my leg over a lass for some months and bragged about her to my mates. Was a bit of a wind-up because these loons are starved for company, so I might've detailed her more than she'd be happy with. Mind, I said nothing about her baps or fanny or what have you, but we were having a good chinwag and I'm a gossipy fuck. So I tell them about her sneezes. See when I was first chatting her up, I swear she always sneezed like a bloody mouse. Weird, but cute. Told them, they laugh, I laugh, and Bob's your uncle.

About a fortnight ago she sneezes normal. Thought it was an outlier, yeah? So I make a joke, she gets mad and admits it's a cute act put on to impress men. Disguising a sneeze… never heard of something so daft. I tell her that and I'm put out for the night. Deserved it, I know. We get back to it a day later.

I tell my mates, because who wouldn't? Good laugh, that. Didn't think they'd ever meet her, but last night I was legless and invited her to the pub. They get on well until she sneezes all high-pitched and cute and Freddie goes mad and can't contain himself. Lots of giggling all around. He calls her a lying cunt and starts squeaking like a mouse and yeah, I'll admit maybe I shouldn't've joined in but we've been taking the piss out of each other all night and she's usually up for it. It was a cock up and she calls me a catalogue of insults and leaves. Then I get a text saying I betrayed her trust by telling them her ""darkest secret"" and I about lost my marbles. It's a blooming sneeze. The bloody fuck does she mean *""darkest secret""*? I've got a darker secret on my own arse. 

I had another pint, don't remember the rest, and woke up this morning in bits and don't know if I should be apologizing. I lurk here enough, figured I'd ask you lot if I'm an arsehole for snitching on her cute act because I feel like a wanker, but come on. She's being ridiculous. She could sneeze out a fart and I'd still shag her.",Asshole
AITA for saying I cant get a boner from ugly people,"So I (19M gay if that matters) was walking home from a the club with a girl friend (19F)and a friend of hers (19F). My friend begins talking about how people in their 60s began hitting on her last night and said it was gross. 

I then shared a story about how I was offered 500 bucks to sleep with a 61 year old. I jokingly said I would have accepted but I really cant get a boner when im sleeping with someone I find ugly so it would have been impossible»

She her friend says: «What are you guys talking about» to which I just repeat what I said.

She then loses her shit and says «Wow you’re absolutely disgusting, why would you even say that? Saying that someone is ugly, like you are that good looking? And why would you even bring that up?!»

1. I brought it up because we were talking about creepy old people
2. She asked what we were talking about, and I replied
3. Its common fucking sense that you wouldnt be able to maintain an erection if you sleep with someone you’re not attracted to. 
4. Maybe ugly was a rude term, maybe I should have said «unattractive» but if a synonym of the same meaning flips you off you need a spine

"AITA for emailing my son’s art teacher on the last day of school, telling her that she “wasn’t worth his time”?","My son (15) has been doing online schooling, and today was his last day. The state made doing schoolwork optional for all students, but it wasn’t optional for him. He did every last bit, or so I thought. 

Apparently my wife had decided to leave his craft assignments unchecked, and they agreed to tell me that the teacher had stopped posting. When I found out today, I was furious. I didn’t really think it through, so I immediately went to email the teacher. Here’s what it said:

“Hello, this is <son>‘s father. I’m so sorry that he hasn’t turned in any assignments for you. He and my wife decided that you weren’t worth his precious time that he could be spending doing all the super important things teenagers do. I have told him time and time again that his job is school and that his grades are the priority, but like I said, they went behind my back to screw you over. I have the utmost sympathy for you, as I am victimized by him and my wife on a daily basis. I hope you have a good day.”

A couple of hours later, the teacher emailed me back, adding both my son and my wife onto the email. She said:

“Hello, most of my students took my class for an easy A. The majority of them have not turned in any work for me, and I do not hold it against them for prioritizing their more important classes.”

My wife was furious. She told me there was a reason that they had kept the art class from me, but I wasn’t hearing it. I’m the one with an important job, I’m the one who provides food, shelter, and comfort and they owe me respect for that. I told her this, and she took my son and they went somewhere. She said they’d be back.

AITA for not showing no remorse?,"When I was in university, I had a horrible temper. Examples include but are not limited to:

1. At the student lounge, there were arcade games. Any time I lost, I would throw chairs, scream and curse, attempt to topple the arcade machine. I once blacked out, and it was brought to my attention hours later that I had smashed a billiards cue on the arcade game. However, anytime I won, I would be giving out chest bumps, standing on chairs, etc. I was as much of a bad champ as I was a sore loser.
2. On occassion, whenever I got a bad grade, I would remove myself from class to go to the bathroom to scream it out. One particular incident, I was in a building that had horrible acoustics, so everyone could hear me screaming and shouting and cursing. Apparently people got so scared that the whole floor had to be put on lockdown. It was embarrassing. IMPORTANT TO NOTE: That particular incident, I removed myself from the classroom to not cause a scene, and when I was screaming and cursing, I made sure I didn't say anything that could be used against me.

My actions in example 1 gave me the moniker ""Hangtime Kid,"" because NBA Hangtime was my go-to game. A few months ago, a classmate and I were having a discussion on a mutual friend's Facebook, when he called me ""hangtime kid,"" which really upset me, because I felt like I was a better person than I was 10 years ago (my freshman year of uni). 

Apparently, this friend was still upset with me because his girlfriend at the time (they broke up a long time ago) had a PTSD episode because of me. I didn't know she had PTSD nor did I intend to trigger an episode. Apparently, she has PTSD from her abusive father who shouted at her and once sent her flying down a flight of stairs for eating her dinner too slowly. Had I known someone had PTSD, I would be mindful, but I'm not gonna tread eggshells. If you can't handle a voice higher than 5db, fuck off home.

I did apologize for my actions, but to him (and other people who went to university with me) it doesn't matter because I'm still the same 18-year-old asshole to him. I apologized for my actions, but I told him that he was being ridiculous for holding actions from a decade ago over my head as if that's representative of who I am today.",Asshole
AITA for getting mad at my mom for not taking my coming out better?,"Okay, so I’ll provide a backstory to this:

About a month ago I realized that I was actually a guy (born female), got a haircut, and started coming out to people I’m especially close to.

Almost everyone I’ve told has taken it really well (I live in a very liberal area), which makes me very happy.

However, there is one person who did not take my news well, and that person is my mother.

The funny thing about that is that my mom has known I’m not a girl for way longer than anyone else I’ve told I’m trans because three years ago I told her (and my dad) that I was gender fluid, as I thought I was at the time.

Neither of them were great about it, especially my mom, who never used the right pronouns, so I eventually gave up on correcting her, but still brought up my “not-a-girl”ness every so often.

Then a day or two before I came out to her as a guy, I got really tired, and when I’m really tired, I act like a drunk person: Get very emotional and lose my filter.

While I was in that state of mind, I basically confessed that I was a guy to my mom; I said I’ve always thought of myself as pretty masculine and craved facial hair, and I even told her that I wanted to take hormones.

She didn’t really respond to any of this.

Now flash forward to about a day or so later, when my mom is driving me to school. I take on a very serious tone of voice and tell my mom I have something to tell her, then say that I’m a guy.

My mom then says “But-“, and then I exasperatedly cut her off and finish her sentence: “...you’ve never shown any signs of it before.” I’ve confessed many things to her over the years, and that’s almost always been her response.

Anyway, so since then she consistently got my pronouns wrong, even refusing to use the correct ones, and kept calling me her daughter, and I got mad at her, saying she’s the only one that took it badly out of everyone I told, and said that I understand if she messes up my pronouns, but that she wasn’t even making an effort.

She then blew up, saying that she was making an effort, and even said “I’m accepting!” I scoffed when she said that and replied “If you have to say that it shows it isn’t true,” at which she became furious, saying that she didn’t know what the right thing to say was, but that she was trying her best.

I don’t feel guilty about this, but should I (going to make an edit to add more possibly necessary info because this is getting too long, most of the info is here already, and I need a break)?

EDIT: In the past, when I was only out to my mom as gender fluid, and I would try to gently and politely correct her when she used the wrong pronouns, she would say I was attacking her or that then wasn’t a good time to talk about it. She also said that it was hard for her to refer to me as they/them because she’s very strict with grammar and she’s not used to they/them as singular pronouns, and that if I wanted to be referred to as he/him that would be easier since she’s used to those pronouns (obviously a lie). I also realize that it’s hard for her to accept that “her perfect baby girl” isn’t that at all, so I feel like maybe I shouldn’t have been so harsh on her.",Not the A-hole

Now I have a $400 bill for taxes  owed that were entirely because of his job.  He says he should only pay  half because we split our account in half when we divorced.  I say he  needs to pay all of it because his job caused the tax in the first  place.

I have a habit of putting my pencils in my jacket pocket after I'm done using them, so I did it with her eraser. She asked me where it went and I gave it back and apologized no problem.

This happened a couple times and then suddenly she exploded and told me I couldnt use it. No big deal I accepted it. So I was helping my friend (( the one who's account this is)) and Eraser girl made it rudely obvious that I couldnt use it. Like told my friend not to let me use it at all.

So I asked her why? Because eit was rude, and she exploded on me on how I was being inconsiderate and not caring. I told her that it was an accident out of pattern and she told me that it wasnt that. That if it was an accident I would have tried to stop it and it would have only happened once. 

Accidents dont always happen just once. So we got in a mini arguement and she just made me feel like a massive jerk. I talked about it to my friend and she backed Eraser girl up.

AITA for only complimenting one cousin’s appearance and not the other’s?,"I (19F) have two cousins (9 & 7) who are half sisters. The 7 year old Tori is very pretty and looks like she’ll be my doppelganger when she grows up. The 9 year old Tiffany objectively isn’t pretty at all.

She never seemed to mind not getting the same compliment as Tori. 


On Sunday, I saw them again and complimented both of them in a similar fashion as I always do. This time, Tiffany asked me “so you don’t think I’m pretty too?” I told her everyone is pretty in their own way, that her long wavy hair is gorgeous and her fashion sense is very good. She didn’t seem to like my response and sulked the whole time I was there.


My mom pulled me in to another room and told me that it hurts Tiffany’s feelings when I keep complimenting Tori on her appearance and never Tiffany when she’s right there.

AITA for berating a friend over using the wrong pronouns for my child?,"So I posting this on behalf of my friend “D” who has fell out with my friend “S” to find out who is in the wrong. For ease, I’ll write the below as though I am “D” 

D- “So I am a trans male, who has been with my partner for a while. We welcomed a baby recently and announced on Facebook we had a girl. 

After a discussion with my partner we decided we didn’t want to raise our child to be confined to a gender and wanted to allow them to choose their own, so we have decided to use neutral pronouns and have asked people to refer to our child as “they, them” etc.

When talking to “S” about the child, she kept taking ages like she was having to think about what she was saying and was hesitant. I ask her why and she said “I’m trying to make sure I don’t use the wrong pronouns as I’m use to referring to her as a girl, so I’m making sure I think it through” which really annoyed me as it’s not that difficult. I told her she was ridiculous,and that it’s not that hard and if she struggles that much she shouldn’t parade around like a advocate for the lgbt community if she can’t do this simple thing. We fell out over it.”

Extra info is that the baby is now a year old, they decided at 9months to go with a neutral gender. 

“S” is a straight white woman, who we know as she brought her younger brother to pride when he came up because he was too nervous, “d” has always had a chip because in his words, she doesn’t know the struggle of coming out and fighting to be who you are and that’s why he’s arguing she’s in the wrong.

“D” however has decided that he no longer wishes to associate with someone “so toxic like “s”” And has decided to continue to badmouth her, call her a homophone, transphobe and everything in between.

AITA For Not Promoting Solely Based On Performance?,"I'm a sales manager at a tech company and we have 2 young sales reps at our company who got hired at the same time about 1 year ago. One's a guy and ones a girl, they are both like 22/23 and great at their jobs. Since its been one year at the company from them both and they both have excellent performance (the girl does edge him out every quarter though) we were looking to promote one of them into a closing sales role that would be a large bump in their compensation and life at work. I decided to promote the guy because he does have an amazing sales record in his year here (although the girl has slightly better numbers), he has more confidence, more business acumen and is a great presenter. When I told my wife about who I promoted and why she called me a huge asshole/douche/sexist for not promoting solely based on numbers but I think a lot of variables are at play and the guy was the stronger choice.

AITA for not letting my boyfriend listen to Britney Spears?,"OK so it’s not as bad as it sounds it the title, I promise!

So I (21m) and my bf (27m) have been dating for about a year, and it’s being going great! Except for one thing, we constantly bicker over music. He is a big pop fan. Mainly Britney, Busted, Lady GaGa etc.

Now I honestly don’t mind this for the most part. I mean it’s pleasant enough , better than nothing - whatever.  But when myself and my friends get together for a drink/smoke , music is our central theme. 

We all also love music , we are all musicians and basically music nerds all around. So we love to show each other new albums and new artists and just sit and discuss them. Now not to say we don’t talk about other shit, but I’m just trying to get the point across that the music is a big part of the night. 

So when my bf who we will call Ross puts on Britney Spears (except Toxic) or something it kinda kills the vibe.  Last weekend he wanted to put on busted and I was just like “nah man not right now , later” and he has been in a mood since. Says I’m a music nazi. Pretentious. Trying to be cool. Blah blah

When I’m with his pals I just let them play whatever and wouldn’t ask for anything I like because I know the room wouldn’t like it. Ross can read the room fine, he just doesn’t care.

AITA for yelling at a girl to put her jacket on after the teacher told her to,"In senior year, there was this girl in class who was a supposedly feminist. Okay I don’t mind that. But the week the male teacher started enforcing dress code to her (she wears tank tops and shorts when it’s not allowed), she just kept arguing with him back and saying how sexist he is being and that the class valedictorian is wearing a white tank top & it’s obvious he’s being biased. That I can somewhat agree but she could just put a damn jacket on and stop being attention seeking. It has been the 5th day, and I slammed my hand on the table and said “Put your damn jacket on, you have it in your backpack!!” She was causing beef with my republican friend Jonnie. So that’s what motivated it. She slowed the whole class down just for her own self and because of her, we would get hw for the night. She then started crying and the teacher thanked me afterwards. Now that I think about it, I overstepped and caused her to feel low.",Asshole
AITA for telling my dad that if he doesn’t take certain pictures down then I won’t visit,"So, some context, I (m18) am a trans man (ftm) and I currently still love at home and am attending high school. My parents are very supportive for the most part, there’s a few things that they can’t seem to grasp about all this but I’m especially lucky to have the amount of help and support that I do have from them. 

One point of contention between my parents and I are old pictures of me. Now, they wouldn’t be a problem if they weren’t hung up, (and we don’t even have that many pictures hung up anyways, most of them of my older two siblings and other family members) So, I asked if I could edit the few pictures of young me that are hung up (I’m pretty skilled in photoshop) so that I wouldn’t want to spontaneously combust anytime I happened to go upstairs. This started a mini argument, since my parents were both against me making any changes to them. I later talked to my dad, bringing it up again, and he again said no, so I responded with, “well, if you won’t let me edit them, then I’d like you to take them down and if they’re put up after I’ve moved out then I’m not visiting your home.” 

He then agreed to take them down, because our relationship is strained enough already (for very different reasons) and knows that my saying that isn’t just an empty threat. I just want to know if my asking to edit the photos and then telling my dad that I won’t go into a house with pictures that make me feel uncomfortable is an asshole thing to do? Idk, I might be bias (for obvious reasons) and I’d like an outside perspective. 



INFO: there are only 2-3 pictures, I didn’t yell or get especially angry at them (nor them with me), I’m annoyed but that’s expected, and I haven’t refused to visit them at all due to this, I just refuse to make myself feel shitty if I don’t have to. I accept that just because people do and say things that make my dysphoria worse doesn’t mean they’re shitty, like when a stranger misgenders me or when substitutes forget to say my last name even though I asked. People aren’t perfect or immediately aware of my situation and I don’t expect them to be, but I don’t think it’s too much to ask for my Parents to do things that help to make me feel more normal.",Asshole
AITA for not donating to a kid that has cancer?,"I made this to get some unbiased opinions because people are making me feel like shit.

At my office one of my coworker's 9 year old daughter got a deadly form of cancer (Mesothelioma) . He has been doing everything to raise money for the medical costs as our insurance isn't the greatest.

However, my coworker is a massive prick as well. When my grandfather was dying and I was leaving work early most days to spend time with him, my coworker reported me to the higher ups and I got written up and had to cut my visits to him. So he's not someone I sympathize with.

Recently he started collecting donations at the office, everyone except me gave some money. Someone else noticed and asked if I was donating, I said loudly so he could hear ""nope, not donating anything."" Since then, people have been giving me crap even though it's my money and I am not obligated to give it to anyone.

Mesothelioma also has a really low survival rate so if his daughter is going to kick the bucket, what's the point in donating?",Asshole
AITA for being angry at people for recognizing my small friend?,"Today I snapped at my friend group for making comments that acknowledges my female friend for being a small person. 

To help you better understand, I am very average. Average 21 year old female that is  5'5"" and 140 pounds and possibly average to below average looks. My friend, Kate, is 21 and is 4'7"", probably under 100 pounds, and is decently good looking (I guess?). Anyway, for the past few years I have noticed that friends, parents, professors, and coaches always make comments about her height and size and its always in a positive light. 

Examples

* my teammates always refer to her as ""the small one"" and she always gets to be int he front of the line up and get to hold the sign while the rest of us have to stand behind her. My teammates will always make sure she is shown in group photos (simply because shes small) but they don't care if I'm in the picture. 
* professors would joke about how she couldn't the top of the white board or joke about how they couldn't see her over her computer because she's so small and short 
* boys would often make sexual comments about how ""she is probably too small to ride a dick"" or how ""entering her will probably split her in two"" and while I agree these are crass and over sexual they never make these comments about average girls
* When we go out to bars or crowded places she is always sitting on someone's shoulders but when I asked my friend (male, 22, 6'1"", can hold me) to lift me up he said he couldn't or wouldn't. Not only this, she is often being lifted up by boys and bigger people because ""she is easy to throw around"" 
* She has a boyfriend that is 6'7"" and everyone always comments how ""they have a two foot height difference"" and I don't know why it matters. No one acknowledges other couples that are three or five inches different. 

I told my friend group that I feel like Kate gets more attention and is seen as a cuter, better, prettier person simply because she is small. They all stuck up for her and said it's not her fault. I know it's no her fault but I feel if she was average sized and height no one would acknowledge her. I believe that people should not be acknowledged just because of their small stature.",Asshole
AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for a book character I made,"Dummy account because my girlfriend goes to this sub.

For background I have been with my girlfriend for years now, and it's the longest and most serious relationship I have come across. She's a very kind and beautiful woman, I've never really met someone who was as good as her as a person and partner. Though, I have done a lot of vices in the past which have made her become almost extremely paranoid of me.

Anyway, I've been writing this book for a while now and got her into it. She was very supportive of me. However, when I asked her what she thought of my protagonist on a talk at the phone, she replied with an ""Ehh she's alright.""

That honestly triggered a ton out of me because this was a character I poured a part of myself in. I thought that of all people who would actually really like my creation and it wasn't someone who I trusted and loved most. I yelled at her, and then she ended up getting mad back because I apparently ""couldn't take an opinion."" This went on and escalated into her blocking me in almost every single account we have and she wasn't planning to talk to me yet, even in real-time. God forbid she even wanted to see my character ever again, she said I could keep the character and continue the book but I had to stay her out of it.

I've asked other people about it and they said that she should have tried more, since she is my girlfriend after all. I just wanted her to appreciate the character, now I'm not sure if that was too much to ask.

AITA?

Edit: Alright, I'm the asshole. Thanks to everyone for sharing their judgments. I should have known it was stupid to be so attached to a character in the first place. I guess I was getting so much good feedback that I didn't expect it from my girlfriend and overreacted, even the therapist said I needed to hone down around her.",Asshole
AITA For yelling at a women for losing her kid at a festival?," 

# For yelling at a women for losing her kid at a festival.

📷 

So  there was a festival today. Bout  3,000 people. At one point i see that a  little kid wondered up to the stage where these guys were performing.  They were on a break and i could see that the kid was upset and the guys  were figuring out he was lost. So they make an announcement ""child  named ""mike"", lookin for his mom, anyone"". Cut to about 5 minutes later  and the guys have been keepin the kid company along with another women.  Then a woman walks up, doesnt even get within 100 feet of the stage and  opens her arms as if to say ""here i am"". The kid runs up to her and off they go. Now a few things bothered me. One is how long it took her to get there, it wasnt a giant location. It took her an awfully long time to either notice he was gone, or to get to him. The other thing which enraged me a bit was that she didnt even have the fuckin appreciation to go up and say thank you to the strangers who sat with her son for 5 minutes and tried to make him feel better. 

So i walked up to her after she had walked away and said ""hey"" she looked at me and i said ""Nice job losing your kid at a festival, couldnt even say thanks to those gentlemen up there for takin care of him, smarten up moron"" and walked away. The women didn't say anything, i think she was surpised. My wife said i shouldnt have. I get tight about kids being abandoned and shit, it doesnt take much and suddenly the kid is gone forever.  The way she was so nonchalant, she wasnt even upset or anythin just ""oh silly where did you go off to. Like an airhead.

AITA for liking dream catchers?,"Okay so I really like dream catchers, and I have a lot around my room. Last night I was just playing some video games and my mother walks into my room absolutely disgusted by the fact they are on my walls. She then flips out at me for not listening to her about taking them down as she has asked in the past. I try to calmly tell her I just really like them. She responds with if I'm under her roof I have to do as she says, and my stepfather agrees with her. I think this is totally random and unfair because she favors my 2 siblings but does this to me for no reason. So AITA?

Edit: Okay so a lot of you have some fair points, and our asking for info. I really have nothing to add, they do not have anything strange or unusual like no strange markings, bones, slurs, etc. They're just normal dream catchers. Like I understand the meaning of them and their cultural impacts. I have indeed tried to ask why my mother does not like them but I got no response. I did take them down as asked even though I strongly disagreed with having to do so. I just can't find a reason she dislikes them so much.
But thank you all for agreeing that I am NTA or giving a reason as to why I am. I appreciate all of it and I read all the comments to come up with a fair conclusion as to why she does not like them.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my waiter cousin I made more then him in three hours then he did all weekend?,"I have a cousin (by marriage) that has been doing nothing with his life. At 30 he as 3 DUI in 2 states, almost lost his life due to drinking, and generally just not a good person. My wife an I have bailed him out jail, flew out when he was hospitalized. And have done everything for him. We have tried get him on his feet, and tried to be a positive influence in his life. 

Ever since he moved back he doesn’t make any effort to come around, he never talks to my wife, and only contacts us when he needs something (which we stopped helping him). This weekend at a family bbq, he was boasting about how made $300 in tips this weekend, and I said great! Now you can payback the $1000 for bailing you out of jail. 

I went on to say, how $300 in a weekend is good, but you have the potential to make more, and could be like me making $300 in less then 3 hours if you would just back to school, eliminate the group of people holding you back...

My MIL said I was the asshole for saying that a family bbq, but how else am I going to get my point across when he never reaches out... sorry for the grammar mistakes I’m little emotional, I care about him and just want to him succeed and not have an early grave like his dad.

Edit: let me clarify he is not trying to better himself with his job, he works to pay for his drinking and is bouncing from couch to couch and keeps getting kicked out.. even his mom has kicked him out several times this year because of it.. but my wife side of the family tends to brush things under the rug and I exposed them with my comment

He then calls me a liar just kept saying ""How can that be possible, bullshit"" etc. So at this point after a solid 10 minutes of him pestering me I just ask him what % of his net worth is his house and he said probably 95% and I said my house is like 5% of my net worth and that's why I get a 1.5% interest rate and you get a 4.8% and told him he should have kept renting.  then it was just awkward for the entire night",Asshole
AITA because I don't support my sister's life choices?,"I (31F) have a younger sister, ""Lee"" (28F). Lee recently came out to the family as a lesbian and also introduced her partner to us. Apparently they'd been living together for a while but my sister kept it secret. I'm a Born-Again Christian, married to a man, cis-gender, all that. I don't support gay marriage.

I won't blast you for it, I won't preach at you, I don't discuss my beliefs in public, religious or otherwise. If someone tells me they're LGBTQ or anything like that I just go along. I don't let it affect my daily life. I'm not one of those people who say I'll divorce my husband if gay marriage is legalized or anything. I believe in everyone being happy and living their lives. But, as a Christian, I can't personally accept gay marriage. However, I do believe everyone should have the right to wed whoever they want. It's just not for me.

My sister and her partner, ""Kim"" have recently announced their engagement. My sister has asked me to be her Matron-of-Honor. I declined the honor. Originally I told my sister the reason I was declining is because I have a lot of family and work responsibilities and I didn't think I'd be able to support her like she wanted. But, some changes happened in my life and my sister asked me to reconsider. I once again declined.

My sister knows how I feel about gay marriage. I don't express my beliefs freely but if someone asks me I tell them the truth. I'm not some god-awful person who wants everyone to live the way I live. If my sister desires to live her life openly and fully as a lesbian with a wife and, one day, children, then I say let her. I want everyone to be happy. That said, I can't stand up at her wedding when I don't support her lifestyle. I just can't. I'd be making myself a hypocrite and I feel like it would tarnish my sister's day. My sister was not in my wedding, she also declined the honor because she said she didn't like being in the spot-light.

My sister finally asked me point-blank if I was declining being her MOH because of my beliefs and I said yes. She asked me why I couldn't put aside my beliefs for one day to support her, saying she'd do it for me. That's great if she can do that, but my beliefs are my beliefs, I don't believe I should have to compromise them. Naturally my sister has taken offense and isn't speaking to me. I'm sorry she's hurt but I have never hidden how I feel from her. She's known how I feel for a solid decade.

AITA for refusing to let my housemate eat my food after she tried to report me for shoplifting?,"Background info: I shoplift food, like, a lot. I know for a big chunk of this sub that already makes me the asshole by default, but frankly I don't care.

Anyway I love cooking for people and I live with 5 housemates. We all do separate groceries, but every monday I'll make a big meal for everyone, mostly using the ingredients I steal.

So I've got this one housemate called Jill who moved in fairly recently. Last weekend I told her I was going out to pick up ingredients for the House Dinner, and she asked if she could come with cos she needed to do shopping too.

So we're at the self-serve checkouts buying our groceries separately, and I've got the shit I'm planning to steal in my bag, and next to me Jill pipes up ""hey aren't you going to scan that?"" I told her to knock it off and, I shit you not, she waves over the attendant and says to him ""that guy has stuff in his bag he hasn't payed for""...

I was fucking livid! I told the clerk ""I'm sorry I must have forgotten about those items, I'll just pay for them now"" which was clearly bullshit but he didn't do anything cos he's literally getting paid minimum wage and doesn't wanna deal with a shoplifter.

When we get out of the store I ask Jill what the fuck her problem is she just tells me that shoplifting is wrong and I shouldn't do it if I don't wanna face the consequences... Like what the fuck? Who does that?

Anyway we get back to the house, I'm very angry, I talk to my other housemates about it and they're like ""yeah that was a shitty thing for her to do. I guess don't go shopping with her again."" I'm like ""I guess...""

THEN! On Monday night I make my big house meal, and everyone comes down to eat. And Jill comes down and is about to grab a plate when I'm like ""what do you think you're doing?"" and she's like ""getting... dinner?"" and I'm like ""Absolutely not. You tried to rat me out. You don't get to eat my food."" She's like ""Well what am I supposed to do for dinner then? I haven't made anything cos I was planning to eat this.""

I just ripped into her about the absolute entitlement of trying to rat someone out for shoplifting for no reason at all and then still expecting to be able to eat the food they've made with shoplifted ingredients. Then I told her she can figure out her own dinner. She just went to her room after that and didn't come out for the rest of the night.

It's been a few days since then and my roommates don't think I'm an asshole, per se, but they are upset with me for quote ""making the house dynamic weird"" and think I should apologise and let her back in on House Dinner. I maintain that Jill made it weird when she dobbed me into the store clerk, and that it's totally hypocritical for her to eat the fucking dinner. I said I'd reconsider if she apologised to me but I'm not going out of my way to mend this bridge.

Again, I know a lot of you will think I'm an asshole cos stealing is wrong no matter what or whatever, but, ignoring that, I really think I'm in the right here. AITA?

EDIT: You guys were right. Well some of you were. I talked to Jill and she said that while she knew I stole food, and used stolen food for the dinners she didn't actually think I would shoplift while out with her. She said she got really anxious and panicked when she saw me trying to steal food, and then doubled down on her reasoning when we got out of the store cos she was embarrassed and still panicked. She's a pretty anxious person so that all tracks. I apologised for shoplifting in front of her and also for yelling at her in front of the house cos neither of those things were cool for me to do. She also apologised for ratting me out to the shop guy. 

So we're all good! I said she's welcome to house meals again, and we've agreed to not do any more shopping together lol. All's well that ends well! Thanks to everyone on here who gave me good advice and to everyone with a stick up their ass about shoplifting, all I have to say is: Crime is a social construct, Walmart's not your friend, and I think you're all incredibly lame.",Asshole
AITA for saying offensive jokes in a private chat?,"Me and my friends (all 19 M) have a pretty dark sense of humor. We play games online together all the time, and we'll always say shit to each other over Discord, like ""you fucking retard,"" ""fag,"" or tell each other to kill ourselves when we make a stupid play. We also say the n-word pretty frequently and a make a lot of racist and offensive jokes. I know it's pretty fucked up, but none of us take it seriously or are offended by it. We obviously keep it all within our friend group and never even think about saying stuff like that when other people are around. This friend group is also completely separate from my college friend group since I go to school out of state.

Recently, my college friend group was talking about the Harvard students who got their offered rescinded because of their offensive meme group chat. They all agreed that they were assholes who deserved it. It made me think, am I an asshole too?

EDIT: I'm realizing a lot of things after reading comments. After an overwhelmingly ""YTA,"" I was going to have a serious talk with my boys and try to make a stop at all of this. We've never had issues with our humor slipping out in inappropriate situations or thought we were racist, but all the comments here lead me to believe that it is still not justifiable by any means, and that we might harbor some deep, dark hateful sentiments towards certain groups of people because of our constant banter. I even made some comments saying that I'm going to try to change.

But then I read [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cjyirf/aita_for_saying_offensive_jokes_in_a_private_chat/evhg1eo/) comment, and I realized that pretty much sums up our situation. 

We're not racist. We don't hate any group of people because of their race, sexual orientation, or anything else they can't control. Out in the real world, we take these matters seriously. We are minorities too, we've experienced it and all agree it is bad. We joke about it and laugh because we understand how fucked up the situation is and how it has no place in our society. Why is it okay for Key and Peele to make jokes about different races but not us? Intent is the same, it's just humor with zero intention to offend. 

I disagree with everyone saying racist jokes are bad no matter what. I think they are bad when they are laced with hate for the group, but that is not the case at all with my group of friends.

In regards to the n-word, I see where people are coming from when they say not to use it. And again, I don't ever, and will never use it in a public place. But honestly, in my group of friends, the n-word has no meaning to us. We grew up around black people casually throwing it around, so to us it's the same as using ""bro"" but just in a more explicit way. It's not tied to any one race or negative assumption for us. Of course we know the history behind it and the negative connotations, which is why we never use it around other people. But the context around which we're using it around each other is not hateful/racist at all, so we do not see much wrong with it. We go to rap concerts all the time, and no one ever has any problems with non black people yelling the n word as part of the lyrics to a song. 

Downvote me, report me, do whatever you want. These are just my updated thoughts, and I would love to hear actual conversation instead of ""racist jokes = bad.""",Asshole

AITA for refusing to pay $50 for the “effort” my coworker put in for a fixed $25 lunch.,"Few weeks ago I (21 M) went to a baby shower lunch my coworkers threw for a coworker we’ll call “Jane.”  I’m not even friends with most of my coworkers and I think Jane is just okay (lol), but I thought since mostly everyone in the office was going I'd be nice and go too. The organizer of the event, “Meredith,” called us individually to verify we’d be okay with paying $25 for the fixed meal at a CHINESE RESTAURANT. Now can we all agree that CHINESE FOOD is one of the cheapest food out there! I was already turned off by the exorbitant price of this “fixed menu,” but I decided to go. After the lunch, the girl Meredith venmo charged me FIFTY BUCKS. She split the whole bill evenly, saying she was too lazy to split it by drinks (like she said she would multiple times!!) 

Even though a couple coworkers bought MULTIPLE DRINKS for themselves and I had only a water. I told her I’m only paying $25 + tax/tip. Its absolutely ridiculous for her to verify multiple times that the meal would be $25 and that she would split everyone's bill based on what they ordered, only to get LAZY with it and venmo us all $50 to pay for other people's drinks!!!

Another coworker Alan said I was overreacting and that Meredith went through alot of effort and even purchased a gift for Jane in our name. WELL EXCUSE maybe she should have put in this “effort fee” and “gift fee” in her initial estimate so I would have known not to come!!!!

It wasn’t even unlimited food and I had the worst time. I arrived at 11:30 and we weren’t served the meal until 1 PM!! 1 PM!! The appetizers, was just a skimpy serving of the grossest eggrolls ever (that we have to share family style). And although the main course, LITERALLY JUST CHICKEN FRIED RICE was good, that is HARDLY $25 worth.

If some people are comfortable with tipping her for her “effort” on an event that wasn't even necessary (I’m sure Jane doesn't even like half of us lol) then they can do as they please, but I’m sure as hell not helping pay for someone else's bill. FOR CHICKEN FRIED RICE LOL. I’m sure even JANE’S BABY WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT MENU LOL.

Apparently now Alan is upset at me for wanting to approach Meredith about this and complaining about the meal she put so much work planning saying this was a ""communal event."" AITA for only paying $30.

AITA for calling vegans “glorified picky eaters” ?,"So this happened at lunar new year.  

Characters: Younger Cousin (lets call her Emily), other younger cousin (Alex), and me.

Context: Alex is 7, and a pretty picky eater. Nothing crazy, just can’t get him to try new stuff much. Emily is 14, and a die-hard vegan. I’m 19, and the oldest person at the kids table (so no adults to manage) (it goes by generations, so that’s why I’m there)

About a month before, Emily had told us to make sure there was vegan dishes she could eat. Alright, we could deal with that. We also knew Alex was a picky eater, so we accommodated for that too (which really took no effort at all, he likes the traditional food we make)

So we’re at the dinner, and Alex is refusing to try a vegetable dish, but eating everything else. Perfectly expected, no big deal, he just won’t touch it, he doesn’t make a fuss about it. Until Emily decides to call him out. “Alex, eat the vegetables. All the aunts and Uncles and cousins took the time to make the food.” And she nags like this for a few minutes. I eventually get tired of this and go “Emily, you’re trying less of what’s on the table than he is, go back to your food.” She responds with “well I’m a vegan. He’s just being a picky eater” I point at the 2 vegan dishes that before this point would not have been vegan. “You realize we had to take the time to change two dishes just for you right? From the kitchen, Veganism is just picky eating, and you were more of a hassle than he was.” 

And she goes crazy, calling me an environment killer, no respect to other cultures, “some people need to eat vegan for health” NONE OF WHICH IS RELEVANT TO HER, she did it cause her friends did it (I got this straight from her mom’s mouth).

And that’s basically the end. I just shut her out and went back to eating my duck and chicken. So reddit. AITA?

Edit: I guess it’s reasonable to add this. The amount of dishes they both try is relevant conversation. My family has a tradition of everyone above 16 try every dish out of respect to the people who took the time to make it, and children younger than 16 are encouraged to try as many as possible for the same reason. (She’s our first vegan/vegetarian, and first with any dietary restrictions whatsoever, it may become very messy when she turns 16)",Asshole
AITA for expecting my wife to pay to repair my guitar,"I’ve always loved guitars, which my wife has always known. I found a decently priced one (still several thousand dollars, won’t name the model for anonymity) and bought it with my wife’s agreement. When I got it, my wife told me in passing that I should put a lock on my office door where I keep my guitar to keep the kids out. She only told me once, and it didn’t get done. I’ve only had it for a week.

My wife stays home with our kids, who are all toddler age. She also waitresses at night for some extra money. She was home with the kids and wasn’t watching them all properly and one got into my office and knocked the guitar over. It will cost several hundred dollars to repair (and a repair already feels like a compromise because it will never be the same.) 

I feel that my wife should work extra shifts and my mother can watch the kids during the day so my wife can make the money to repair the guitar because it wouldn’t have been damaged had she been watching the kids properly. She thinks it’s my fault for not putting a lock on the door, but it had only been a week. She wants me to wait and save up my fun money to repair the guitar.

AITA for being friends with someone that my wife isn’t comfortable with?,"A couple years ago, when my wife and I were dating, I brought a friend over for a picnic style dinner.
 
He is a pretty raunchy kind of guy. He makes jokes about all types of things. He makes a bunch of pretty racist, and other dark type of jokes. He, himself is half Indian and half White.
 
The thing is, he makes racist jokes against basically everyone, so I guess it sorta cancels it out? IDK, I’m not exactly defending him, but his jokes are funny.
 
My then GF didn’t like him at all, and asked that we break up. I didn’t, but I just separated them into two different parts of my life.
 
After about 5 years, they once again collided. She found out that I was still friends with this guy. She’s calling him a bad influence. The thing is, she hasn’t noticed that I’ve been friends with him, so he can’t be that much of an influence.
 
Also, she can’t dictate my friends. She doesn’t talk, text, or even see him. I totally think that’s fair. She has friends that I don’t like, I’m not going to ask her to lose them!

Of course lots of alcohol, etc. I didn’t want my gf coming in any outfit that was frisky or skimpy to receive the wrong attention from guys who I’d have to fend off all night long. We talked about this beforehand. She shows up in a tight, short black dress and heels. I met her outfront and said to her that I didn’t want her coming in like that for a couple reasons, first because of the drunk guy attention, secondly I didn’t want my relatives getting the wrong idea of who I’m dating.

AITA for expecting my wife to do housework?,"Got your attention? Good. TLDR: I work 2 jobs, wife only has 1, shouldn't she pull more housework than me?

I work two full time jobs, 74-80+ hours a week. My wife technically has 2 jobs but one is tutoring a kid for 1 hour a week, the other is as a ""teacher"" at a very small private school but she only has 5 kids.

We're driving the other day and she lets out 'I know I don't make very much but I am happy there' and I let slip 'happyness isn't everything, sometimes ya gotta pay bills too'. Queue the silence for a hot minute.

I'm not religious so my expectation of her doing housework isn't that she's the domestic part of the relationship, I'd be perfectly fine if she wanted to go make money and have me barefoot in the kitchen. Why must I come home from 12 hour midnight shifts to do a kitchen full of dishes and laundry/stuff all over?

AITA For telling my sister she should get an abortion?,"This is a bit hard for me to post.

My sister (30F) has a very high functioning form of autism, which isn't apparent when you first meet her. She is very cheerful and overall everyone likes to be around her. She met a guy a few years ago and they ended up marrying.

I (32M) was happy for her and glad that at least she has someone who will be by her. However one night they announced to my family that she is pregnant. It seemed like no one had an issue with this, but I don't think she should take on the huge responsibilities of being a mother.

I tried to get a read on what they are planning to do with the baby. When I was alone with my sister, I told her ""I don't think you should have a baby, you'd be unfit to raise it, you really need to think about abortion and talk it out with your husband""

My sister got extremely anxious and didn't say anything and ended up leaving. A day later her husband came to my home and yelled at me for telling her to get an abortion. I told him ""okay and when the baby falls down the stairs and breaks its neck because his mother forgot to watch him, it will be all your fault for deciding to have it."" 

The husband told me not to contact them again, which is bullshit because she is my sister and I certainly will. Plus, I don't think it's fair for their child to have an autistic mother.",Asshole
AITA for reporting my VP for using racist language to announce new hires?,"I work for a regional office for a large financial institution. I am a manager. Recently, we had two promotions in the office --- two employees that got promoted to management. The two individuals are white men. This is only relevant to how the promotions were announced.

First promotion was announced (in a meeting with 200 of the staff"": ""Congratulations to Joe! He is a homegrown boy, a local boy, and we're proud to have him on board"".

When the second promotion got announced a few weeks ago, the VP announced it by saying,  ""Congratulations Vic! Born and raised from this part of the neighborhood, he truly knows this territory. Vic is a Northern boy who's going to continue to do great things \[..\].""

I found the language offensive. I am an immigrant woman. I have an accent. I am not "" homegrown"" and I don't think that being homegrown should be celebrated in a professional environment. To me, it sent a message that being from here and a ""good ol' boy"" gave those individuals an edge... something that is entirely out of reach to the rest of us.

I complained anonymously but  I won't know the outcome, nor will I know whether he will be found of any wrongdoing. My husband thinks I am being too sensitive.

AITA for Seeking Prayers at a Scheduled Prayer Service?,"Hello all. This week I was at a prayer service at my college fellowship. We have these once a week, and they are open to the public.  A student at our school died recently in an accident, and so there were more people at the service than normal. Lots of people were crying. I did not know him, but I still prayed for him with everyone else. 

During the service, people offer up statements and some ask for prayers. This time, lots of people were remembering the student but a few people asked for prayers for sick relatives, one for her cousin who was struggling with drug addiction, and then it came to me. 

I broke up with my girlfriend of about 3 months two weeks ago, and it has been really tough on me. She was also at the prayer service even though she is not as Christian as I am and normally was not there. She just happened to know the student who passed away. I asked people to pray for me that I recover from my breakup and that in the future I only date people who truly share my religious values because those people would not be hurtful. 

Fast forward to that afternoon, I got messages from several of my friends telling me that asking for prayers, during a prayer service, was inconsiderate. My ex girlfriend also sent me a message telling me that she found it hurtful and that she would prefer that I not speak about her again, at least not when she is present. I asked her what was wrong with what I said, and she told me I was attacking her. I was not! I never attacked her. 

I understand that people there were suffering, but we all suffer for different reasons. I am also suffering. I have never had such a tragic breakup, and I thought she was the one who I would marry. I was already looking at rings, and then she just broke up with me. I have a right to be sad, don't I? I have a right to ask to be lifted in spirit--we all have different crosses to bear.

WIBTA if I call out my [newly] ex-SO for not wishing me a HBD?,"Asking in advance of my bday to ponder the verdict.

My ex and I split exactly 1 month ago after dating for about a year and a half. It was sad for both of us and had nothing to do with a lack of love for one another, we just recognized that we wanted different things in life and concluded it wasn’t fair to ask the other to compromise their goals. I reached out via text a couple of weeks ago just to say, “How are you,” and we exchanged some friendly messages about our families and such. As far as I know, we’re both doing the best we can to stay busy and adjust. 

Anyway, the reason for my post is that my birthday is coming up and I’m already anticipating not receiving a text from my ex. I think about this person daily and am still dealing with the sadness, and the thought of feeling disregarded by them on a special day is already making me feel a little blue.

AITA for wanting to be involved in my granddaughter's lives?,"My son walked out on our family the day he turned 18. He valued his girlfriend over his family and decided to move in with her parents and they took on all of his finances. I never liked this girl, I have many reasons why, but that's not the point of this new issue.

I have had no contact with my son in 15 years, but my MIL does and I hear information about him through her. He is still with the girl that took him away from me, they got married at 22 and had a $30,000 wedding that I wasn't invited to. They own a $10,000,000 mansion in a Washington DC suburb, and they both have really good jobs. His wife's parents paid for him to go to private University with her and they both have advanced degrees in a selective field. 

He also has triplet daughters. They're 7 and according to my mother in law they're the most well behaved, beautiful, intelligent children to ever grace the face of the earth. They go to an elite private school and are undoubtedly spoiled.

That was one of the reason I hate his wife. She's spoiled. People try to argue that she's very grateful for everything she's been given so she's not that bad, but I feel like any child who was never told no and got everything they ever wanted is a horrible adult to be around.

Anyway, I had my mother in law give me their address from the Christmas card they sent to her and I drove down there over the weekend. As soon as my son's wife saw me she locked me out and screamed for my son to ""deal with this."" I got a glimpse of one of my granddaughters as my son opened the door.

My son told me that I had to leave as I was trespassing on his property. I told him that I have the right to know my granddaughters. He said ""You don't have granddaughters. I have daughters."" 

We went back and forth for half an hour, I was adamant that I wouldn't leave without meeting them. I heard his wife say ""If that woman so much as lays eyes on our babies I will..."" (I couldn't hear the rest) That sounds like a threat and I think if the police get involved I can use that against her.

I want to file for grandparents rights for visitation if  my son doesn't let me have a relationship with my granddaughters. I told him this and he called me all kinds of names, including asshole.

AITA for telling my biological son that he is adopted?,"I (36M) typically have a pretty good relationship with my son, Jake (12M). However, sometimes he can be a handful and although I try not to, I occasionally lose my temper.

A few days ago, I get a call from Jake's school about him acting up in class. The teacher told me about some of his actions, which included pushing a female classmate, and I was pretty disturbed. I pick him up from school early since the principal said he had to leave for the day, and I start lecturing him in the car (I wasn't yelling).

This sets Jake off, and he starts yelling that he hates me, and wishes I wasn't his dad. This really hurt me, as I always try to be a good father to him and I felt this was really below the belt. So I responded: ""You're in luck, I'm not your dad. Your mother and I adopted you.""

Jake starts bawling, and hasn't spoken to me since. To clarify, Jake **is** my biological son, I only said that as a response to what he said to me.

"AITA for reporting someone for not following the rules, even though it wasn’t bothering me?","So people in my life are calling me TA for this but I kind of felt like I was doing the right thing so I wanted some unbiased opinions. Btw, I’m on a throwaway.

For some background, I have always been a rule follower and I have never been a troublemaker. Ever since I was in elementary school, having this personality has strengthened my bonds with teachers and IMO, encouraged me to work harder and be successful.

So I’m a college student (19 M) and I take a history class where my professor will lecture for the entire class. He is a pretty chill professor and he teaches pretty well. It is pretty easy for me to retain information because the way he gives it to us is just amazing. Anyways, he has the basic class rules like being respectful to him and not using the class as social hour, but the one “odd” rule that he has is that he requires all of his students to take handwritten notes. He claims that this will help us retain the information better.

I would also like to mention that the classroom is pretty large. It’s big enough that he can’t see what everyone is doing with detail, but no matter where you sit, you can hear clearly and see the board. Anyways, I have always taken my notes and paid close attention, and I have been doing pretty well. This semester, a new girl, we’ll call Kayla, has decided that she prefers to take her notes on her iPad. We both sit in the back (literally the last row), so our professor doesn’t really notice, but she does throw a notebook over her iPad to cover it if he starts to roam around the class while he talks. On the second day I noticed her taking notes on her iPad, I reminded her of the rule, because I didn’t want her to get in trouble. Kayla told me that she was aware of the rule, but claims that she doesn’t like writing because her hand hurts after awhile, so she types her notes on her iPad. I left her alone after this.

Last week, I mentioned to our professor that Kayla was using her iPad to take notes instead of hand writing them, and he thanked me and I left. The next time that class was in session, the professor walked over to Kayla and told her to put away her iPad and hand write the notes, and it was her last warning. Kayla got pretty pissed at me and called me TA for snitching. I told some of my friends the story and some of them called me TA because I could’ve just minded my business because it wasn’t bothering me, but some of my other friends said that I was justified in telling the professor because Kayla technically wasn’t following the rules.",Asshole
AITA for calling out a wedding guest for dressing too showy?,"Throwaway account. This happened this past weekend.

I was a bridesmaid at a wedding where the dress code was black tie optional. 

The guest in question was an old family friend of the groom, and she was probably in her mid 20s. While her dress was not overly formal or risque, it was very glamorous and attention grabbing. It's hard to describe, but she was wearing a sparkly blue cocktail dress that was probably designer, and stilletto heels that were absolutely designer. Her hair and makeup was also so perfect, it must have been done by a professional. Honestly, she looked like she walked off the red carpet of a movie premiere. 

She was certainly grabbing attention. During the cocktail hour many, many guests (none of whom know her) approached her to rave about her outfit. The bride noticed and while she didn't say anything, I could tell she was bothered by the split attention. 

At the reception, I ran into her in the bathroom and made a comment like ""nice outfit, but who are you trying to impress here? You're just a random guest."" She told me to mind my business and she left. I retold this story back at the table, and while a couple bridesmaids were on my side, some thought I was too harsh.

WIBTA if I refused and didn't visit family? Sister has newborn. Wants all visitors to get a flu shot.,"First off, I'm not some nutty anti-vaxxer. I get all vaccines, boosters and have not had any issues with accepting a vaccine my doctor recommends. I've even considered an experimental vaccine (malaria vaccine when I went to visit tropical countries for a long time) ultimately didnt get it due to its low efficacy. My doctor doesnt push me to get a flu vaccine and tells me its optional.

My sister gave birth the other day and she said while pregnant months ago that anybody who wants to come visit the baby needs to be vaccinated including the flu vaccine. She never asked me directly but its one of those things I heard through the grape vine she said. Like I said I have no problem with normal vaccines but I draw the line at a flu shot. I'm a healthy male in my 30s, my doctor doesnt recommend it and I'm not in a ""priority group"" for the vaccine (those immuno-suppressed, elderly or very young) nor do I work in healthcare. I also think its foolish to think I can vaccinate myself against a virus that constantly reshapes itself rendering the flu vaccine given that year either useless or of diminished utility the next year. Something just seems silly to me to get a vaccine that will be rapidly obsolete and repeating the process yearly. I'd just rather keep myself healthy in the first place and maintain my immune system. Personal anecdote: I did get a flu shot once in my early 20s and damn it, I got the flu a few days later. So my faith in flu shots is pretty low. Maybe when I become elderly I'll change my mind but for now, no thanks.

Anyway, on to my sister. My wife and I have plans to go visit family for thanksgiving soon and we will have a chance to see my sister, family and the new baby. My hope is that she has forgotten what she asked for or maybe she just blurted out the flu vaccine idea due to ""pregnancy brain"". I dont know. She hasnt called me to make sure we get the shot and now with a new baby in her arms, she might never ask me directly since she has 100 other things going on. Does she really want the flu shot for every visitor? I dont know but I'm not asking.

Wife and I discussed this and we decided that if this is a show stopper for my sister, we just wont go see her or the baby. We'll take thanksgiving day to go visit a city nearby or do some site seeing, anything else. Im not going to argue with my sister in her own home nor do we want to create drama; we'll accept whatever is the course of action that results. Of course, I'd feel guilty for just not caving and missing my family and newborn nephew. But something internally rebels at the thought of constantly vaccinating myself against the flu. The best outcome I can hope for is this issue never comes up and she forgot about flu shots for everybody. What do you guys think? TA or not?

Edit:  id like to add that I have seen my sister and her husband since I learned about her desire for a flu shot.  We also were over her house a few weeks ago.  Nobody mentioned it to us ever so Im left to believe it was a rumor or maybe something she said/considered and ended up not wanting.  We all chat and talk regularly and nobody said anything to us about making sure we are flu vaccinated before visiting.  I made this post so I could prepare for the worst case scenario.",Asshole

She works as a teacher working 60-65 hours a week making around $65K. I told her if she works another 15 hours tutoring people she can easily make $15K-$20K. She can easily be debt free in around 18 months. If she gets another job or starts tutoring people, I can help her and she'll be done quicker.

She is calling me an asshole because she already ""compromised"" by agreeing to do a budget.

I told her doing a budget means nothing if we are not cutting our spending and increasing our income.

She said that working 80 hours a week will be bad for her mental health (she has a history of depression).

I told her that I had/have depression (as diagnosed by the doctor).  If I can do it, she can as well. I also told her that her mental health will be worse with the debt hanging like an albatross on her neck. Hell, paying of debt is important for my mental health because it is stressing me out.

She resents the fact that she, in her words, ""never sees me"" and that this will hurt our relationship.

I told her that if we didn't figure out our debt problems, we would definitely get divorced because money problems cause fights.

She said I was a asshole and cheapskate because I am demanding we reduce our spending on food by not going out, not eating fancy stuff like avocado, and not spending money on Netflix. Currently, we are paying $450.  She thinks that $350 per month on groceries between the both of us is too low.  It isn't.

Breakfast: Milk and banana ($0.40)

Lunch: spaghetti ($2) or salad ($3.50). 

Dinner: two cheese ($2) or tomatoes/cucumbers without cheese($2.50) sandwiches.

Total is ~$5-6 per person per day, per month ~$180. We can meet the $350 guideline if she stops buying avocado ($0.50 per avocado), she only eats salads on the weekends, and we shop at a different grocery store for some other things.

I told her to cancel her gym membership ($40). She can run on the streets. She called me an asshole for suggesting this. Apparently, I wasn't checking my ""male privilege"" because she feels afraid as a woman, running at night. She has never told me this before. I told her we can arrange our schedules so she can run with me. I cancelled my gym membership and run alone in the park. 

She wants to go on a honeymoon after our wedding, but if we don't get out of our debt, I am not going to enjoy the honeymoon because I will feel guilty due to debt.

She is now calling me an asshole for valuing money over her. She thinks I am being ""too intense and obsessed with debt."" She says I am trying to control her life.",Asshole
AITA for telling one of my dad's friend to f off,"A little information about me: I am 6'0 and 210 pounds with a good build.This happen about two years ago, when I was attending college. During this time I was 18 when this happen. I was trying to get enough transfer units to get into my favorite university. One thing that does trigger me is how people think community college is useless and doesn't help at all. I hate those people.

Cast: Me: you know, Dad's friend: DF, Dad
This happen on Monday when I was home for the day after my classes. I had an important exam coming up next week so I got my laptop and sat on the kitchen table to start studying. After 30 minutes, my dad walks in with his friend. My dad waves at me.

Dad: hey son, how was school?

Me: It went good and I barely got here an hour ago. If you don't mind I have a important exam next week, so i don't want any interruptions right now.

Dad: Sure son. Good luck on the exam. Sorry if we make too much noise

Me: Nah it is ok. 

After the interaction they went to the backyard to fix his friend's car. I decided to put on some earphones so I don't have to listen to the sounds they were making in the back. After a while, my DF came back and I didn't notice him because I was too focused on my studies and my music was pretty loud. I think he was waving at me but I didn't see it. After a few minutes, he smacks his hands on the table and this is the conversation that happen:

Me: (surprised because I didn't expect someone to do that and I took off my earphones) Yes can I help you with something.

DF: (in a loud demanding voice) Yes I wanted to know where your restroom is? 

Me: Go down the hallway and there is a restroom on the left

DF: Ok 

After that I put my earphones on again and started to study again. I was thinking I don't want to have any issues right now so I will just ignore him. He comes out of the restroom and starts waving, I see him this time.

Me: Yes!?

DF: Do you really just waste all your time on your laptop and not pay attention to us adults when we are asking for something.

Me: Excuse me!? I am studying here because I really care about my education

DF: Yea so what. I mean college isn't really that important, you should tried going to the university instead.

Me: (me already angry) Who the heck are you to criticize me?

DF: (in shock) I was just voicing my opinion and you don't have any rights to talk back to an adult like that

Me: (almost screaming) I don't have the rights to talk back to you. I am 18 years old and I am already considered an adult. For someone like you to approach me the way you did, I don't give a sh*t if you are my dad's friend i will kick your *ss

DF: ....

Me: Ok then if you don't have anything else to say just f off and leave me alone.

My DF goes back with my dad and didn't say anything to him. After my DF leaves with his car, I tell my dad the whole story and we laugh it off.",Asshole
AITA for bringing in donuts to work and taping a sign excluding a coworker who is consistently right wing?,"Okay, here goes. Obligatory not a shitpost, this happened unfortunately and I am swinging between regretting the entire thing and then laughing about it. 

I’m 27, work in an office (big office) with hundreds of co workers and we are all split into teams on different floors.

We ALL usually get along, I’ve been interning at this company since I was 18 and people know me. I’m a liberal queer POC which frankly is enough buzzwords to trigger this one co worker, Sharon. Sharon is an older creole lady in her 60’s, and has been my bosses bosses Secretary for maaaaannyyyy years. As such, she’s considered ‘untouchable’ in the company. Unfortunately; she’s also a trump supporting person who frequently spouts right wing ideals, and it’s just annoying and also unprofessional.

Literally on Thursday this woman said to someone (I overheard) that gays need to fit in more with the idea of a ‘nuclear family life’ which obviously pissed me off. The guy she said it to us gay and he *Agreed* with her which further upset me because no one should have to meekly agree to somebody out of fear.

I picked up donuts on Friday and bought them in. As a joke I taped a sheet of paper to the inside lid saying ‘everybody is welcome except for Sharon and MAGA
Voting self, because these donuts came from a non nuclear queer home’ 

Because she doesn’t work with us, she never saw it but word got back to her even though people were laughing and telling me it was awesome. When it gained traction I quickly tore the sheet out and threw it away but the damage was done and my bosses boss called me in to her office to ‘remind me of company best practice’. She didn’t mention the paper but I got a lot of pointed looks.

AITA for refusing to watch my sister’s dog?,"My sister has a 110 lb Great Pyrenees that she loves more than anything in the world. The dog is friendly enough but I’ve never liked dogs. I think they are annoying, needy, loud, messy, and overall they just really aren’t my thing. Not to mention her dog is HUGE so it’s 10x worse.

My sister found out her husband had been badly injured while on a business trip and apparently it was a pretty serious situation. She left work and went straight to the airport to get the next flight. While she was at the airport, she texted me asking if I could go to her house and watch her dog for her.

I said no. I am not comfortable with that large of a dog, and like I said I really don’t like dogs at all.  She begged me but I held my ground.  I understand it was a frightening situation but she really should have taken care of her dog before leaving.

She called me crying because I was the only one nearby who could watch her dog. I said sorry but I just wasn’t comfortable. She asked if I’d be willing to drive her dog to our parents 5 hours away. Again, I said no. The dog sheds like crazy and is prone to getting carsick, it would absolutely wreck my car. Plus I felt that asking me to make a 10 hour round trip was a little inconsiderate bc I work full time and have school in the evenings.

Eventually my parents showed up to get the dog but they were pissed at me. They said I was being a selfish asshole and that I should’ve helped my sister out. My sister hasn’t talked to me since. 

I feel that I was well within my rights to refuse to care for the dog for an unspecified amount of time because it made me uncomfortable. My parents and sister obviously disagree.

Btw her husband is fine and is recovering well.

AITA for telling my wife she needs to remember that she has a husband,"My wife and I have been married for almost a decade. She is very caring and attentive and has always wanted to be a mother. We were unable to have biological children but recently adopted a baby boy. This has changed things.

Ever since the adoption, my wife has been entirely focused on my son. She rarely makes the time to talk to me beyond basic “how was work” type questions and telling me to change the baby’s diaper or hold him. She has stopped doing all the little things for me that made me feel loved.

I tried to sit her down and remind her that she has a husband too, and I have managed to balance time with the baby and being there for her. She got upset with me and told me that she’s still adjusting to motherhood. I told her this is something she could take into account. She said I was rushing her and being condescending. She then decided to accuse me of not stepping up and doing as much as she is. I got angry and I will admit that I yelled that she takes me for granted. She took my son to her mothers house and told me she needs time away from me. 

I know it escalated and blew up, but I feel she’s being unreasonable and irrational at the moment. Am I the asshole for reminding her that she is a wife and not just a mother?",Asshole
AITA for excluding our friend's son from photos?,"We have a daughter, 1yr. They have a son, 10mo. It was our daughter's birthday two weeks ago and we hired a photographer to take photos. All of our friends and their children (anywhere from 4mo-3yr) came, including the titular friend. We had photos of each kid, each kid beside the cake, even some group shots. But we told our photographer to exclude our friend's son from specific photos. He still got lots of photos, but none with our daughter, he wasn't in the group shot, et cetera.

Why? Their son has a physical disability. Some sort of musculo-skeletal thing, we don't know the name and never asked. His face is perpetually grinning with his lips almost in a caricaturized way. Whether they plan to get corrective surgery I don't know. To put it blunt (and this might be point one where we're the assholes), he's unsightly. We didn't want him in photos we planned to hang around the house or put in our album because, to be frank, he ruins any photo he's in. 

His face is unfortunate and it's not his fault, but we paid for the photographer to take nice photos, stuff we could put up, and him being in any of them was impossible. He still got lots of photos, everyone did, and we forwarded them all to our friends, it's just in those specific photos we wanted to put up, we asked the photographer to frame him out of them or just exclude him entirely.

No one has questioned anything because no one knows the reasoning. According to everyone else, everything is hunky dory, nothing out of the ordinary happened with the photographer. But are we the assholes?",Asshole
WIBTA if I cut off my friend for forgetting my pronouns?,"I guess the title says it all, but let me explain further. I´ve been identifying as male since I was about 12 years old. From what I´ve been told I pass well if that matters. I´ve always had a hard time with correcting people when they mess up, but recently I´ve actually been really good at it. I correct everyone when I hear them use she. Well theres this one person. I´m not sure if I´d call her a friend, but I do talk to her everyday. I only met her about 4 months ago, and she has NEVER known me as female and neither have any of our mutal friends. Well she has a habit of using incorrect pronouns and when I correct her she´ll have that ¨ok whatever¨ attitude and carry on using the wrong pronoun in the conversation, sometimes going back to she in the same sentence. She´s good at using the new name I picked out for myself (its gender neutral) so my thinking is: how do you use a different name for someone, know why they´re using a different name, and forget why you´re using that name in the first place? I don´t know , I feel guilty any time I confront her because everytime I do she says ¨ok well I forget and I´m trying¨ for me personally, I just don´t think she takes it seriously. I have other friends that have said the same thing, but they don´t use she everytime they talk to me or about me.  Actually this ¨friend¨ has never ever used he in the time we´ve known each other.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I just distanced myself? I feel like an asshole because of the things she says when I try to say anything. But at the same time I don´t want to be around someone that throws out everything I told her a second ago. And it´s really uncomfortable for me when she uses the wrong pronoun in front of others and then I have to go ¨wait no that´s wrong¨ because that basically outs me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Ok apparently people are just either ignorant or just lack common sense. I don´t really claim this person as a friend, but she calls me her bestfriend. There´s a difference between a stranger doing this and someone who claims you as a bestfriend doing it. I could give less of a fuck if a stranger does it because I don´t have to spend everyday with that stranger nor does that stranger get to introduce you to others with the incorrect pronoun, and in the process humiliating you. Basically if you don´t understand what trans people go through, your opinion most likely just won´t matter to me. Im asking people if I´d be an asshole for cutting off my ¨friend¨. I don´t care about the fact that you think I should just get over it and accept that people are too lazy to be a decent human. Sure people will always do that shit to me, but I dont have to accept that from people I associate with :)

&#x200B;

So from reading the comments I´ve come to the conclusion that I´m NTA. Thanks you to everyone that helped me. I can´t believe I even questioned my own self worth.",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling out my coworker for just fucking around on her phone in the bathroom?,"I’m on a small team of software developers. Four months ago K joined the team. The thing about K is she’s ALWAYS going to the bathroom. She’ll go twice as much as anyone else when we have team meetings. And sometimes she’s in there for 20ish minutes at a time several times a day. 

I noticed when she goes to the bathroom she always grabs her phone and takes it with her. So I told her at lunch one day it’s not cool for her to just fuck around in the bathroom on her phone during meetings and that she needs to do as much work as the rest of the team. She told me it’s none of my business and she still gets all her work done. 

That just pissed me off so I told her that she doesn’t get to do whatever she wants just because she’s the only woman on the team. She got very quiet for a moment and then once again told me it was none of my business. She then said that her going to the bathroom so much is a disability accommodation and if I didn’t drop it she would file a complaint with HR. But she’s in her mid 20s and she works out a lot and is very obviously not disabled so I told her so. 

Now our manager who is also the CTO wants to talk to me and I’m just so annoyed because she’s obviously just fucking around, but I guess that pointing that out makes me the asshole. So Reddit, what do you think?",Asshole

AITA for not making my kid follow the dress code?,"We moved from California to Florida and the school my kids go to now has a uniform, something my kids previously had no experience with. My 4 year old is in preK and last year as he was in a self contained class(he has autism) he did not need to wear a uniform. This year he was moved to general ed. I was surprised to learn he was supposed to wear a uniform. Teacher told us this on the first day. I basically refused. He has sensory issues so he doesn't like the polo shirts and I'm not willing to force him to wear something uncomfortable. Plus he's 4. And autistic. He likes being in control of his clothing choices and since he's so often not in control of anything as he's forced to try and act like a typical kid(not by us, just societal expectations and school rules) I figure I can let him wear the clothes he wants. I told her I'm not making him wear a uniform. This was in August. Last week he came home and said the teacher told him he would have to change his shirt if he wore a ""picture shirt"" again. I figured this was something in relation to upcoming picture day and he misunderstood. Today he was sent home with a note that said ""please follow the dress code"". Now I think this is because today he was wearing a shirt that said ""Love wins"", with rainbows. We all have matching pride shirts from a few years ago and he loves his ""rainbow shirt"" as he calls it. He was wearing this shirt last week when the teacher told him no more ""picture shirts"". I'm thinking of just writing ""No"" in response to his note but im wondering if I'm blowing this out of proportion and my judgement is clouded because I have other issues with this teacher. So AITA?

AITA for telling a young girl to use the ladies toilets?,"So this just happened at work not long ago, co-worker says i should have stayed out of it but whats done is done.

I was cleaning the bathrooms when a dad and young girl (10-12) came in. Our signs arent the most clear and people mix up what door is for who all the time, i figured that was the case at first but now i doubt it.

So heres what happened, girl goes to walk into the mens which the dad points out and says the ladies is the other one. She gets defensive saying she can use what toilet she likes, he was trying not to make a scene since there were others waiting for the toilet to and started to talk quietly (couldn't hear what he said) but she responded loudly repeating what she said befor adding in he needs to ""get with it""

At this point i cut in, i didnt get to involved i just pretty much repeated the usual speach that mens are on the right and ladies are on the left. After that she went into the ladies and he went into the mens and i figured all was good. I heard later from my co-worker that she was grumbling about not being allowed to use the toilet she wanted to at which point i was told i should have stayed out of it.

In the end nothing came of it and i personally dont think its a big deal and honestly i dont think shes wrong but were a service station with all manner of people coming and going. End of the day it's just a safety issue.",Not the A-hole

AITA for calling an associate... “A cuck?”,"The term “associate” in my title is a bit loose as i had only met the man a few times. We had know each other through the cosplay community that my then GF was an avid member. The man in question was a rising photographer. His work was good, but not great. 

Once during a meetup, I met his... girlfriend? She was pretty, certainly out of his league. She also wasn’t a part of the community so naturally i was curious how they met. She was actually a model he took pictures of a few times. They told me that they were so in love, they didn’t hesitate to move in together. All kinds of flags are going up in my head.

Then the unimaginable happens, another guy shows up and kisses her, HARD. I cant describe how awkward i felt in the moment. I pulled my GF aside and asked what the deal was. She said their relationship was polyamorous. Of course i could not stop asking questions. 

Turns out they, the “COUPLE”, haven’t even had sex in the few months they were together. (Or at least since they decided that they were poly) The more information i got the more horrified i would become. She would bring guys to the room they shared and have him take walks for hours. Im for people being in open relationships but this seemed wrong.

All day i avoided watching this girl make out with and caress another guy while her “BOYFRIEND” shrunk into a corner. I was noticeably uncomfortable FOR the guy. I thought he was getting taken advantage of because he liked a girl. Out of nowhere she leaves with the OTHER GUY but not before kissing the first guy on the cheek and says, “see you at home babe.” I cringed.

I don’t like when people are used by their SO’s and i wont hold my tongue about it. But i decided this time i would just tell my GF. I told her, “that doesn’t sound like a real relationship to me. Sounds very one sided and thats not fair.”

GF: “She just likes sex, why is that such a big deal?”

Me: “Why haven’t THEY done it then? They live together. Sounds like sex would be easy. He clearly is bothered by it too but doesn’t say anything. That’s not a boyfriend, thats a cuck.”

My gf calls me an asshole and we say nothing the rest of the night. I never saw them again. My gf stopped bringing me to the meetups she knew he’d be there. I hated going anyway. 

Was i an asshole for just speaking my mind? 

Guy i knew was in a POLYAMOROUS relationship but it seemed like it was an excuse for the girl to be a floozy while he waited on her hand and foot. In private, i told my GF that he sounded like a cuck. She called me an asshole.

LONG STORY SHORT: Guy i knew was in a (air quote) POLYAMOROUS (air quote) relationship but it seemed like it was an excuse for the girl to be a floozy while he waited on her hand and foot. I called him a cuck (not to his face) and GF called me an asshole.",Asshole

We walked in at about the same time as another party of four, all adults. They were seated within 10 minutes, while we were left sitting and waiting. I wasn't okay with that as both kids were starving.

After 20 minutes, I was through with waiting, so I called over a waitress. I asked why a party of adults would get seated before a family with hungry kids. She told me that they had called ahead for seating.

AITA for blaming my mom about issues between her and dad?,"My mom and dad divorced seven months ago because of religious differences and issues. In June last year, it escalated significantly between them and dad divorced her. They divorced because my dad planned to marry a second wife, as a Muslim he has that right, but it was something that my mother refused. She wasn't having it and that's when he divorced her.

My dad is a religious fanatic, and he has been the same person ever since Iran, before we came to America more than a decade ago. My mom on the other hand, is not a religious person, she never cared about Islam or what it stands for. Dad left mom, even though she cried and apologized for making him angry, (she hadn't done anything wrong) dad was selfish and left.

I was going on a vacation with friends during the summer and would be back home in September. Mom didn't want to stay alone, she asked me to rent one of the rooms in our house to Jeffrey, because she wanted to have company, especially when I was away. Jeffrey is a 23 year old guy from our neighborhood, he has always lived here, I'm not a close friend of the guy but I know him.

At first I was a little unsure considering that he doesn't have such a good reputation and have been imprisoned several times (not lately), but I listened to mom and gave him a room in the house. I had no other option because he was the only one seeking a room to rent in our small neighborhood, because he was crashing at his friends house.

When I got back from my vacation, I found out that my mom and Jeffrey have been dating since June, just a few days after I left. I was shocked and didn't know how to react. Barely a week ago my dad came back and wanted to remarry mom, (unaware that she was in a relationship) she accepted and broke up with Jeffrey. When he found out about Jeffrey, hell broke out. He's blaming mom for treason and cheating.

I didn't support the relationship my mom had with Jeffrey, but I didn't want to stand in her way. My dad is going crazy and has been since he found out. I'm pleased to see mom and dad as a couple again, but dad is more insane than ever. I blame mom on this one because in my judgement she rushed a little bit too fast and started dating after dad, I know she was divorced at the time, but i happened so fast.

AITA If i replace the guitarist in my band for being fat?,"It’s not just his (27m) weight, he is also always stoned and late to practice. Not to mention he pays literally no attention to the way he dresses; I mean that’s the surely the one easy part to fix but he doesn’t care. 

His weight though has went through the roof since when I (24m) started the band 2 years ago. He has gained about 50lbs. Totally ruins the aesthetic of the band on stage. He looks like someone’s dad or something.

Right now we are at a point where we are getting bigger and better gigs where we actually make some cash. I want to take the band to the next level, and to do that we need to look cool. It’s a fact. You need to look cool. He doesn’t look cool.

"AITA for making my wife go stand out to reserve a parking space I saw, causing her to get confronted by another driver?","We live near a large, popular shopping mall, that has a small parking lot and is always extremely busy. It is rare to find a parking space even near the entrance. 

We went to the mall tonight and as I was searching I saw an empty space in a close spot but I was one aisle over. I told my wife “go out and stand in the space and I’ll be right over”. She was hesitant but I told her to do it or else we would lose our opportunity because there were other cars driving down the aisles. She complied. From the time she got out until I got to the other aisle and to the parking space was less than 20 seconds. As I am approaching I see another car hovering near her and my wife is pointing at me as though to say “talk to him”. 

I roll down my window and this man is screaming that I can’t do that, that I can’t reserve a spot by putting a human in the space. I told him to immediately to move and we had an argument. The man also began screaming at my wife.  I began beeping and screaming for him to leave and move out of my way. Meanwhile my wife continues to stand there. She then started to say “let’s just go” but I told her to not move until the man left. The man just sat there for a good 2 mins and I finally had enough and I yelled to my wife to move so I could park. As she was moving I cut in front of the man making a left turn into the space (he was coming the opposite way) and I parked and he sped off.  

After I finally parked my wife seemed upset with me and told me she hates confrontation and that she wishes I didn’t make her stand there. I told her that because of me, we have a good parking space and she should be happy. I got out and walked into the mall and she pouted and walked behind me. She acted abnormal the entire trip and I finally told her I was leaving. Now she is still acting upset.  I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, but she is making me start to feel like I did.",Asshole
"AITA? Stock tip leads friend to make $300,000 and they tip me zero. AITA for wanting money?","Ok so here's the dealio. My friend, who i will call K, invested in Tesla in march at the start of the whole pandemic in the US. She got in at 650....she invested about 70k. Her plan, as she told me, was to sit on it, and in like 20 years, it'll be worth millions (her 70k investment) because in her words ""it's the next apple or microsoft""

enter me: i'm a poker player, and I know a lot about trading. I told her that she needs to short this stuff for sure. Take advantage of Elon Musk's mouth and the fact that every time he speaks his stock price has an equal chance of dropping as it does of rising.

My plan......K should wait until it rises to 900 or so, and then put a sell option in at 850.....and when the stock drops (i had a feeling it would bc its Tesla it's volatile as hell) she'll make money bc people bought it at 850, and then she can re invest at whatever it drops to (i belive it dropped to somewhere around 750 when this happened.)

So K doesn't take this advice and put the sell order in and her stock price drops to 750...and she then RE INVESTS more money at 750 bringing her average price per stock up a bit. Had she done it my way, she'd still have the same amount of shares, but she'd have bought in at 750 using the profit from the short sell.

She then follows my advice with not only Tesla, but a few other stocks, and luck boxes her way into about $300,000 in profits in just under a quarter. her original plan, was to ride out Tesla's up and down's until one day she had a million. She listens to me, and gets a quarter of that in less than 4 months.

We never had an agreement that i'd get any sort of commission for the advice, bc at the time i believed it would've been illegal. what's never illegal, is gifting someone money. She 100% credits me and my advice with this score she made. even going as far as to call me ""Guru"".

Am I the asshole because I think i'm owed at least 2k as a good gesture?

edit: and by bringing her average price per stock up what I mean is that since she took out more money from her ""bank roll"" to buy more stock at 750 (to add to the original 70k she bought at 650) she not only brought her average price per stock up, but she also invested more of her bank roll when she could've re invested just the profits from the first trade she failed to make at 750, thus making her original 70k investment STILL 70k, not whatever it was AFTER she added more stock)  


SUPER EDIT: 2k not 20k. I didn't see I put a zero there and a friend of mine alerted me to this. carry on now

AITA for laughing at someone who said the University of Phoenix is a real college?,"I was talking with a friend of a friend and he mentioned that he was working on his Master's degree. I had gotten my Master's degree awhile back from a state university. TBH, most people who were in my program were people trying to go from entry-level to mid-level or just trying to get their foot in the door in a very competitive industry. But it was worth it. He was telling me how he could relate.

I asked what school he went to because it is hard going to grad school and working full-time. He said his classes were online and I became suspect. I asked him what school he was going to. He said the University of Phoenix. I laughed at him and told him that was not a real school and no one considers it to be reputable. I also pointed out that it costs more money to go to UofP than a state college.

EDIT: No, it's not a ""real"" school. Employers do not take a degree from UofP seriously. Would you want your kid's teacher to have gotten their degree from an paper mill college or a hire lawyer who went to a college that met the bare requirements? 

EDIT 2: Yes, he deserved to be mocked for taking out 15K in loans to get a Master's degree from a sham college. He didn't even research it. That's the kind of people who go to U of P.",Asshole
AITA For not bringing my drunk girlfriend back home?,"Just made an account to see if I was being an asshole about this.

She refused because she wanted to listen to a band that was coming up. She told me that it was okay if I wanted to leave, she can just get an uber. 

I reminded her that she was very drunk and maybe that wasn't such a good idea and she should come with me. She got annoyed and said she is staying. I warned her once again I am leaving and she seemed fine with it, so I made sure she had money and I left.

I get home, and about an hour later I get a call from her telling me she feels very out of it, feels very nauseous and sounded like she was crying and begging me to come get her.

AITA my brothers fiancé is allergic to dogs but I think she’s faking the severity.,"My brothers fiancé is allergic to dogs but I think she’s faking the severity AITA?

To start I Don’t particularly care for my brothers fiancé.  She has a tendency to be over dramatic especially when she’s sick.  My wife and I have a dog that everyone in my family loves and is fine with coming to their homes.  Our dog is well behaved, doesn’t bark and we groom and bath him regularly.  

Here’s where it gets interesting....  My brothers fiancé claims she’s allergic to dogs but fine with hypoallergenic.  Totally get it and wouldn’t wish allergies on anyone.  However I think she’s pretending her allergies are worse than what they actually are because  she doesn’t particularly care for me either.  Now I’m not scientist but she claims even if the dog comes in the house and she’s not in direct contact with it that she’ll have a flair up.  She claims even being in another room will make her have a reaction.  I call BS but I understand severity can differ from one to another.  My brother has completely backed her and they aren’t willing to compromise about letting our dog in the house during holidays.  (It’s my parents house not theirs). I firmly believe we are getting worked  here and it’s put an incredible amount of strain on the family around holidays.  I’ve continued to be the bigger person and not press the issue but it’s difficult to bite my tongue as I see my brothers fiancé living in squalor and living an otherwise unhealthy lifestyle.  Am I the asshole because I truly believe she’s taking advantage of the situation just to inconvenience us?

Also the dog has been in the house multiple times when she’s been there and also when she hasn’t and she’s had zero issue.  She’s overweight has breathing issues from weight but insists our dog contributes to it.  Am o being an insensitive asshole?",Asshole
AITA for cutting my (27F) best friend (27F) of over 12 years out of my life?,"We met each other in school when we were both 15 years old. I was a new kid, having just moved to Oklahoma after living in Germany for the first 15 years of my life. One girl, let's call her Jo, was assigned to help me settle in at school, after all, English wasn't my first language.

We got along really well. The both of us shared a lot of interests: We both were really into video games (especially Pokémon), we liked the same kind of music and tv series, yadda yadda yadda. The moment we met we immediately became best friends, and we've been ever since, until about 4 months ago.

Fast forward 12 years later, we're both 27 years old and are still very good friends, although we've grown a bit apart. (college, work, her becoming a mother etc.)  We both lived in Oklahoma City, not too far away from each other. We would often go out to eat together or invite each other from some coffee, nothing too crazy.

It was a very enjoyable time to be with her, until about 4 months ago. She would often just not show up, even though she agreed to come. When I asked her about it, she ridiculed me. ""Sorry OP, I don't hang out with Nazis"" (She knew I was German). Jo started to text me mean things randomly. Like ""I wonder why I'm still friends with such a fa--ot like you"" or ""How are you, fatty?"". I blocked her several times, but always unblocked her after she came to my home crying about how ""bEsT fRiEnDs ArEn'T sUpPoSeD tO dO tHaT!!!""

After a while things only got worse. She got married to a man who we'll call Bob. Bob was a very tall, athletic man. We got along very well when we first met. But then Jo came in and told all these horrible things about me. (Examples include: ""She tried to have s-x with me"" ""She slept with over 6 people during college"" ""She is actually ok with Naziism and Racism"") None of these things were true, but he believed her. Soon, they both started harassing me. She taught her 5-year-old how to say ni--er and then claimed it was me. After a while, I couldn't handle it anymore. I deleted all social media and created new accounts under a new name. I also changed my phone number.

1 month ago, I moved to Phoenix, Arizona. She doesn't know about this. She has no idea where I am. However, she probably knows I moved. She just doesn't know where.

AITA for sleeping naked at my boyfriend's house? I was expecting privacy.,"My boyfriend and I are temporarily living with his parents right now. We had an apartment but the building had a flood and we didn't have many other options.

His parents didn't want us sleeping in the same room, which was okay, beggars can't be choosers and all. So he got his childhood bedroom and I got the guest room.

I went to bed and didn't wear anything, just because that's what I always do and I wasn't expecting anyone but my boyfriend to be coming in.

I woke up in the morning to the sound of a door slamming shut and voices that I couldn't totally make out because I was so groggy coming from outside the door. I could tell it was my boyfriend's parents and I was a little weirded out. I'd tossed the blankets off my upper body in the night, and that was really awkward to realize they'd walked in on that.

They left the door and I checked the time on my phone, it was super early, and rolled over to go back to sleep. Honestly kind of avoiding the awkwardness.

When I came downstairs later my boyfriend and his mom were in an argument, and I overheard her calling someone a slut. I very quickly realized it was me, and she was saying I had no respect for their home...

That seemed like a total overreaction, I don't think I did anything so weird.

Apparently what had happened was his parents came in to wake me up for breakfast, and were mad about how I was sleeping, thought that was immodest, and were also mad I slept in till almost noon when the household gets up at 7.

Edit to add - My boyfriend said his parents said they knocked first and called through the door but only opened the door when that didn't wake me up. Then they saw me and slammed the door back shut. I'd believe that, I'm a very heavy sleeper

I haven't talked to them directly about it, my boyfriend wanted me to let him handle things because he thinks I'd probably escalate things rather than calm things down.

AITA for not neglecting my brother's cat?,"My little brother got a new cat yesterday with my permission. He locked the new cat in the bathroom claiming it's some sort of introduction thing, only letting it out for an hour while locking the old cat in his bedroom. He'd only let them sniff at each other under the door. My friend has 3 cats, and she says she's never heard of this at all. She told me he's neglecting it, so I let it out while my brother was at work. The cats walked up to each other. They were full on hissing with the ears back and screaming. My friend said to let them work it out, so I did, and they've calmed down but we're avoiding each other.

My brother came home and saw them growling. He freaked out, threw the new cat's toy in the bathroom, and shut the door. He said that he'll probably have to rehome the new cat since I can't ever be expected to follow directions. I told him that my friend said he's neglecting it, and he said that we're both idiots and that there's a reason why experts say cats have to be slowly introduced. I told him that neither of us have ever heard of this, and that I've always been told to let them work it out. I called my friend, and she said that because my brother freaked out, they'll associate each other with negative emotions and never get along.

I told him I don't want him neglecting the poor cat, and he said he'll have to re-home it if I refuse to listen to him. AITA? I'm not okay with animals being neglected just because he watched some guy on YouTube who said that's okay.",Asshole
AITA for accusing my sister of buying fake Instagram followers?,"My older sister lives off of her Instagram. She’s a model. She has 2 public accounts. I check them daily so I know how many Instagram followers she has. Her follower count growth has always been very natural. Her main account had around 135K followers on January 1, 149K followers this morning, and 156K followers when I checked it tonight. Her secondary account she created on January 1 had around 4K followers this morning and over 8K tonight. It’s hilarious because those numbers haven’t jumped up in a few hours. It was a very quick spike in followers and then a plateau. If you click into her followers, the new ones all have bot usernames with 0 followers and follow hundreds of people who I suppose buy followers too. It’s hilarious that my sister would be so stupid. These fake followers won’t drive up her engagement. 


I texted my sister “I see you have bought fake followers on Instagram. They won’t drive up your engagement or do you any good you know? You just look like a phony.” She texted me right back “I didn’t buy any followers.” I texted “sure thing”. She texted “Dude fuck off. I told you I didn’t buy any followers. I honestly don’t know how they got here.” I texted “they’re all bots.” She texted “no shit they’re all bots.” I texted “I’ve never heard of this happening but all the best.” She texted “dude stfu, I didn’t buy shit okay?” I replied with a heart emoji.

AITA for going to the beach with my ex-boyfriend without notifying my current boyfriend first?,"My ex-boyfriend from high school and I broke up on good terms. He was in my city for 4 days to meet some friends and he thought of hitting me up as well today for a late lunch. I had finished my classes for the day but my boyfriend isn’t done until the evening. I texted my boyfriend of 8 months to ask him if I can have lunch with my ex-boyfriend and he said okay. He’s single at the moment. 


He picked me up and we went to a lunch spot by the beach. We had a blast catching up and while I insisted on splitting the bill, his insistence to pay for me was stronger so I gave in. We walked on the promenade and played some games on the pier. He won a stuffed animal and gave it to me. 


After that, he suggested we go lay on the sand on the beach. I didn’t think much of it since I’m not going to be in a bikini anyway. It’s 80 degrees so I just kept my tank top on. He went shirtless. No biggie, he’s just a little buffer than when he was in high school. But it still didn’t spark that attraction into overdrive. We just laid there and talked. 


I made an Instagram story of me and him on the beach. My boyfriend called me not even 10 minutes later asking me wtf I’m doing. I told him that we’re just on the beach doing nothing really. He started to curse me out so I told him I’m handing the phone over to my ex-boyfriend to explain. 


My ex-boyfriend said he’s just hanging out with an old friend he hasn’t seen for over an year. He asked my boyfriend if he would like to have dinner, just the 3 of us, to clear the air and show him that he’s a good guy. Apparently, my boyfriend said fuck no and hung up. I apologized to my ex-boyfriend for getting him into this situation and for my boyfriend’s behavior. 


He has never had a girlfriend before so he’s probably ultra-protective of me, though he doesn’t mind me hanging out with the few guy friends I have, and I don’t mind him hanging out with the few girl friends he has.

WIBTA if I ask my lesbian friend not to come to my party?,"I'm bisexual and my best friend (I'll call her Rosie) of six years is a lesbian. We met in college and lived as roommates until I met my current partner, Paul.

I'll be the first to admit that Rosie has done a much better job of staying connected to the local LGBTQ+ community than I have. When you're in a relationship, it's just easy to turn down opportunities to go out and do things. That's why it meant so much to me when Rosie started hosting a private lesbian-oriented meetup out of her house. The meetups are nothing sexual--mostly it's just a bunch of chicks hanging out, drinking, decompressing, and talking about women. It's my only opportunity to engage in the side of myself that's attracted to women and as such, it really means a lot to me.

This year, I finally decided to try holding a party of my own! Except my party as I envision it will cater to bisexual people from all walks of life! It's the first party/meetup of its kind that I've ever heard of, which makes it kind of a big deal to me. I want it to be a place for people who can all relate to each other, where we can all just be ourselves without having to consider whether we might be stepping on anybody's toes.

The thing is, I REALLY want it to be a space free of monosexual judgment and discomfort. I have a feeling that Rosie will understand, but I also know that there's a possibility she'll bring up a few points in protest.

One is that I do sometimes bring my boy trouble to the girl group. Several of the women there are partnered up and use the group as an ""escape"" where they get to vent about relationship stuff. I need as much advice as anyone--I just happen to be dating a man, but that doesn't make me any less bisexual. Rosie has never complained, but there are one or two women at the group who do look a little Over It when Paul's name comes up. I get it--I should probably find a different place to decompress about my male partner than at a lesbian get-together, but it honestly feels a little insulting to think that I can't be honest about my problems in my own best friend's house.

There were also a couple of instances where I brought Paul along with me to the lesbian group. Group time is way too important to me to give up, and at the time Paul was going through some really rough emotional stuff and I wouldn't have felt right leaving him alone. I did make sure to check with Rosie that it was okay each time, so while I don't think this was ever an issue (of course it would've been if it happened every time) I DO think it's something Rosie might point out when I tell her I'd rather not involve her in the bisexual meetup.

All that said, I really don't want to lose her friendship. She's always been like a sister to me! I just really don't want to sacrifice my vision either.

AITA for making fun (M39) of my daughter (F18) and her social awkwardness?,"Throwaway account since my daughter has Reddit.

Me and my wife (F38) are quite extroverted people and are confident when going out and are quite outgoing people. We thrive well in social events.

Our daughter is an introvert. She likes to stay at home rather than go out. She prefers to study and do her indoor hobbies (like piano playing, knitting reading drawing etc) In so many ways she’s very different from us - she’s more academically driven and career orientated. When me and her mother were in high school we went out partying a lot and didn’t focus on our academics.

She spent all of quarantine studying and making five-year plans with strict timetables. It’s something I’m not that accepting of as she’s still young and she should be going out and having fun. But she claims what she does is fun for her and she doesn’t want to deal with the teenage drama anymore as she’s an adult.

She doesn’t really have social media or posts anything except for on Reddit as she feels comfortable no one knowing who she is and she can place her opinions and thoughts on here.

She is also very socially awkward..she is very shy and timid and has low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in herself. I know she’s a very smart and talented young woman as well but she isn’t reaching that potential.

She also isn’t as emotionally open to people and doesn’t like to cry or show her anger - she’s generally a bubbly person. She’s got a facade on and doesn’t like to show when she isn’t okay and it’s something that really worries’s my wife. Even in public she refuses to eat meals and gets too nervous eating in front of other people and often eats dinner in her room.

She doesn’t like to go out unless with her friends that she’s comfortable being around. And even then at times if she isn’t ‘feeling like it’ she’ll decline. She has said numerous times that she dislikes going out because she feels like people are judging her - she’s often been harassed when she’s gone out so that deflated her social confidence of going out more. Recently she was padded down at a shop (as she is of colour) and gets followed around by people a lot. During high school, she was bullied a lot and physically hit by her ‘friends’ and they caused her all sorts of trouble. She doesn’t like to associate with people who don’t share similar morals and values as her anymore.

Her close friends are extroverts and her boyfriend is an introvert himself. I told her that she could at least have dated someone that’s an extrovert to at least help with confidence skills. But she said she was comfortable with him and felt that she didn’t have to change herself and he was accepting of her being socially awkward. She said he takes charge when ordering food or talking to strangers and always holds her hand whenever she gets too nervous as reassurance. Her friends also know that her social battery gets really low quickly and they always make her comfortable - to the point where she can comfortably eat with her friends and boyfriend now. (Took her around six years)

When at shops I’ve forced her to talk to the people around us and she gets too nervous and begins to stutter and ramble. I often make fun of her talking awkwardly and she gets upset. Some times I’ve yelled at her and left her crying. One time she was really stressed out with exams coming up (her first semester at uni) so I offered to go out to lunch with her when I was on my lunch break. She met up with me and once again I told her to order and actually try without being nervous. Once again she stuttered and was getting really nervous and out of frustration I told her off. I said it wasn’t hard to speak in front of others and that no one is judging her and she is 18 and needs to get over it. She started to cry and then left saying that I wasn’t understanding or patient and by forcing her to do something she was beginning to resent going out with me more.

She told my wife and she was angry at me. She is constantly babying her by helping her little by little go out. And I disagree with it. My wife has told me that our daughter deals with things differently from us and that I should be more understanding of her situation and help her in ways that make her comfortable not in ways that make me comfortable. She’s an introvert and we have to accept that and not just throw her into social situations where she’s uncomfortable. For years as well she had a teddy that came EVERYWHERE because it made her feel safe luckily that ended before she started high school.

So AITA in this situation?

Ordinarily this would not be a problem, but since my wife is in the wedding party, I am concerned about photos being taken of me and of me being tagged on social media and my family being able to see it. If this gets seen, I am going to get a lot of grief and questions from my family which I don't want to deal with. 

Of course my wife expects me to go even though I have explained to her this is going to open up a lot of uncomfortable family conversations which she won't have to deal with but I will. I am at the point now where I have to make a decision since my wife is not giving me an easy out. 

I know that this may be the cowardly approach, but I have considered skipping the wedding and lying and saying I came down with the flu. I do not know if my wife would lie on my behalf, but we'll see.

i don’t remember what they said after that  because i was sobbing so hard. all i remember is that i had trouble breathing so my dad hugged me and comforted me until i could calm down a bit.

AITA for talking about how hot the flight attendant was on the plane?,"I (23M) was on a 12 hour flight with my brother (26M). He was in the aisle seat. I was next to him in the middle seat. There was a woman around 30 next to me in the window seat. I greeted the woman when she sat down next to me. Shortly before taking off, a very beautiful flight attendant told me to stow my backpack underneath my seat. 


I told my brother she was so hot. He said he didn’t pay attention. It’s understandable since he’s engaged. I pointed at the flight attendant I was talking about and said she’s a 10. My brother said she’s pretty. I jokingly asked him if I should ask her out. He jokingly dared me to try. Obviously I wasn’t going to. 


I know that flight attendant uniforms don’t show off the bust too well, but there was something different there about the hot flight attendant. I don’t know if my mind was playing tricks on me, but it looked like her boobs protruded further out than those of the other flight attendants while she also looked to be the slimmest of them all. 


Because of all that, I whispered to my brother to check out her rack. He just shook his head and called me a kid. I told him to take a look and ask me if he thought they were real or fake. The woman next to me heard and knew what I was talking about. She said that was an inappropriate conversation to have on the plane with the flight attendant present and a child sitting behind me. 


I apologized and told her I’ll keep the volume down. She said I shouldn’t have this conversation on the plane at all. I turned to my brother and loudly whispered in his ear that she’s such a bitch. I intended for her to hear me. She did. She said she’s going to be a bigger bitch when she tells the flight attendant what we were talking about. I rolled me eyes. 


When the flight attendant walked by us again, the woman next to me told her that my brother and I were loudly discussing her boobs. I felt embarrassed. The flight attendant told us to please stop. My brother said it was just me talking about them and he was forced to listen. I apologized to her and she said that it was alright and walked down the aisle. 


The woman next to me called me pathetic. I didn’t say another word to her for the rest of the flight. I was surprised she didn’t have to get up to use the lavatory either. It was awkward every time the hot flight attendant asked me what I wanted to eat or drink. 


After the flight, my brother said that was not the right place to discuss the flight attendant’s boobs or even how hot she was. He said he was extremely embarrassed even before the woman next to me started the scene. I’m not halfway convinced I was out of line. I was having a bro talk at an appropriate volume, but the woman next to me just had to ruin the flight for us.",Asshole
AITA for not accepting my niece's gift?,"Throwaway since my niece probably uses Reddit.

My husband's family does a Secret Santa gift exchange every year, with every adult (his siblings and their spouses, and their adult children) getting the name of another adult to purchase a gift for. We did our gift exchange early this year because it's the only time we can all get together until later January and we figured early was better than late.

We all sent out our wishlists; I asked for clothes and gift cards to a couple of boutiques I like. We did the gift exchange as usual and it turned out my niece (26F) got me. She handed me a card with a short message and a $50 gift card inside, which was kind of underwhelming ($50 is our minimum gifting limit, our family is quite well-off though I understand she personally is having financial issues) but sweet. She told me to wait and that she had another gift, and presented me with a pretty gift bag full of homemade double-chocolate cookies.

The problem here was that I'm a very healthy eater. I don't eat dessert almost ever, except for occasionally frozen yogurt, and I certainly don't eat cookies. My niece told me that she used a special recipe using whole wheat flour and honey and such to make them more healthful, but that doesn't matter to me. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, so I suggested that instead we could all share the cookies as a family. She agreed to that. I tried a little piece because she was clearly waiting for me to do so and I told her they were good, which they were, but I'm glad I didn't accept them as they would have ruined my meal plan.

I thought everything had gone well until today, when my sister-in-law (my niece's mother) called my husband to complain that I had been rude, and that if I didn't want the cookies I could have just accepted them and let my husband and kids have them once we'd gotten home. She says my niece felt guilty that she couldn't afford more off of my wishlist and wanted to make something else to make up for it. I understand how she feels, but honestly it would have been less awkward for both of us if she hadn't done so. She knows about my dietary preferences, so I don't understand why she did this.

AITA for not taking the cookies?

Edit: Since so many of you think I should have taken them home to my kids: why do you think it's a better idea for me to fill them with unhealthy food than to eat it myself? My husband is an adult and he can make his own choices, but my kids are 12 and 10 and I wouldn't let them eat more than one of these cookies in a day.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting my ex-husband to keep wearing his wedding suit to events with his new gf?,"**UPDATE:** My ex texted me back (no, I did not bother about him besides the first mention of it) and said that after thinking about it, he agrees that it was weird and he had just literally not thought about it because he was just used to wearing the suit every time he needed a suit. He said if I was wearing my wedding dress or ring out on dates he'd feel bummed about it. His girlfriend didn't know about the embroidery and I doubt he'll tell her, haha.   


Just because a marriage is over doesn't mean the time two people spent together is meaningless - we both still have a lot of respect for each other and are glad the relationship happened, and I don't think either of us is interested in shitting on or discarding the good memories of our wedding day. We're not the ""cut the ex out of photos and burn it"" types and our separation was extremely civil (except for my growing resentment about being left with the workload.) But, if these comments are any indication, that level of sentimentality is uncommon, haha.   


(As far as that workload, he's still saying he'll try to come deal with what's left of it but is super busy. He's a major workaholic which is part of the reason we ended up separated - he also moved about 40 min away and is just kind of flaky, so, I'm not holding my breath, haha.) 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  


Backstory: Been divorced about two years, after five years married and about 10 together. Both our faults, but no cheating or anything crazy.

Recently I found out that my ex has been wearing the suit he had custom made for our wedding to other events (other weddings, fancy dinners, etc) with his new girlfriend. I asked if he would, y'know, maybe get a new suit instead.

His argument: It was an expensive custom made suit that he invested in expecting to have it for the rest of his life.

My arguments:

* I paid even more for my wedding dress and I'm not certainly wearing THAT again
* The suit literally has our names and wedding date embroidered inside of it. If I was the new GF that would make me feel weird as hell (and as the ex... it makes me feel weird as hell. It's like him wearing his wedding band out on dates.)
* Since it was a custom-designed suit, we literally sat down and picked out the fabric (and cut, and detailing) together. (And he's not very savvy with clothes so he leaned on me pretty heavily. I basically designed the damn thing.)
* Theoretically he was also expecting *to be married* the rest of his life but sometimes shit doesn't work out, bud

He's not so hard-up that he can't afford a new suit (though I'll admit he probably wouldn't get one as fancy), and he did get five solid years of wear out of it while we were married (and never had it cleaned once, btw. I finally took it in when the collar turned yellow.) So it's not like it was a total waste of money or anything.

I don't know what the girlfriend thinks or if she's even noticed it... if my current boyfriend had another girl's name and their wedding date in his suit I'd be asking him to get the stitching removed at a minimum, and would probably just take him suit shopping. I'm not one of those people who thinks you have to throw away everything an ex ever touched, but wedding clothes are...kind of a major thing?

Also kind of contributing: he basically pranced away from our marriage with zero baggage or responsibility. I bought him out of the house (he didn't want it) and took on our dogs and all their expenses (he didn't want them either). I'm still dealing with getting rid of his parents' old furniture in the basement, which he didn't so much as help me clean or sort- I had to divide up every single artifact of our relationship myself and deliver him his stuff in bins. I got stuck dealing with all the love letters and cards and wedding photos and other emotionally-fraught crap. So it's kinda like... you didn't want to deal with your share of the unpleasant stuff, but you still want to keep the one leftover that makes you look good? Hmm.

Ultimately I know it doesn't matter and I can't control what he does (I'm not really going to try, beyond having made the request once) I just feel like it's a dick move and am wondering if I'm ridiculous for thinking that or not.

EDIT: Like I said, **I know it doesn't really matter and I'm not going to bring it up a second time because I can't control what he does.** I made the request once and he can do what he will with it. Just wanted to know if I was nuts for thinking it's an awkward thing to do.",Asshole
AITA for telling this guy asking for donations to fuck off,"There's this guy standing outside my work everyday asking for donations for veterans. He stands near the only stairs up and it's basically impossible to avoid him. He's been asking me (not just me obv) for weeks to donate for veterans, but veterans don't deserve donations so I tell him no. But it's grating having to walk past this guy every day and answer the same question, sometimes twice. So today as I was walking home for lunch, already pissed from work, when he asked me for a donation I told him (kind of loudly) ""How many times do you have to ask me this question? No. You and your vets can fuck off."" He seemed really pissed and like he was going to say something, but I just kept walking. I didn't feel bad, but some people on the street gave me nasty looks.

AITA at the bus stop," When I take the bus home I like to listen to podcasts or radio plays so I'm not really paying attention to the people around me.

So there I am sitting of the bench waiting for the bus looking at reddit and this lady comes up and stands off to the side. A couple of minutes go by and I notice her saying ""Excuse me?"" I don't respond because I'm tired and don't feel like talking.

She stops but then a dozen seconds later I notice in my periphery the lady swinging her bag back and forth trying to get me to notice her and then she hits the bench with her bag to make it vibrate in a attempt to make me look up. I don't.

Another minute goes by and she decides to tap me on the shoulder so I fake jump a little to act like she startled me and remove a headphone.

Buslady: Can I ask you something?

Me: I have my headphones on clearly I don't want to talk

Buslady: But I have a question?

I put my headphones back on and wait for the bus to get there.

I feel like it's worth noting that we have been taking the bus at the same time for years (when the road was under construction for a while we walked to the next busy stop at the same time) and she has never once tried to talk to me.

She probably wanted to ask when the next bus is or how long I've been waiting, that's what everyone asks.",Asshole
AITA for not selling cigarettes to a pregnant woman?,"So I work at a gas station graveyard shift and there's been this one lady that time me off for the simple reason she always pays for junk food and drinks with EBT food card, but always has money for cigarettes.

She's been pregnant for maybe 4-5 months now and she does this about half of the time, buys a soda and a bag of chips with food stamps pulls out a 20 and buys cigarettes, personally it pisses me off, she has a better car then me and she has food stamps but when I applied I got flat out rejected.

Regardless this time I was having a bad night and when she asked for her regular camel crush cigarettes I told her straight up, she obviously doesn't need them she has food stamps and she shouldn't even be fucking smoking and to think about her child, she left pissed off while we were cussing at each other a bit nothing to harsh.

Next morning I tell my coworker about it and she said I might have crossed the line and it's none of my business to begin with and in a way ig she's right, what do you guys think? AITA?

Update: a few things I'd like to say that I'm really not okay with, sure it's her body I get it I understand, doesn't mean it's right at all what she's doing

Second: I do in fact know she's pregnant I've asked.

Third: the cigarettes were in fact for her I also asked her that, she said they were for her.

Fourth and last: sure people can say it's non of my business but honestly when I see grown ass woman smoking without any regards for the health of her unborn child it just makes me sick, she should worry about the fucking life she has growing inside of her not her addictions, and the food stamps I brought up because she clearly doesn't need them, people that actually need them get denied the help for to many people having food stamps such as this lady.

"AITA For Disliking Americans, Moving Further Away When I Hear Them, Or Avoiding Them In General?","Okay, context.

AITA for kicking my mom out of my house for bringing non-vegan wine to my vegan Christmas dinner?,"My wife and I have a tradition of hosting a vegan Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner each year for our vegan and vegetarian friends. We live in an area where such a thing is seen by many people with ridicule and contempt, so we want to be able to let our friends and ourselves enjoy a proper Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.

My mom asked me if she could come to our Thanksgiving dinner this year since she now lives alone, so I of course said yes. She asked us to make some turkey, and I told her no because everybody else at the dinner will be vegan or vegetarian, and so we will be keeping it vegan.

On Thanksgiving day, she decided to show up several hours early and *bring with her a turkey, which she said that she was going to bake in our oven*. We said absolutely not, and that we do not want any meat in our house. She had to bring the turkey back to her house and come back for dinner. During the dinner, she started whining about the food and making bizarre remarks about veganism in general, making everybody else uncomfortable. I pulled her aside to another room during the dinner, telling her that she needs to be more respectful. The rest of the dinner went fine after that.

She asked to come to our Christmas dinner as well, so I told her to please *not* bring any food or drink. She disregarded my request and decided to bring a bottle of wine. I looked up that particular wine on Barnivore, *only to find out that the wine is not vegan*. I told her to please leave, and that she will not be invited back anytime soon.

She was very upset and apologetic, telling me that she did not know that there was such a thing as non-vegan wine. I do believe her; however this was her second chance and she disregarded my *very simple request* to not bring *any* food or drink.

AITA for telling my sister to get over her dumb fear?,"So my (m15) sister (f18) got stuck in an elevator last December. She was going outside from a parking hall that was really empty and it was pretty late, so she had to wait a while (almost an hour) before some people came to help her out. 

Ever since then she's been very scared to take elevators and takes the stairs instead anytime she can. I think that's ridiculous, because it's been a long time since she got stuck and she wasn't even stuck for that long. I think it's annoying and stupid to use the stairs and make others wait. 

Last night we were all going to a restaurant to celebrate our dad's 50th birthday. We parked in a parking hall headed to the elevator. She said she's taking the stairs and I said ""You know it's so annoying when we have to wait for you."" And she said ""it's not for long, we're only 4 floors down."" And then I kind of raised my voice and said something along the lines of ""If it's such a short time why can't you take the elevator? You act like you have PTSD just get over yourself."" 

She then called me an idiot and went to the staircase. In the elevator my parents said I was being mean and not to talk like that again. I think I was justified because she's basically an adult and being such a coward it's getting on my nerves.

AITA for commenting “nice pecs” on a fitness model’s Instagram post?,"I’m 22M. I’m single at the moment, but I’ve been making dumb comments on Instagram for attention even when I had a girlfriend.

The first thing I do upon waking up is to check Instagram. Since my brain was still fuzzy, I forgot to switch accounts today before I commented on a fitness model’s Instagram post.

She said that was disgusting and didn’t know I was like that. Of course I didn’t tell her about the comments I made with my other accounts, so I told her I was a little hung over and thought to crack a joke. She said that was super inappropriate.

WIBTA For Pawning the Diamond Jewelry my Grandfather Bought Me for Christmas?,"So, let me put this into context. I come from an upper class family. We are inherently really rich, and due to my mother’s past experiences in the military, the first four years of college are payed for by the government’s expense. Sounds like a life in heaven right? Wrong. Our family’s incomes stem from old money, and that would be fine if the money wasn’t dangling in front of me my whole life. Everything in my family is about looks and outer appearances. By age five I was expected to know how to set a table, and how to hold a red wine vs a white wine. I am an only child, so challenges like this were exceedingly harder and more cruel than normal lessons. Let’s just say that I never really had a childhood. Recently, I’ve become to realize just what negativity stems from having to rely soulfully on other’s money, and not your own. As I’ve matured in years, there are things I wish to see and buy that are against my family’s wishes. For example, unlike other teenagers who get to wear all stars and go to grunge concerts, I must dress in pretty tailored outfits, and only attend concerts held at the U.S. Capitol or Broad Ways written before 1950. Not exactly the life of a 18 year old girl. 

    I have noticed that I have a lot of opportunities to attend these events from other friends, but since I am not allowed to get a job until I complete college, and not allowed to withdraw money from my savings, nor allowed to ask for money, I can never afford tickets, or clothes, or parts for my room or car or to get on a plain to visit colleges. Sometimes I would prefer to walk the streets looking like an 18 year old girl, and not my mother’s dress up doll. So, I came up with this idea to get the money I need for events, such as expense for a trip I am taking to Japan for studies. My parents are willing to pay money for food and housing, but I really love Japanese culture, and really would appreciate buying from the thrift stores there. 

    The idea is the title, I am thinking of secretly pawning a bunch of old diamond Christmas gifts to live a simpler life. I’m not using the money on materialistic shit such as LV and Gucci, I hate flaunting wealth, I just want money to live out the only year I have left, and pretty much the only year I have, to be a teenager.

AITA for refusing to get a job?,"I (19m) live in the ""guest house"" behind my father's (54m) house. My girlfriend (18f) lives with me. My dad does not charge us rent, and we do not pay for any utilities except cable/wifi. This will be my (hopefully our) home until my dad passes away, at which time I will inherit the main house. 

As my username implies, I come from a wealthy family. My dad is **loaded**, not Gates or Bezos level, but his net worth is in the 8 figure range.  

I have a trust fund, set up by my dad and his lawyers. It pays me out more money than I can reasonably spend. I do not need any more money. When my dad retires, I will be put in charge of his businesses. This will happen by the time I am 35

Here is the problem: 

My girlfriend did not come from money. She is envious of the fact that she has to work while I do not. I legit spend my time goofing off in online video games, and going on vacations to ""see the world"". She works ~30 hours a week to pay for school. 

Recently she suggested that I should get a job. She wants me to **earn** money in addition to the money I get from my fund. But my trust fund provides more than her job does already, so I feel like I am **MORE THAN** pulling my weight.

AITA for telling some little kids the honest truth about marijuana?,"I was at the youth center a few days ago. It's open for any kid in grades K-12, and I go there maybe one or two times a week.

Anyway, some little kids had just gone through some drug prevention thing at school, and apparently they'd be told all the cliche bullshit about weed that cops and the government like to spread around. 

I didn't like seeing them get lied to like that, so I laid the facts on them, including:
1. Weed has never killed a human being ever in all of history, and human beings have been growing weed for over 8,000 years.
2. Weed is only illegal because the government makes way too much easy money putting harmless, non-psychotic people in jail, and so cops can have easy and less dangerous work days and feel more powerful doing exactly that.
3. Smoking weed has been proven to be healthier for you than drinking alcohol, and how many of your older relatives/friends drink without any trouble?
4. Most people who try smoking weed don't even keep on smoking weed afterwards, much less switch to ice or heroin, which actually are addictive and deadly.
5. Weed doesn't make you act violent or go crazy, it just relaxes your mind and makes you happy and hungry.
6. Because of operation green harvest in the 80s, when cops in helicopters would raid and burn down herb fields here in Hawaii, everybody started turning to ice because weed was so scarce, and we still have one of, if not the highest rate of ice use across the nation.
7. Weed still shouldn't be smoked by little kids cause they can't handle being high yet, and high school kids could maybe use it on rare occasions, after all school work is finished.
8. A lot of people actually take tolerance breaks for weed, where they don't smoke for weeks or even months so that they can get a better high when they eventually do decide to smoke. Would anyone actually do that with a drug that made you super hooked like ice?

Anyway, after I finished telling them all that, one of the workers started scolding me (not yelling by any means), and gave me a warning about how I was talking and could get a write up. I didn't wanna risk that or get into a fight anyway, so I just went to go do something else.

AITA for calling up a mom the day before her son's Bar Mitzvah and telling her to invite my daughter?,"My daughter is 13 and attends a relatively small middle school with only ~50 kids in her grade. Everyone in the grade knows each other well, and for the most part all the parents know each other too. It just so happens based on the area that the school is in that almost half of the kids in the school are Jewish. So a lot of these kids are having Bar/Bat Mitzvah parties, and so far everyone that had a party has invited the entire grade. 

My daughter is socially awkward and does not really have friends. She's a very sweet kid, but extremely shy and I've heard that it comes off as her thinking she is smarter than other people (I don't see it, but that's what I've heard). A boy had his bar Mitzvah this past Saturday, and the day before I heard that he invited *literally* every kid in the grade except for a notorious bully and my daughter. I was furious and upset. 

I let myself calm down before calling his mother, and she was clearly uncomfortable over the phone and just said that she let her son choose the guest list. I said that I could understand that even if he was inviting 40 out of 50 kids, but to just exclude two is cruel. Especially since my daughter is certainly not a bully. She did seem to feel bad but wasn't making any move to do anything about it. 

So I said ""I'm planning to bring my daughter to the party tomorrow, is that okay?"" She responded that they can't add another person the day before the party. I said that they invited over 200 people (including family, family friends, and non-school friends) and they can fit one more person, especially since at least one person won't show up. She ultimately agreed, and I ended up taking my daughter.

Nobody knows, including my daughter, what I did, so it's not like the kids at school know and I embarrassed her (as long as the other mother didn't tell people). I feel bad for making the ""demand"" the day before the party, but that's when I found out. I knew my daughter would be crushed after the party if she found out everyone else was invited.

So me and my friend were hanging out the other day and he asked me what music I listen to. I started playing ‘Minorities in my waterpark’ as a joke and started singing along. Now he thinks I’m a racist and refuses to hang out with me. I told him it was a joke but he won’t listen. I think I might have ruined our friendship. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for telling my step son’s dad that I’m more of a father to his son than he is?,"I’m step dad to an 8yo. His dad sees him quite a bit, taking him to school 3 times a week and collecting him twice a week - they hang out together after school and do projects together. He has his son at his place every other weekend - some 35miles away, as he has a family with his partner.

The thing is, I see so much more of his son than he does. I cook for him. Take him to his sports classes when his mum (my wife) is working. I feel like I’m more of a father to my step son than his own dad is. Put the amount of time I’m around him next to how much time his dad spends with him and I do so much more.

The dad does love his son a lot, they are really close and he drives around 1000 miles a month to take him to school, then be there for his other kids too. To be fair to him, the dad does get me a gift every year on Father’s Day to thank me for what I do for his boy.

But, i was upset at him for bringing back late after school and told him to be more responsible and that I was more of a father than he was, because of the reasons I gave.

He looked angry but didn’t say anything. My wife said I shouldn’t have said anything but I feel like I need to tell the truth about how I feel after all that I do and the time I spend with him.

AITA: Requested UBER Refund,"UBER ride home from the airport on Sunday night and the driver's ""flat tire"" light comes on as we're driving down the expressway. We stopped about three blocks from my final destination and he filled his tire with air and proceeded to take me home. Total additional time for the tire-air stop was 15 minutes tops. Driver was very polite and apologetic—but I requested a full-refund from UBER when I got home and it was approved. I made a point to mention the driver's courtesy but I did say it was an ""inconvenience"". Am I whining? Or was this a legitimate request for a refund?",Asshole
AITA the asshole for being blunt with my gf to save her hurt down the line?,"My gf finished an intense grad program in May. For two years, her closest friends were in her cohort and were a mixed gender group with three women (including her) and four men. When the program finished, the two other women and one man accepted jobs in other states and moved away, leaving a friend group that is my GF and three guys who we will call Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

Since her friends moved, she still hangs out with those three regularly just as she hung out with the group before, and they have a group text and are all pretty close. Still she's been trying to find new girlfriends to hang out with and recently met a woman named Sarah who comes with a husband named Isaac.

The problem started when she tried to integrate the groups. The guys liked Sarah fine but none of them liked Isaac because they thought he was 'a bro' or 'a douche.' My gf was stressing about it because she really wanted Sarah to be part of her 'group.' I've met Isaac and I think he's fine, so I explained to my gf what's really going on: chances are, Matthew, Mark, and Luke want to sleep with her (my gf) and they don't want another guy around competing.

My gf's feelings were really hurt and she insisted that all three of them were just friends and that nothing has changed, and that none of them have ever been inappropriate with her and hit on her. She doesn't love Isaac either but she doesn't dislike him like they do but says she can see why they don't like him. Still, this is basically how guys work. We don't really have girl 'friends,' especially not super pretty girls. They most likely either have crushes or at least would sleep with her if she asked.

My gf's feelings are really hurt by this but I don't want her to get her hopes up or pin her hopes on three single guys that they are going to continue to be good friends with her. AITA for telling her how things most likely are?",Asshole
AITA for telling my friend that she shouldn’t feel too sad about her sick puppy since she hasn’t had him that long?,"Throwaway because my friends know my username. 

My best friend (V) just got her four month old puppy three months ago. This is her first time having a pet, so she is a little overprotective of him and would worry over the littlest things that could harm him. However, there is no doubt that she loves him and cares for him and will do anything for him. She also just seemed to be so much happier once she got him. 

A few of weeks ago, the puppy got really sick. I’m not really sure with what, I was never told what it was but he became very lethargic and wasn’t playful, vomiting/diarrhea, not eating/drinking water. And the vets weren’t really sure what was going on and if he’d make it. She was devastated and started blaming herself. She began getting anxious and worried and said she doesn’t know what she would do if she lost him and I could tell she wanted to cry. 

I told her that thankfully, she hasn’t had him for that long and if the worst were to happen to him, she will be able to move on quicker. I reminded her that I lost my dog of over 10 years a little over a month ago and that I am still dealing with that, so hopefully she can find comfort in knowing that she can recover more quickly than I have because she hasn’t had him that long. She kind of just shrugged and said “yeah, maybe” and that she had to go. 

I hadn’t really heard from V after that for a couple of days and asked another friend of ours if she had spoken or heard from her. Thankfully, the puppy has made a full turnaround and is slowly getting back to his playful self, but right now V is a little hurt by the comment I made. I thought it was silly and I was only trying to make her feel better. Our mutual friend told me my comment is insensitive to say to anyone, but especially V because of how good the puppy has been for her (she’s been struggling with PTSD and depression). 

I just feel like V totally took my comment out of context or misinterpreted what I was saying. This whole thing is kind of stupid and if they would just let me explain what I meant then they would realize that she was upset over nothing. 

Did my friend overreact or am I actually the jerk here?",Asshole
AITA for not telling my girlfriend that I have a child somewhere out there?,"Me and my gf have been fighting for the past two days.

In a moment of rage I admitted something to her that I haven't told her before, because I knew it would piss her off.

Me and my ex girlfriend had a child by accident. I know it sounds shitty but I ghosted her a few months after the birth because I realized I was in no position to care for a child and couldn't sacrifice my 20s for something like that. I had a lot on my plate with supporting my family and parents and was already working multiple jobs and was struggling to help support a kid on top of that. It was my only choice otherwise I would've broke.

I ended up meeting my current gf 2 years later and never told her that I had a child out there. Well we were fighting over something stupid yesterday and I told her I was going to leave her for my ex and go back to my family and child. I was obviously not being serious but this pissed her off so much and she went psycho calling me a liar and shit. 

I believe I don't need to tell someone I have a child if that child is literally no longer in my life..

Anyways she and her whole family are calling me an AH and keep throwing this into my face. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for “not supporting” my Girlfriend exercising?,"So to paint a picture of my girlfriend, a lot of her hobbies aren’t physical in nature, one of them being gaming. She is lazy (her words, she knows it) does not exercise at all and has said she wants to get better but doesn’t have any motivation to work out (she hates it). So of course when Nintendo announces a dumb exercise game (Ring Fit Adventure), she got so excited. Saying how this could really be a game changer for her blah blah blah.

A few weeks ago she went out and wastes a whopping $80 on this gimmicky crap. she has actually been playing this game every single day despite disliking physical activities. while I’m happy she is having fun, she’s just falling for bullshit claims that playing a video game will make you fit. I say this as someone who works out myself (for real), I haven’t played/seen a lot of the game but I mean really? You can’t be serious, dropping $80 to play an expensive “fitness game” is crazy when you can go out side and jog for free (which is probably more of a workout this game will ever give).

I haven’t said any of this in a mean way. i have only tried to lower her expectations a bit, saying that she’s not gonna get any results from this game. I’ve tried to convince her to come to the gym with me and get some real exercise, our local gym has a two person membership deal so it would be perfect for us. She doesn’t like any of this. She’s upset with me for “criticizing her” and not supporting the fact she’s getting the most exercise she’s had in years, because of this game. I DO support that she work towards a healthy life style, that’s great! But that’s precisely why I’m critical of this, this game isn’t going to do her any good and I’m just trying to encourage her to do something that will actually benefit her. 

She won’t listen to me (the one who actually works out 3x a week🤦‍♂️) and all she wants is my support, despite this whole thing obviously just being a big gimmicky scam. AITA?",Asshole
"AITA for refusing a student an extension on a paper, despite her learning disability?","I am a neurobiology professor at a large, well-known university. While it is not exclusive, it is known for its very high academic standards, and degrees from here are very attractive to employers. 

In my upper year course this semester, there is a young woman that has repeatedly asked for extensions on assignments. Since it is a small class, I know each student, and she is the student that has shown me the least promise. She is late for class, misses class far too frequently, very rarely participates, and when she is called upon she rarely has anything insightful to add to the conversation. Her grades are mostly C's. 

She has a recommendation from our disability services office to be allowed extra time on assignments and exams due to a supposed learning disability. If she has a disability though, I do not think she needs these accommodations as much as she says she does. I honestly think she's just lazy, unmotivated, and not very bright. It is not difficult to obtain a disability note from a doctor. And every time she emails to ask for the extension, she reminds me the note exists. No, I do not know the details of her disability, just that her doctor says she has one. 

On her most recent paper, she asked for an extension four days before it was due. I denied it, and on the due date she submitted her paper, unfinished. A week later she dropped the course. Apparently she complained to the head of the department, because he wants to meet with me this week. 

I don't know how she has told it, but was what I did so wrong? I don't think she should receive special treatment when she's never shown to deserve it. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to get a vasectomy?,"Basically the title. My (24F) boyfriend (25M) have been together for 4 years, and have starting getting serious about the possibility of marriage and all that stuff. When the subject of children came up I said I would be open to have a few some day when we're both financially stable (I work a minimum wage retail job and he's a cook making decent money). However, he declared fervently that he was never going to have any. The way he just came out and said it made me feel really weird because it was like he didn't seem conflicted at all from what I just said. I sort of let the conversation go elsewhere while secreting hoping that we could talk it over later and that he become more sympathetic to my wishes.


Fast forward to this morning when I found a printout of instructions from a clinic on preparing for a vasectomy procedure. I immediately confront him about this and he said that he forgot to tell me that he's getting a vasectomy next week. I immediately flipped out and demanded to know why he didn't think it was important to discuss this with me. He said it was his body and his decision, and to which I said yea ok but you really haven't considered my needs at all in this. I told him that getting irreversable surgeries like vasectomies are incredibly irresponsible since he'll never know if he'll change his mind about it and that he was being an impulsive child. He said that since he and I are both environmentally conscious we should be against having kids but that I just hadn't 'come around to realizing it yet', which made me really go WTF. I basically told him that if he was really going to go through with this then we were over since he making a life changing decision that would affect our relationship forever and stormed out.


Since then my friends and family have been arguing back and forth about this on FB about this and I'm starting to feel bad about what I said. AITA?",Asshole
"AITA for not giving my ""extra"" money to my coworker?","I'm a 42M who works in a small legal office.   Due to trials being slowed down during our state shutdown, all of us were furloughed and the office was shut down. Now that restrictions have loosed, the office has opened back up, and we are getting back to work with some social distancing. While we all struggled with the lack of wages in our office, I was probably a little bit better off than many of my coworkers. Unlike most of them, I am not married, am not seeing anybody, and do not have kids. I have paid off my student loans, and live well below my means. My hope is to save as much money as possible so that I can retire early, and I think I am on that path.  

Earlier today, one of my coworkers \[32F\], a single mother, approached me and asked if I could give her some money. I know she has 3 kids, and that she was probably more affected by the shutdown than I was. I don't feel comfortable giving my money away, so my initial response was to politely decline. I told her that she should ask our boss to see if he could give her a raise. She got mad, saying that I knew ""darn well"" that the boss wasn't going to give her a raise. She said ""I don't know why you even need the money. You live by yourself in a dank apartment. Some of us have a real life and have actual needs."" I got really upset and told her that her kids are her problem, not mine, and if she couldn't take care of them, maybe she shouldn't have had them. I also said that while I don't have kids right now, maybe I will have a family some day, and I have the right to save my money for that. She got even angrier and said ""Well, I don't think anybody is ever going to want your ugly, stingy ass anyways"" and stalked off. Some of my friends at work later confronted me and said that I should have just given her some money, but I think that's absurd. I don't see why I should work and pass of my money to someone else, especially if that person is rude to me and treats me so poorly. I asked them why they don't just give her their money if they're so concerned, and they said that they have kids and families too, so the shutdown was also hard on them. I feel bad for her somewhat, but I think she was a massive asshole and that I don't owe her anything. AITA for not giving my money away to a coworker who ""needs"" it more than I do?",Asshole
AITA for wanting to skip out on my sister's wedding because I'm afraid I'll outshine her?,"My sister's a very jealous person. Growing up, it wasn't the biggest deal because I was the black sheep of the family and she was my mother's golden child. But as I got older, I learned to embrace the things that made me awkward or different and I started flourishing in a lot of areas that I know she's still insecure about. I've been lucky to have found success as an artist, whereas she's still fighting for her big break (she's a digital artist and I'm in theatre, so there's not enough overlap for me to give her a leg up or anything). I have a very unique look, so even though I'm not especially attractive I definitely stand out in a crowd, while she's more conventional looking. I have a really beautiful life that has allowed me to accomplish some impressive stuff, and I know she resents me for achieving more than me when she always thought that it would've been the other way around.

I've already gotten a lot of flack for things involving her wedding, one of which being how little I've contributed to it financially (I'm not wealthy, but my partner is a more notable actor and has quite a bit of money - they don't know my family very well though). But I'm not particularly close with my sister, and I've gotten burned in the past when I tried to give expensive gifts for Christmas or birthdays and unintentionally made other people look bad. I think that both my sister and my mother have taken my avoidance of the wedding as a personal offense, even though I was trying to stay out of it so that the wedding could be about my sister and not me.

I'm hyperaware of the fact that I attract a lot of attention because of the way that I look or the stories I tell about my life or the friends that I have. I'm pretty good at managing it and keeping myself humble, but I feel like this time it's gotten me stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't really dress myself up for events, but if I dress normally they'll accuse me of not caring or being intentionally sloppy for the wedding. If I do, my sister will pitch a fit about how I'm trying to upstage her or show off my money. If I bring my partner to the wedding, chances are that they'll be recognized and the wedding will become a lot less about her very quickly. But if I don't bring them, my mother will start up an old fight about how she thinks I'm embarrassed by our family (or worse: I'll have to deal with random distant relatives making comments about nonexistent relationship issues between me and a partner that they don't even know).

I'm not a bridesmaid, I'm not close with my sister, and I have a really strong feeling that the night is gonna end with me getting a lot of attention (either positive or negative) and hurting her feelings. So, am I the asshole for wanting to say ""fuck it"" and ditching the wedding for a calm night in? Or should I just suck it up for one night and try to take the route that makes me look like a shitty sibling so that the wedding can go smoothly?

Edit: had to fix pronouns.

Edit 2: I've seen comments where I wanted to clarify this a couple of times so I might as well include it in the post. My sister used to give me a really hard time for not being as good as her, which is why we're not close now. My partner and I aren't married, but they're the kind of actor that you can't go out to lunch with because they'll get recognized, so I'm considering asking them to stay home because they weren't explicitly invited (my sister told me that bringing them as my plus one was fine, but I feel like it may have just been a courtesy thing).",Asshole
AITA for shouting at my parents after they started judging me after I lost my licence.,"I (M21) lost my licence about 2 months ago for speeding and I had to go to court. I also had to pay around 500 quid and attend a speed awareness course or something like that. The problem is that I need my car as I live in a awkward place. While I know that it is illegal, I bought a 600 pound car so I could drive to uni and back as it is only 30 mins away.  I am suspended for 12 months so I can't get insurance so if I get caught, I may go jail. 

My parents were angry that I lost my licence as the police confiscated their car because I was driving it. They got it back after paying for it back. After they found out that i bought a car while being disqualified, they shouted at me telling me that I'm an idiot for getting caught and arrested. However, i tried to explain that I didn't go to jail and I was only detained. They didn't listen and it got heated again. They told me that I am not allowed to park my car on the driveway because they don't want to do anything with my ""illegal"" activities. I shouted back, telling them that I can do what I want. After that, they ignored me and told me that they want to have a few hours to think. My brother heard and he said that I shouldn't have done that and screamed at them. I also asked my GF and she said that I should be able to do what I want.

AITA for expecting my Dad to fund (some) of my life?,"So my Dad has always been quite wealthy, and currently earns (although it is not clear because he never tells us) over $200,000 USD without paying income tax (Not American) per year. He tells us that he is also a high net worth individual and therefore has at least half a million USD in cash sitting in different accounts. He works overseas for at least 9 months a year.

As a result I can only count on one hand the number of things, activities or interests that we have done together, none if you count things that I personally enjoy despite the fact that I am now 20 years old.

Now I am in university, I am expecting him to pay for my university accomodations which are $195 a week. On top of this I also want to go on a three week holiday with him to do something \*\*together\*\* between us since I've not done anything with him, and I want to do something with him before he becomes unable due to health or age. (probably $5000)

He has accepted that he do both but on the condition that I find work and pay for some of the costs. I am not against finding work or paying for myself but I feel that since he has really let me down personally with his avoidance to spending in other ways in my life.

(We went on holiday and flew budget and then stayed at a \*really\* shitty run down campsite in a shitty town, (edit: something he only chose because it cost maybe 10% less than a nice cottage to stay in for something half the quality). not something to expect from someone who earns at least $60/h, I feel this is an unreasonable stipulation, especially since its easily affordable for him.

All I expect is that he pays for my accomodation so that I can use my other grants to pay for food, transport and hobbies. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs and my hobbies are all initial investment heavy with high return but low running costs. So I wouldn't describe myself as being unreasonable with money. I do not expect him to contribute outside of this at all. Edit: He does not and will not pay for my tuition fees, food costs, transport, or any personal costs like phone, hobbies or subscriptions. Nor would I expect him to continue to contribute as much if at all for either as such once I found stable income.

As an example of my perspective, my Dad has always been very financially controlling over my mother and has only allowed her a small allowance before she divorced him. I have never recieved any money outside of savings from him that I have used for funding occasional days out and things like my mobile phone or my laptop and then paying for food and rent for my university. He also only allows for people to be given money under stipulation or condition like it were a grant from the financial department so it is always a fight to get him to pay for things that need to be paid for.

So AITA for expecting him to pay what I believe to be his fair share considering his wealth?

Final edit:

Thanks to everyone who commented about the situation and didn't devolve to personal insults.

Any YTAs basically boil down to telling me I'm spoilt because I expected to not live in near poverty as a child because its ""his money"" which is stupid. He's my father. You wouldn't pay for your kids at all? What the fuck is wrong with the lot of you, that's disgraceful behaviour.

AITA for hating my mom for not warning me about acne scars?,"I am a guy and when I was 18-20 years old I started getting acne on one side of my face. My mother decided to home-school me up through the age of 18. This left me socially handicapped and I really had no idea what acne even was. While living at home and going to community college I started to break out around the age of 19. When I wasn't paying attention, I unconsciously would pick at my pimples as well as shave over them, scarring one side of my face. (The area I got acne was in a corner of my face that is very hard to see looking straight into a wall mirror)

During this period of time my mother had to have noticed because she had bought me products to put on my face and would leave them in my room without saying a word. Is it unreasonable for me to have expected her to warn me not to pick at my face? Or how to wash my face and take care of my skin and avoid scars?

I should add that I struggle with common mental health issues including anxiety, so that could have contributed to the picking behavior.",Asshole
AITA for telling my white mum she shouldn't say the n- word?,"So, the context behind this is a bit strange... me and my mother were watching Harry Potter and she was talking about the snake, Nagini. I made a joke (not a very good one) that it's a slur and she can't say that. She was confused and asked why. I explained the joke telling her it sounds like the n- word, and she replied by saying the actual n- word phrased as a question.

It shocked me, because hearing the word from a white person always feels so wrong and I didn't expect her to say the actual word. So we began arguing about it. Her argument was that she wasn't saying it about or towards someone and it wasn't in a hateful way. I'm not very good at arguing, my biggest counter argument was just that if you're white, you shouldn't say it at all. Simple as that. My sister agreed with my mother. My mum continued to use the word throughout the argument, but made it a point to say that it's a horrible word that she would never directed at someone.

Hope this belongs here? Maybe it's not a situation where someone is the asshole and someone isn't. It's a fairly complex issue. Any opinions, especially from POC who I'd say have more of a right to the decision that a white person does, would be helpful.",Asshole

But what took the cake is after we left the movies we went to get a drink and discuss it and she was just super quiet... Almost cold I would say. I kept asking her trying to include her in the conversation and she just kept saying things like ""yes the costumes were amazing, the actors performed really well etc"". But I could tell that she was getting more annoyed so I asked her if she was okay and if she didn't like the movie or what. She said she didn't. Then it kind of escalated with my friends being nosy and basically pulling out the Information of why not... Which I didn't condone but I admit at the moment I didn't say anything. But when she answered them she had a very rude attitude about it and I didn't like it.

AITA For Expecting My Bf To Get Me A Gift He Can’t Afford?,"My bf and I have been together for years now. Our anniversary is coming up up in two weeks. Usually he would get me a special card, a bunch of candy and a random trinket. I do love them. I’d either get him a pop figure or bake him something, since I didn’t make much money doing freelance work. For birthdays we just give the other what they need. I.e. last year he started working out, I got him gloves. 

This year though, I got a steady full time job and can afford more things. Bf on the other hand quit his job and is doing a part-time, making less. I don’t know by how much. 

His birthday was close to Comic Con, so I decided to get him a prints and an autographed shirt by his favorite wrestler. He’s even been asking me to get him an anime figure for our anniversary. I preordered it. 

Since we’re doing this, I asked him to get me a custom plush that’s $150. He was iffy since he’s also been saving money for jaw surgery. I can afford the plush , but I feel it’ll mean more from him. Roommate thinks it’s unfair of me to ask him. That just because I can splurge don’t mean he has to. I feel that if he can ask me to get a $60 figure for our anniversary, I can ask for a plush that’s for both our anniversary & my birthday.

AITA for telling my cousin she is overweight and needs to lose weight in front of our family?,"Please read before rendering judgment. 

&#x200B;

I'm 18 and an ACE certified personal trainer. I've been working as one for about six months now, while finishing school. I always start off by creating a profile for my clients. It includes name, age, sex, current weight, BMI, body fat percentage, any injuries, goals, etc.  

&#x200B;

My brother proposed to his fiancée two weeks ago. They haven't set a wedding date yet. At my grandparents' house last night, several family members asked me if I would be willing to help them get in shape for the wedding. I said of course, but that they would have to pay me, and I asked when they wanted to set up the appointments. They were fine with paying me, but they wanted to do the initial consultation then. I really didn't want to, but I agreed.

&#x200B;

The first few went over pretty well. Most were not thrilled to learn how much they would need to lose to be within a healthy weight range, and they weren't thrilled to learn that they would have to lose weight in an overall manner (or that spot training could make the problem areas worse), but they didn't kick up a fuss. Well, my cousin Natalia, 21, made up for them.

&#x200B;

Nat is 5'4"", 163.8 lbs. Her BMI is 28.1, placing her firmly in the overweight category. In order to have a healthy BMI, she would need to lose 18.2 lbs. (I'm looking at my notes right now to make sure I get the numbers correct.) Nat didn't want to hear this at all. She says that she's a size 6, and that means she *can't* be overweight. I showed her the charts and used two different BMI calculators, including the CDC's. She still didn't believe me, and she accused me of trying to humiliate her.

&#x200B;

This morning, I had a few awkward conversations with some relatives. Many were concerned about what I had told her because ""she really isn't that big, you know,"" and ""don't you think it's a little harsh to suggest someone her size lose that much weight?"" as well as ""you really should have been clearer when you said we might not want everyone to hear this."" They really made me question if I should have *insisted* that I do the consultations privately. On the other hand, I *did* warn them. Also, a few other relatives said that really kicked them in the ass to realize that their clothing size doesn't mean they're healthy, and they've scheduled appointments for the upcoming week, so I don't know.

Me and a friend (20F) were spending time together at a restaurant one day, and we sat on a table close to one where an older man and his son (no older than 20) were sitting.

We live in the Balkans, so English isn't the native tongue, so when I heard them talking in it I figured they're just visitors, which is no problem, it's the summer and people are coming here on vacations, nothing weird with that.

While chosing what to eat I couldn't help but listen in once I heard part of their conversation, the son was talking about guys and girls he thought looked nice from his job in considerable detail. It kind of irked me, not because I'm homophobic, but because they chose to talk about this in a pretty busy public place. After sitting through 5 minutes of their conversation which I couldn't just block myself from hearing, I turned to them and asked them to please talk about this when they're in a more private place and that it's not very fitting to discuss this here. The son looked incredibly embarassed and his father gave me an ""are you seirous?"" look before telling me ""How dare you?"", then both of them got up and left.

My friend was pretty on the fence about this, because she too thought it wasn't the place to discuss this but we could have just moved tables. I personally don't think we should have switched seats because of someone's inappropriate conversation. AITA for doing what I did?  


EDIT: Okay then, 3 minutes ago and already a bunch of comments... to explain further what was being talked about, he was describing features he found attractive and said why he'd date whoever, and what he'd expect in a relationship with them. I spoke up because I didn't want to listen about this guy's turn-ons and expectations, both sexual and non-sexual.",Asshole

AITA for acting like my girlfriends slave?



A little bit of backstory, me, my brother, my cousin and my girlfriend are living with my parents (my aunt and uncle lost custody of him due to unrelated reasons) due to the thing for about 1 month now,AND IT HAS BEEN HELL, my parents are ""old fashioned"" as hecc.

Examples: no elbows on the table, no electronics at the table during dinner, church every Sunday from 10 am -12 pm etc.

My cousin likes to think of himself as my parents' second in command, if he sees us doing something ""sinful"" or ""unholy"" he will report it to my parents.

Up after 12 am? REPORTED
Doing the s3x? REPORTED

One thing he hates it women having any authority over a woman (kinda hypocritical cuz he's fine with my mom having authority over him). Whenever my girlfriend asks me to buy her something when we go on family shopping trips (yes we do that) or asks me to do something, he will litteraly (out loud) read 1st Timothy 2:12 and then say ""did *girlfriend* her that?"" 

So anyway, after living with him, I got tired of his s#!#, so I told my girlfriend to act like I was her slave.
Whenever my cousin/parents would ask her to to something they considered a woman's job, she would go ""OP, do *task*"" and I would do it, if my phone was charging, she would go ""can I use your charger"" no matter what her/my phone was at.

When My cousin finally pointed this out and I said ""women are queens and should be treated as such"" my parents litteraly made me have video calls with a priest to ""cleanse my soul of the devil"" and I have no idea what to do.

We are having a ""gathering"" in a few days time and one of their  friends house and the priest is going to be there and so are their church friends, and my parents are forcing the 4 of us to go, and my parents told me that if I dressed/acted unmodestly, I would be grounded for 3 months.
My parents church friends have called and texted me basically saying I'm the AH and that I will burn in hell and all that other stuff.

So Reddit, am I the ahole for acting like a simp and going against ""traditional values

AITA for telling a woman that she looks fitter than her own daughter?,"I (21M) am the resident adviser of a freshman dorm. Tanya (18F) lives in my dorm. I’m not as close with her as I am with most of the other people in the dorm, since she never hangs out in the lounge. Her mom came to visit her last night. We met twice last quarter and her mom is very friendly to me. We have made some small talk. 


So last night I was in the lounge. Her mom came in and greeted me. Tanya was standing next to her. Tanya’s mom asked me if I have been working out a lot lately. I asked her how she knew. She gently touched my upper arm and said I looked really fit. I said she’s looking pretty great herself. She thanked me. 


I told her in fact, she’s looking fitter than her own daughter. For context, I have never talked about Tanya’s body before, but she seems like the confident type since she wears yoga pants all the time. Tanya and her mom are both in good shape. As a guess, Tanya is around 5’6” 130 lbs and her mom is around 5’7” 120 lbs. So not too different, but Tanya has slightly more meat on her bones. 


Tanya’s mom looked flattered from my compliment and thanked me while patting my shoulders. I couldn’t really tell what Tanya felt. She gave me a glare and took her mom to her room. Ten minutes later, they came out and Tanya’s mom said goodbye to me as she went out with Tanya. 


A few hours later, Tanya knocked on my door and asked me why I had to compare her body with her mothers. I told her I didn’t mean that to insult her but to try to say a nice compliment because her mom just complimented me similarly, and I really don’t think either one of them necessarily has a better body than the other. 


Tanya said that was tasteless of me, objectifying, and way out of bounds. I apologized to Tanya for my comment and told her I won’t make that type of comment again. She said that I should be thankful that she won’t report me to the housing office. I thanked her for helping me learn something new and promised to be more careful with my words. She said you’re welcome and walked away. It was near midnight at this point so I told her good night. She ignored me and walked to her room. 


Honestly, I still don’t think my comment is out of line to 99% of people. I think most people would handle it well and have a laugh out of it. But I definitely will be more careful around Tanya from now on.",Asshole
AITA for not giving my drunk gf a ride home when I had a friend who was in from out of town and I didn’t want the annoyance?,"K I’m a 22 year old guy my gf is 21, and my buddy is 22 as well. He’s in town for 2 weeks and we’ve been having a really good time so far. Well last night we ended up going to a party together and my gf had too much to drink. When it came time to leave i of course needed to give him a ride and I could tell he really didn’t wanna listen to or deal with having my drunk gf in the car being loud, etc. Also, I just really didn’t wanna make him deal with it since he’s only here for a couple weeks.

AITA for telling a group of girls I am gay so they would leave me alone?,"Sorry for formatting. On mobile. In case of mistakes, I speak English, I am just stupid. Also had post this twice so lets hope this works.

I go to a public high school that has a lot of assholes attending it. Most people who go there would agree. Due to a number of things I don't talk to other students unless they are my friends or close friends of my close friends. That might make me seem like a cold hearted asshole but you gotta do what you gotta do when most people make my life hell. Sometimes my friends say I am a bit of a bitch, I tend to be straight forward at times, but for the most part I do genuinely try to be nice. 

I stay after school for various reasons, on this particular day I was in the courtyard by myself. My friends had just left so I was on my phone. There was this group of girls being very loud at a table by where I was sitting. Most students are loud so I just block them out. I did notice though that one of them kept looking at me. I have a lot of anxiety and being stared at tends to make me pretty anxious. But I guess I can't blame people for wanting to stare at the random guy sitting there with a leather jacket and half black half blond hair (meaning I look a but odd or standout ish for my school.) I try to just scroll through reddit and ignore them but I hear them shout.

Girl1: Hey, dude!

I looked up, a bit annoyed that strangers were trying to talk to me.

Girl2: our friend thinks you're cute! Want a girlfriend?

I didn't have any time to think before I had a glare on my face. To me it seemed so childish that random girls would ask random guys out. I walked over to them. Looked the girl who spoke to me right in the eyes.

Me: I'm gay.

They all looked shocked so I guess that worked. I walked from the table into the cafeteria and into the classroom of my favorite teacher since she stays there a while after school hours. I told her this story and she thought it seemed kind of weird and awkward. I told some of my friends later and they said that I seemed a bit harsh and that I could have smiled and said no politely. But I don't think I was rude. Blunt, yes. But rude? Maybe saying I'm gay as an excuse was dumb and I should have just nicely said no. AITA?

AITA for telling my wife she cannot get a tattoo?,"I’m 32 M and married to 26 F. We’ve been together 6 years. 

When we met, it was obvious we had some differences of opinion on certain things. My wife loves tattoos and piercings, I hate them with a passion. I have some very strong opinions on this stuff. She expressed an interest in getting her nose pierced but I managed to convince her it would look unprofessional (her career is very important to her).

She stopped mentioning tattoos / piercings for most of our relationship. Today, January 1st, we’re talking about resolutions. My wife said she wants to be a little more adventurous and get a tattoo.

Long story short I obviously hate the idea and made that known. Of course I can’t FORBID it, but she knows how I feel about it and that it would definitely affect my attraction to her. I just think they’re ugly, end of.

She’s upset because she says I’ve always known she likes this stuff and she’s held off this long because of me. I say this has come as a shock because I thought she gave up on the idea. 

I really really don’t want her to ruin her perfect skin with a tattoo and they’re just so cliche now anyway.

AITA for throwing out a box of things that belonged to my boyfriend’s former girlfriend?,"My BF [28M] and I [26F] have been dating nearly 2 years. We moved in together last year.

From the ages of 20 to 25, he dated his previous GF. She broke up with him due to work and busy lives. That was her official excuse, but he told me that she was just “really afraid of settling down with me”. From what I gathered, she was his first love.

6 months after they broke up, we started dating. At first I was apprehensive because his ex was this beautiful, gorgeous model. I voiced my insecurities to my BF, but he promised me that he was ready to put her in the past. We even attended her wedding recently. He was emotional and even tearing up, but nearly every guest was.

My BF  has a large walk in closet with his things. When I moved in, he let me use the spare room as a closet because his closet was full. My BF is pretty neat but his closet gets messy fast. Due to work (and the weekly housekeeper being sick) he has no time to clean it, so I decided to clean it myself.

He’s never explicitly told me not to go inside his closet. I’ve been inside a few times, but mostly I have no reason to. Anyways, I got to organizing, and when I opened a drawer, I noticed a shoe box. It was pretty light for shoes so I opened it and found a nearly empty bottle of perfume, an old iPhone 4 with a cracked screen, a single mitten, and a lock of dark wavy hair.

The phone was nearly fully charged and could turn on. There was a passcode and the background image was a picture of a dog, which I recognized to be my BF’s dog that his ex GF gifted him. And the hair was probably hers too. I had never felt more betrayed in my life. I took the phone out, put the box in a bag, and threw it down the trash chute.

When my BF came home, I confronted him by showing him the phone. He looked bewildered and I told him how I found it. I asked him why she still had his ex’s phone. He told me that he had bought her the latest iphone one year for her birthday, so she no longer used the old phone, and he kept it instead. He admitted. to charging it periodically, said he didnt want to “lose any of the old photos of my dog and stuff”. Bullshit, iCloud exists.

Anyways he asked me where the box is. I told him the rest looked like trash so I threw it out. He was livid. He yelled at me and said I had no business throwing out his belongings. I told him, “they’re not yours. They’re your ex-girlfriend’s.”

I told him I deserved an explanation as to why he still kept his ex’s shit. Evidently he keeps going back to the box because the phone is 65% charged and its an old IPHONE. My BF admitted to smelling the perfume “once in a while” because the scent was “comforting and relaxing”. He says he is not reminded of her by it at all, its purely for platonic purposes.

Anyways, I’ve since been sleeping at my sister’s place. AITA for throwing the box out? It was basically trash, and plus he  is probably emotionally cheating on me by hanging on to “memories”.",Asshole
AITA: laughing and defending my brothers phallic swastika,"So basically short story even shorter, my brother (13) got in trouble for drawing a swastika in art class, made of dicks. Naturally, I found this absolutely fuckin' hysterical, and have told my parents that that he doesn't need punished, as it's just juvenile edge humor. Just tell him not to do it again, he already got detention at school over it and there's no reason to press the issue. I'm 27 and living on my own, if that matters.

My friends seem split on my advice and assessment of the situation, and seem to think that he deserves a harsher punishment. I should note that, afaik, this is the only instance of him getting in trouble at school, which is apparently the only reason his punishment at school was so light (3 days lunch detention).

So, what does Reddit think? Are some of my friends right in that that me advocating to not punish him makes me an asshole?

Also no, I don't have a picture, the school took it from him.

Update: Seems my advice was taken, he's not in any trouble at home, and was basically just told to stop being a dummy. They're also not kicking him out of his art class, so Hitler 2.0 averted, y'all can calm down now.",Asshole
AITA for telling my wife that I think that her miscarriage was for the best?,"Greetings, I know the title is bad but hear me out.

Me and my wife have been married for about 4 years...before we got married we decided that for the time being, we wouldn’t have kids until at the very least we own a home and are further along in our respective careers and are financially stable. Fast forward 4 years to now, we don’t own a home yet but we are making good progress on the other 2. 

Now she doesn’t use birth control because her body reacts pretty badly to it, so we’re good with using condoms. Well lo and behold, a while ago she started getting real sick and was throwing up everywhere for no particular reason. We took her to the doctor and it turns out that she’s preggo, a whopping 8 weeks along already. I’ll admit it; I was shocked. I didn’t know how to feel about it, and for a while I was going through the motions and trying to process it all. 

I then told my wife that I wanted to stay at my elder brother’s for a day or 2 while I process the whole thing..my brother is my best friend in the whole world and has helped me get through worse than this. I made it clear to her that I was not separating from her or abandoning her, just that I needed some time to process her pregnancy. So I left, and realized that the emotions I was feeling towards this pregnancy were that I didn’t want it, and I didn’t feel ready to have a kid. However, That doesn’t change the fact that it’s already here and so I promised to myself that I’d do everything I could to make the kid’s life better than mine ever was. (Keep in mind I never told her these thoughts; I just came home with flowers and chocolates and apologized to my wonderful wife for being moody)

I’m already approaching the character limit so I’ll cut this whole thing short and say that she ended up miscarrying. It was devastating to say the least but I can’t deny that I felt a tangible sense of relief, obviously again I didn’t say this and tried not to let it show but I was there for her and supported her and consoled her. So last night we were in bed talking and she brought up the fact that she noticed that I wasn’t as sad as she was about the miscarriage. I just shrugged and said it’s a horrible thing. She said yeah but she wants to know my full train of thought on it, that she feels like I’m hiding something. I refused to tell her, she persisted and I warned her that she won’t like my answer at all. She kept nagging me, so eventually I did tell her. I said to her verbatim: “ Here’s the thing. I don’t think I was ready for that child. Although I would have supported you through everything and been there for the kid, at the end of the day i didn’t want it and if I’m being brutally honest I think that the miscarriage was for the best for our marriage because I would have grown resentful.” 

She was shocked, long story short she’s staying with her mother until further notice and she’s very upset with me. Maybe I should have hid my feelings from her but I feel like we are a team and I should be able to tell her how I feel. AITA?

ETA: lots of YTA and that’s okay. The last bit where I said I was gonna be resentful, I was probably the wrong thing to say. I can accept that but I won’t apologize for giving myself some space to process the pregnancy which is a huge thing. If I didn’t then the situation would probably have gotten out of control. I supported her in every other sense, from going to get her favourite treats 45 minutes away, foot rubs, I did basically all the chores in the house, etc. So don’t tell me that I “didn’t support her”. Cause that’s simply not true.",Asshole
AITA for forcing my nephew to say a prayer before dinner despite him being an atheist?,"Today was our Thanksgiving dinner and I come from a pretty secular family. My family (my wife, daughter, myself) were hosting it for our family of some 25 people. My sister has a son, my nephew, who is 14.

I mention we come from a secular family because none of us really practice it or go to church, but we do say prayers before meals and will do baptisms, communions, confirmations, etc. It's kind of what every Italian family does. Do I believe in God? Not really, but I'll still say prayers.

My nephew is at that stage where he's beginning to question religion which I think is great. It's perfectly normal to be skeptical and question ""authority"". If anything, it lets him learn more about his culture and other cultures and become a more well rounded human because of it.

Today, my daughter was about to say prayers before our meal when my nephew gave an exasperated ""hmph"" which I took as cue as maybe he wanted to say prayer. So I asked if he'd do it and he did some big sarcastic speech about how God isn't real, blah blah blah. I consider this disrespectful because a prayer means nothing but tradition, the least he could do is pretend to partake in it, give it at least the tiniest modicum of effort. Not only that, but some of our family who *does* take our faith a little more seriously than others could be offended.

I told him, my 14 year old nephew, he can either say a proper prayer, or he will not eat. He hemmed-and-hawed for a good 3 or 4 minutes before finally giving in and saying at least a respectable prayer.

My sister pulled me aside later that night and said I went overboard but otherwise agreed with my sentiment. Even if we had no faith at all and it was just a little pre-meal speech of thankfulness, the least he could do was give a tiny shit and be a good person and do it. But he chose to be an asshole about it.

AITA for telling my girlfriend to try and get over her dads death?,"I, admittedly, have had a very cushy and plain sailing life in comparison to my girlfriend. My parents have been married for over 40 years and I’ve never had to worry about money or anything. My girlfriend on the other hand, has gone through a lot of trauma, mainly stemming from the death of her dad when she was 9. 

Obviously I never met her dad, but he didn’t seem like the nicest of men. He had an affair with her best friends mum, moved in with her, and then died a year later of a sudden heart attack. My girlfriend has suffered a lot of abandonment issues and grief, even though this was 12 years ago now. 

May is the month he died so she always lets herself go a bit in May, but promised at the beginning of last month she’d sort it out when June came around. It’s the third day of June and she’s still moping around. She’s been to counselling a few times but always gives up before she’s even given it a chance. I also think she should talk and get closure from the woman her dad had an affair with but she refuses. It’s been 12 years and whilst I am sympathetic, it seems a bit pointless to keep dwelling on something that obviously isn’t going to change. 

I said all this to her, adding that no amount of time is going to bring him back and that she needs to find a way to move on. She started crying and shouting that I was just another person who would never understand, nor would I try to. I asked my friends for their opinion and they’re pretty divided. Some saying that she’s allowed to still be grieving and some saying that she needs to let it go and move on. I didn’t want to hurt her but I feel as though I just said what I thought would be best.

He still looks like a baby learning to do these things for the first time. 


We were eating at a Japanese restaurant today and we sat across from each other. He had an udon. He kept dropping the noodles with his weak grip and poor technique when using chopsticks with his left hand. I laughed at him whenever he would lose the noodles. However, I got a little bit irritated when he dropped a lot of the noodles back into the soup and some of the hot soup jumped on my face. 


He apologized and I said he looked retarded trying to eat with his left hand and he has perfect chopstick skills with his right hand that he should use to not endanger those eating with him.

AITA for spraying my neighbour's children with my hose?,"I would consider myself the ""fun"" guy of the neighbourhood. I get along with everyone, am pretty funny, and generally sociable with all my neighbours. Part of that means that I enjoy playing jokes.

Each day, when the school bus drops off my neighbour's children (they are in primary school), I like to wait and blast them with the hose. I find this really funny, and obviously this is just a garden hose so it doesn't hurt anyone. 

My neighbours (the parents) do not agree that this is funny, and don't find the humour in it. I have explained repeatedly that I am only joking, and that my intent is not to cause any harm whatsoever. To me, this is simply a fun joke and sort of a ""thing"" that me and the kids do. 

So AITA here? In my opinion, the parents are being pretty uptight about this. They're kids, and no one is getting hurt. It's obviously worth noting that I do not do this in the winter, only when it is warm out. As it is currently summer, and the kids are not in school, I usually reserve this for when they are playing outside.

AITA For suggesting canceling my wife's gym membership?,"So here's the situation. My wife has been a full time mom, in addition to working from home for years. We have three children, aged 14, 11 and 8. A couple of months ago, she began a new 9-5 job as things have been tight financially, and I stressed that it would be important for her to contribute more financially. I travel a lot for my job, so I am gone probably 85% of the time, leaving her to handle everything at home on her own. Before beginning this job, she had been working hard at going to the gym every day, trying to get back into shape. I personally go to the gym almost every day as well, and have for years. 

Because she leaves the house by 7:45 in the morning to drop the younger kids off at school, then works all day, getting home at 6pm, the only time she has to go to the gym is at 5:30 in the morning. Evenings aren't possible as she needs to care for the kids, and prepare their lunches, feed them dinner, etc. She's also quite tired so there isn't really energy to go then. So she's been going before work for the most part. She started out going almost every day, but now she's been missing quite a few days. Today, after coming back into town after being gone for work, I noticed her BCAAs still in the fridge, and I questioned whether she had forgotten them. She told me that she hadn't been to the gym in a few days, and that's why they were still there. So I told her that maybe we needed to chancel her membership if she wasn't going to go anymore. She got very upset and told me that she's doing her best, but she's exhausted, and that she will work out as much as she can. I just don't see the point of paying for a membership if she's not going to use it. AITA?

Edit: I want to add that the reason I have this job is because we moved back to her hometown after 12 years of living in the town I’m from. It was only meant to be temporary( 1-2 years), but it was 12. She never got used to it and was very unhappy, missing her family and wanting more opportunities for the kids. So I agreed to move back to make her happy. She knew this would be the job when we moved(with me away a lot).",Asshole
AITA for making a dinner that will exclude my vegan sister since she’s making one excluding me?,"Alright this is a throwaway. 

According to my mom my sister (she’s 22) has been having a bit of a hard time lately. Just anxiety and stuff. She decided something that might make her feel a bit better is cooking a Valentine’s Day dinner for our family so she’s going to be making some sort of dinner, with appetizers and dessert, all vegan of course because she’s been vegan about 3 years. 

I thought that was a pretty good idea and sounded fun so I offered my help since I’ve been to culinary school and have worked as a chef. She turned me down saying she knew she was doing. Okay. Ouch. 

Since I still thought the idea sounded fun I decided to plan tovnake a dinner for everyone the next night, and told my mom I would most likely do pulled pork or maybe do some steaks. 

My sister got annoyed and said “so you’re makinf dinner for everyone but me because you’re mad I don’t want your help.” Which isn’t the case. I told her I also wanted to make dinner for the whole family because it sounded like a fun project. She said “it’s for everyone but me because you’re purposefully excluding me.” And I was like Jesus not everything is about you. 

She went off and probably sulked to her room. My mom kind of took her side and now is saying to if I really want to cook to wait to cook the meal I want to make next weekend maybe so as to not make her feel upset. I think she’s being unnecessarily bratty. AITA here?

AITA for spending valentine's day at the gym instead of with my girlfriend?,"I am a guy who has a committed workout routine, and I go on the same 5 days a week, and my girlfriend knows this.  I never skip a workout, and the only reason I would ever miss a scheduled workout is if there were some sort of family emergency.

I guess she expected that we'd be spending it together, but when I told her I can't hang out because I have to go to the gym, she got very upset and said that I can afford to miss a day of the gym for this special occasion.  I let her know that the gym is incredibly important to me, and I treat it as a mandatory part of my life that I must do, just like waking up and going to work in the morning.  I didn't think it was a big deal at the time, but she isn't returning my calls or texts, so I think she's pretty pissed off.  AITA?

EDIT #1:  People are asking why I couldn't find time for both:   Including my commute time, I work from about 7am-6:30pm every weekday, and including commute time, the gym takes up from 6:45 - 9:00pm. I needed to wake up at 6:00am the next morning, and she lives about a half hour away, so there wouldn't have been much time to have a real date night.

&#x200B;

EDIT #2:  I take night classes the other two days a week I don't go to the gym, so I couldn't simply move my workout to another day.

&#x200B;

EDIT #3:   I told her I would be happy to spend either tonight, or any day this weekend with her to make up for missing valentine's day with her, but she still doesn't find that acceptable.  I told her this at the same time I told her I would not be able to spend valentine's day with her.

Well his party was today, so last weekend, I asked her if she can give them to me Saturday morning. She said she’d get to it and asked if I wanted to Venmo her $95 or use another payment. At that point, I knew her prices were a little on the high side, but I thought it $95 was absolutely outrageous, and asked where she got the 95 from. She said they were $42.50 per dozen and a $10 delivery charge. I told her that it was way too high, and asked if she would be okay for doing it for like 45-50 bucks and give me a friend-discount.

She actually got really offended and got mad that I “had the audacity to ask to give her half of a normal customer”. I said I wasn’t really a normal customer though; I’m her friend, and she and I both know that $95 for some cupcakes was a little outrageous for some cupcakes.

She remained firm and said it was offensive to even ask for that and I apologized and said I didn’t really think it was that big of a deal. Also that I think it’s best that she doesn’t make the cupcakes. She was okay with that. 

Anyways about an hour ago, we were talking on the phone and she asked how the party went. I said it went great and I just gave them some cupcakes from this mom & pop cupcake shop down the street. Until this point, the conversation was normal and friendly, but when I mentioned the shop, she got quiet for a moment and then yelled and said “wait what the fuck, how could you buy from another shop over your friend?” 

I got flustered at the sudden aggression before responding back (probably in the same tone) that shop wasn’t trying to rob me over some cupcakes, and it was WAY more affordable (I paid $65 for them 2 dozen cupcakes, delivered). She said couldn’t believe I would go behind her back because I couldn’t be assed to pay a little more to help a friend’s, especially since I promised her I would months ago.

I told her I’m not obligated to buy her cupcakes, especially if she wasn’t willing to lower it to a competitive price and to honestly call me back when she stops throwing a tantrum. I hung up and she texted me saying “fuck you” so I just ended up blocking her in the end.

My husband said I should’ve just bought from the friend. His reasons were that they already gave us free ones last time and we can afford it the little premium. I told him that it wasn’t even about the cupcakes, it was about the rude hyper-aggressive behavior for being asked for a simple discount, and then getting pissy that I bought from someone whose prices were actually reasonable.

"AITA for telling my brother that he’s a fool to not make an advance at his new female housemate, who’s a professional model?","I’m (19M). My brother is 25 and single. Him and his friend used to rent a 2 bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. His friend moved in February so he had to find a new roommate. He found one (24F) from a Los Angeles Facebook housing group. It turns out that she’s a professional model signed by Wilhelmina who recently moved from Texas to Los Angeles. She has over half a million followers on Instagram. Plus, she’s single. I personally don’t find her that attractive, but I bet most people would rate her a 9/10. From her Youtube videos, Instagram and Facebook posts, she seems like a real down to earth girl who isn’t that superficial. She’s studying at the moment to become a health coach. 


My brother has been dating on and off for the past year. I know his type and his new housemate should be just that. I don’t think she’s out of his league either. My brother is 6’3”, decently fit and attractive, and makes a six figure salary. I talked with my brother about her a few times. We usually chat about once a week on the phone for about twenty minutes. He said that she’s a very nice person. I asked him if he has the hots for her and he said she’s pretty but he wants to keep their relationship as cordial housemates. I have advised him to try to make a move, but he kept saying that it’s inappropriate since she’s his housemate. 


I never pushed the issue until today. After talking about what’s new in our lives, I asked him again how it’s like to be stuck in the apartment with a model. He said pretty loudly that I need to drop this conversation because he’s for sure not going to make a move. I called him a fool to not at least try since she’s a nice and beautiful single lady living in a new state. He told me loudly to shut the fuck up and hung up on me. We were barely five minutes into the phone call. I think he’s making a huge mistake that he’ll regret when he’s 35 and married to a 6/10.",Asshole

AITA for taking away my son’s stuffed animal?,"I’m a mom to three kids, 2F, 9M, 14M. A few nights ago, I walked into my teen’s room to put something up. As soon as I walked in, he threw something under his covers. When I asked what he had, he lied and told me he didn’t have anything, I got frustrated and lifted the covers up. I found a stuffed lion that he got when he was little, I thought he had donated it a while ago. I got mad at him for lying to me and took it, I donated it a few days later since he’s too old to be having a stuffed animal in bed with him. It’s been a week and he’s avoided me almost the whole time, he hasn’t talked to me unless it’s about chores. AITA?

AITA For Not Rescheduling Me And My Husband's Date Night?,"I have a 17 year old daughter who unfortunately turns 18 on Valentine's Day. I say unfortunately because over a month ago, me and my husband booked a reservation at a fancy restaurant (an expensive place too, $100+ per entre) for just the two of us to celebrate on that day.  This restaurant gets packed on Valentine's Day which is why we booked so far in advance.

Tradition in our family is to go out to dinner and have a cake as a family the night of the birthday. It's rather simple but we've done it for almost every birthday so far. Last week, my daughter asked if we could go to a nice seafood place on her birthday. I said okay, not remembering me and my husband's reservation.

Yesterday at dinner, my daughter reminded all of us about her birthday dinner, and said that she made a reservation for the family (5 people total) since it would probably be busy due to Valentine's day. Right then, me and my husband looked at each other and remembered about our date that day.

I told my daughter that me and my husband booked a date night for each other on Valentine's Day and asked if she could postpone to the weekend. She looked at me and said she already had weekend plans because she was going to go out with her girlfriend on Saturday and had work Sunday. 

She asked if the two of us could reschedule our date but I told her it's a popular restaurant and that we weren't going to move it since there wouldn't be any other available spots. I've wanted to try this place for a long time and this is the best chance to do it.

My daughter went quiet and stopped talking, but I kept telling her we could go next week or sometime else. She refused to say anything, finished her meal, and went to her room. I felt bad so after dinner I went to knock on her door and found her crying on her bed. She asked again if me and my husband could reschedule but I explained to her how popular that place is, and that we won't have another good chance to go. I also told her that date nights for just us are rare, but we could go out as a family whenever.

I told her to change her reservation to next week but she just said ""nevermind"" and kicked me out of her room. I tried talking to her again this morning but now she's giving all of us the silent treatment.

My husband suggested that we just reschedule our dinner to make her happy but I really don't want to. Me and my husband never get date nights due to him working longer hours and me taking care of our kids. My daughter would be able to watch our younger sons that night which gives us a good chance to have a romantic evening together. This is an opportunity I don't really want to miss but my daughter's very upset about it. 

Who is the asshole here? Should I reschedule?",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t understand lactose intolerance?,"My (32F) little sister (21) found out she was lactose intolerant about 2 years ago and has not eaten ANY dairy since. She just completely cut it or if her diet even though most people who are lactose intolerant can enjoy small amounts of dairy no problem. She’s become annoying to go out to eat with because she always asks if there’s dairy in “x” dish. She also doesn’t eat meat so it’s doubly hard. 

My BF’s birthday was this weekend and she came over to hang out a bit. I got my BF a small grocery store cake to celebrate and offered some to my sister but she declined because of the dairy. I told her the amount of dairy in the cake was so small and mostly just butter which had barely any lactose in it she should be able to eat it no problem. She said maybe but at this point she hasnt eaten any dairy in over 2 years so the smallest amount now would probably make her sick. I tried to explain how most people with lactose intolerance can eat small amounts of dairy just fine but she still said she just wants to avoid dairy all together and she just feels so much better not eating it at all. 

I told her it was probably the placebo effect saying that to her and how I was frustrated going or to eat with her because we couldn’t share dishes anymore. She scoffed and said “You’re just mad because you’re also lactose intolerant but you don’t want to give up dairy so you just suffer anyways. You think it’s annoying going it with me? It’s annoying going out with YOU because you always eat the wrong things and need to find a washroom immediately.” 

AITA here? My BF doesn’t know why I pushed the cake so much and thinks I should’ve just let her be but I don’t know why she went to the extreme when she found out she was lactose intolerant instead of working better to understand it and eating dairy sometimes.",Asshole
"AITA for ""cheating"" on my girlfriend?","My girlfriend and I haven't been having sex much lately (last time was a month ago) so a couple of days ago I sat down with her and talked about it. She listened to me talk about how I felt, but didn't say anything herself. Early on in the conversation she looked fine, but as the conversation progressed, she looked more and more irritated by the minute. I told her my needs weren't being fulfilled,  she blew up after that and said ""go fuck other girls then"" I asked her if she meant it and she said she didn't care. I left to go home and haven't talked much after this.

Fastforward to yesterday night, where I went out with some pals to get some food. While we were eating our food, I noticed that my girlfriend's coworker who I am on friendly terms with walked into the restaurant by herself and started ordering some food. I walked up to her and asked her if she was alone and she replied yes, so I asked her if she wanted to hang out with me and some of my pals. 

It ended up being a great night. My friends and I clicked really well with her. She fit right in with our group, and we were all talking about going out again next weekend with her. We were all having such a great time that we didn't realize it was getting late, so my friends ended up heading out, leaving me and my girlfriend's coworker alone. We stayed for maybe another 20 or 30 minutes just talking about our interests. I told her one of my interests was computers and gaming and her eyes seemed to light up when I talked about it. She told me that even though she doesn't seem like it, she's also a massive gamer and computer geek.

I got excited after she told me this because neither my girlfriend or friends are into computers or gaming so I never get to talk about my hobbies much. She mentioned her awesome gaming set up back in her apartment, so I got excited and asked her if I could come see it really quickly. She said yes, so we both ended up leaving to her apartment. Her set up was as amazing as she said it was, I was pretty much drooling over it. I told her that it was amazing and that finally I found someone to play games with since no one else I know does. She teased me a bit and said that I'm probably too nooby for her. I laughed and told her to fight me.

After I told her to fight me she started throwing little play punches at me and I responded with them back. This lead to us getting a little more physical in a playful way, which caused me to get aroused. I didn't play on doing anything with her, but then I remembered what my girlfriend said during the argument that we had so I thought that it would be okay. Needless to say, we ended up having sex two times and I stayed the night and then left to go home in the morning.

My girlfriend found out today and she's been blowing up my phone calling me a cheater all day. I told her that I thought she said it was okay for me to have sex with other girls, and that I only did it because of what she said. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not helping my wife workout after she “cheated”?,"I don’t know a better word than cheated. She didn’t actually cheat on me, but she is cheating her diet. 
 
My wife and I were pretty unhealthy. I was about 200 pounds, when I decided to change. Now, I’m down to 150. So, I’m a bit proud of that being done in just 2 months. 
 
My wife started to join me in my diet and exercise regime. My diet simply avoids most simple carbs and some overly processed fast food. We do have treats every now and then.
 
My wife has been eating midnight snacks for the past couple weeks. She’s also been complaining that she isn’t loosing weight. I’ve told her multiple times to stop eating entire meals during midnight, but she doesn’t listen to me. It’s honestly starting to irk me off that she’s doing it. Yesterday, I decided to not help her and focus on myself. I’m not going to force her to not eat midnight snacks, obviously. But, I don’t think she deserves my help if she’s doing this.
 
She’s not even overweight or unhealthy. But, she got super mad at me when I said that. I think it’s entirely fair. If she wants to make her own regime, then she can.

"AITA for laughing when someone in my work group said she had gotten over a ""fear food""?","I work in a mid-sized office with one of those stupid layouts where you can see everyone, people can chat at tables, etc. Think the ""cool"" tech office. 

Well I was working in a group with a few admins/project managers and the conversation ebbed and flowed. I'm an introvert, but I don't mean that to excuse asocial behavior like some people do. 

One of the admins, a woman, said something like, ""Ohh, I finally got over one of my fear foods this year. It took a lot, but I can eat it in small amounts.""

Another admin said ""That's great! What was it?""

""Peanut butter.""

And here's where I come in. I laughed a little and said ""You were afraid of eating peanut butter? Like what, it would get stuck in your mouth and you wouldn't be able to talk?"" I laughed a little more. A few other people chuckled lightly. 

The first admin looked shocked and embarrassed, and said ""No, that's not what fear food means. Um. Nevermind."" She got up and left from the group, and for the rest of the day she worked alone in the other side of the office.

The second admin was glaring daggers at me and told me I was an asshole and should have kept my mouth shut. I countered it with saying I've never heard of people being \*afraid\* of eating peanut butter. She said that it was part of the admin's eating disorder, and that I should pick up a book, or just stick to not talking in group settings like usual. I thought that was a pretty mean thing to say and came back with ""Maybe she should stick to not talking about her mental health issues in the office if they're so sensitive.""

I'll admin I got a little heated, but I don't feel like it was wrong of me. However she and a few other admins have been nasty towards me. I looked up what fear food was and as a peace offering I brought in a PB Twix for the admin since she said she'd gotten over it. I left it on her desk and she left that day in tears, and now several people won't even talk to me. AITA?",Asshole
AITA? Delivery driver refused to answer my phone calls so I cancelled my order and reported her,"I ordered some lunch through Door Dash today. However I forgot to request some dipping sauce for my chicken, so once my delivery driver got the order I gave her a call to let her know. 

Her phone rang once then went straight to voicemail. Obvious ignore. A moment later I received a text message saying (copy-pasted):

Thanks for calling! Right now I’m driving either to a restaurant or to a delivery location. Feel free to text me and I’ll respond once I’m no longer driving.

I thought this was pretty rude and silly, because no respectable employee would ignore a customer like that and no respectable business would allow their employees to do so. I immediately called her back, same thing happened. I called a third time, hoping she would get the hint. Still, same thing happened. I was frustrated and upset, so I cancelled my order. I wasn’t able to report the driver through the app since she never even picked up my order, so I ended up calling door dash support directly to let them know that a driver was ignoring me. All they said was they’d take care of it. 

A bit later my girlfriend was wondering where our food was, so I explained the whole situation. She looked confused and asked why I didn’t just text her like the message said, and I told her that it was a matter of principle—I am the customer and the driver doesn’t get to pick and choose how to do her job. She argued that it’s perfectly reasonable for people to not want to take phone calls while driving, especially with the stormy weather we’re having today. I argued back that if the driver is willing to cut corners over bad weather then maybe she should stay home. My girlfriend called me an asshole and then left to get us our lunch. 

So Reddit, am I *actually* the asshole or is it not reasonable for me to expect my delivery driver to communicate with me?

Edit: everyone keeps saying she’s not allowed to answer the phone while driving and I totally get that, but like, why am I given the option to even call her when she’s driving? If it’s really such a big deal for her and the company to not take phone calls then why would they make it possible in the first place? You’d think that her having me text her would be more irresponsible and dangerous than answering my damn call and putting it on speaker",Asshole
WIBTA if I told one of my student’s parents to talk their son who has the lowest grade in my class out of being a SpaceX engineer?,"I teach AP Calculus at a non-semestered school. The school is in Canada but the child in question is from USA. He has the lowest grade in my class with a 42. He came to me for help before the and told me that he wants to work for SpaceX or Tesla. It took everything in me to not burst out laughing in his face. I was thinking that what he’s saying makes no sense, even though he’s an American citizen, they have a large pool of overqualified applicants to choose from than to choose someone struggling to pass high school calculus. I have parent teacher interviews next week and spoke to his other teachers. He’s a good kid, but he’s just not cut out for a STEM field. He’s doing good in his English course and chemistry class. But he’s marginally passing AP physics, his space science course, and my class. 

I am speaking to his parents next week since they scheduled a parent teacher interview. Right now he’s not even eligible for any university’s engineering program in Canada or USA since you need atleast 70% in the prerequisites. I feel like he’d excel more in another field, or even trades. I was planning on showing his parents his tests and his grades and telling him that he opened up to me of wanting to work at Tesla or SpaceX. I was going to tell them to gently have a talk with their son, about exploring different options since the deadline for applying to universities is approaching fast. WIBTA if I do this?

"AITA: My wife wants her Mom to be present around birth (not it the room), but doesn't want mine to be, and I don't think this is OK","A little background first, my Mom (of course I am biased) is the sweetest most caring person in the world, would make sure she is not in the way and would not be offended by being told to wait outside the room/even wait a couple days to see the baby (I would be way more offended by this). My wife expressed that she wants to have her mother present, and I was already exploring options to book multiple flights (due in 5 weeks) in ways that we could cancel flights as we got closer and closer (Southwest is great for this but offers no standby options - which I just established by calling). I told my wife I would like for my Mom to also have the option (equal opportunity and it is pretty important to me) and she just responded that she doesn't want that, no reason, honestly it feels like just a power trip/are you willing to prove you care for me by neglecting your mom response (also know that my wife lived with my Mom for a couple of years and they got along great) sure you can say that I don't know about hidden issues, but I can all but promise you that it is not this. I responded kind of strongly that I want my Mom to also have the option of being there and that it is important to me, which my wife is now upset about/I'm in the doghouse. AITA here?

Addition: Both our Moms would have to fly in to see the baby, so I'm not talking about being present at birth I'm talking being present around birth (even a day or two later)

Doing one more edit: I'm NOT asking for my MOM to be in the room, I'm asking for her to be able to be here after the baby is born...I am really confused...I completely respect any of my wives wishes during the labor and even the day after...but why can't it be important to me for my mom to see my newborn child......

&#x200B;

OK one more edit to clarify: I do not want my Mother to make my wife in anyway uncomfortable (beyond being able to see my son), my Mom will not stay with us, my Mom would only see our son in what I would consider a reasonable timeframe taking into account my wives wishes that are at least somewhat in accord with what her mother is afforded in seeing the child (not equal) but if her mom is able to spend time with the baby in the first couple days, I expect my mom to have the same opportunity....that is all I am trying to say, that I would like my mother to have a similar opportunity to interact with the baby as my wives mother this is our child",Asshole
AITA for telling a cop he is despicable for giving me a ticket?,"I'm a RN who works in NYC (I commute from a neighboring county, takes about 45 minutes to get to work with no traffic).

I don't need to explain how horrible the situation is right now on my unit, but today at least I saw more dead patients than alive ones. I wrapped more bodies for the morgue than I ever have in my 6 years of being a RN.

After leaving work around 7:30pm, I drove home. The roads were completely empty right after I got out of the city. I guess I was a little hard on the gas (78 in a 65). I really didn't notice since I typically go 5 over, but this was my fourth 12-hour shift, and I was going in tomorrow to help the unit since we are overwhelmed.

After I passed a cutout in the highway (cop almost never sits there), I saw him and braked.. too late. He had pulled out and had his lights on. 

He asked where I was going/why I was going so fast and I explained I was a nurse (I had scrubs on) and that I really wanted to get home so I could shower, eat some dinner quick, say goodnight to my kids and fiance (I sleep in a separate room to keep them safe). He then said to hold tight... came back and gave me a ticket. 

Now typically I support LEOs, I think they have a tough job and when done right are great people. But here I felt it was so wrong. I said ""really?? you're giving me a ticket"" and he said ""yes maa'am you violated the law and there are consequences for that."" I just was at a loss of words and told him he was despicable for doing that, he replied ""haha, okay""

Now before everyone says to get off my high-horse, please... I've been given a ticket before while heading to the beach with my girlfriends and I fully accepted it and had no reason to speed. But today, with everything we are facing, I just felt like it was a slap in the face. Especially that the NYPD and FDNY applaud us as we enter/leave work. It felt horrible.

AITA for cutting off contact with my best friend because of his FB post?,"I’m going to be very honest. He’s been a friend of mine for 20 years. At one point we were gunna get together but life got in the way.
Regardless we always remained best friends mainly bc the time was never right. As a chick, having a friend like that is priceless. However, he announced, very, very publicly a little over a month ago, ON his FB fan page about a year after he started it (he plans to someday make money from it and quitting his job or something) that he is attracted to guys. 
Now before people jump down my throat the fact that he said this makes no difference to me. Like I said we’ve been friends forever, I trust him with everything and accept him 100%. 
This man is not gay, bi or even remotely attracted to men. At all.

AITA for not wanting my dad to marry his GF?,"My dad started dating this lady a few years back, and unfortunately she’s a teacher who works at the school my brother and my friends go to, making things really awkward when our friends try to come over. I go to a private school so she’s never taught me, thankfully. 

Moreover, my father was largely absent from my life. He had us with our mom (who passed away) right out of college and originally worked as a software engineer. However, when my brother and I were still really young, he decided to go to med school. Consequently, he had no time to raise two needy kids as a single dad, but throughout it all, he had time to date random girls in their early twenties, each for maybe two months max. 

Surprisingly enough, my dad seems somewhat serious about his latest girlfriend and even changed his work hours from the night shift to the regular 9-5 to see her more. I guess one redeeming quality about her is that they’re actually close in age and that she actually seems like an established adult, who you know, actually can work and provide for herself instead of treating my dad as a sugar daddy. 

Honestly, I was really surprised when he said she was his girlfriend. My dad has literally always dated the most attractive women--super tall, fit, really pretty and accomplished, presumably because women find him “hot” and he can take his pick because of that, I guess.

However, she’s overweight, has small eyes and has a gap between her two front teeth and to top it all off, is a teacher. Moreover, she’s really sarcastic, annoying, and intrusive. She tries to talk to me about my classes, activities and friends when I don’t want to talk to her at all. She even once tried to hug me when I was upset about my friend getting injured in a car accident. This was AFTER I told her I needed space and wanted to talk to my aunt instead (aunt and uncle raised me for the most part).

Anyway, I really don’t see what she has to offer looks or personality wise. 

However, recently, my dad asked me if it was okay for him to propose to her again, after I said no the previous times. I reiterated that I was uncomfortable with her and that she was really nosy and way too sarcastic for my tastes. I asked him what he saw in her also. Unfortunately, my dad didn’t even answer the question and just got straight up mad with me. I’m now grounded for the next month, which means I’m basically confined to my house outside of school and sports. 

I told my dad that if they got married, I wouldn't go to the wedding and that I'd move out to be with my aunt and uncle.

Was I TA for telling him I don’t want him to marry her? I get that my dad can pick who he wants, but she’s also going to be a part of my life for the long run if they do get married.",Asshole
AITA for calling out my coworker on his unhealthy eating habits?,"I have a male coworker who is constantly trying to lose weight and talking about getting healthier. He is not super overweight, but on the shorter side and pretty stocky.

He’s not super obnoxious about it but it bothers me to hear him talk about making healthy choices and whatnot, but then immediately negate those choices. Yeah a salad is maybe 300-400 calories which could be healthy, but a milkshake is at least 500, which offsets all the work he did picking the salad.

The other day, he ate soup for lunch and then immediately had a couple peanut butter cookies after. I decided to say something like “you do know that if you’re trying to lose weight, you’re not going to see any progress by eating healthy meals and high calorie snacks along with them right?” He was then offended and said he isn’t only trying to lose weight, he just want to feel better overall.

He and his family threatened not to come and he threatened to tell my family not to come if I didn’t invite his kids (they’re well-behaved but still, it’s MY wedding NOT his). He thinks I’m being an insensitive asshole, but it’s my wedding and I can do what I want. So AITA for saying no kids at my wedding (including niece and nephew) which caused my brother and his family to threaten not to come at all?",Asshole
AITA for not going to my brothers wedding?,"My brother is getting married next year and him and his partner have chosen not to invite any children to the wedding. This is where my husband and I have a bit of a problem, we have 3 kids and feel heartbroken that they won’t be allowed to attend their uncles wedding. I understand that it’s their day and if they don’t want other children there then that’s fine, but this is my brothers only 2 nephews, not only are we heartbroken, but they’re also old enough to understand that they won’t be able to come with us to their uncles wedding. They have a very close relationship and I can’t see why he wouldn’t want them there to celebrate this big life moment. 

I’ve asked my brother if he would reconsider and he’s not budging, he said they don’t want any kids there and that’s final. The wedding isn’t at a venue where kids aren’t allowed, it’s a hall that our extended family use frequently.

My husband and I have decided to not attend the wedding, if my whole family aren’t allowed to come then we won’t be there also.

Are we being assholes?",Asshole
AITA for not wanting my husband to change his last name?,"Hey all,

My (F23) fiancé (M25) and I are planning on getting married soon. We had a significant discussion yesterday evening regarding last names.

My fiancé essentially wants to change his last name to mine and have the kids adopt my last name. He says he wants to do this because he is a strong believer in the entire family having one last name. To me it doesn't matter. However, I have a strong attachment to my last name and want to keep it. The reason I don't want him to change his name (something that didn't even cross my mind until he brought it up) is due to societal reputation. My parents and extended family will be upset at me for ""being domineering"" and think I am trying to make some grand feminist statement (I don't even really consider myself to be a feminist). I also worry how people will see my fiancé, whether they will all look down on him. Furthermore, his parents already don't like me, especially since he joined my faith, and him changing his name will only lead to further issues w/ my future in-laws.

AITA For eating my roommates friends pizza because he stayed at our house for free,"I’m in college and my roommate invited a couple buddies up to hang out this weekend. I live with 4 other guys so he asked if they could come up and I was the only one who said no so I got overruled. Anyways his buddies come over and are friendly enough but seem like frat wannabes and go out for a night of drinking. They bring home a pizza afterward and save some slices for tomorrow.  Being it my house and they are guest and kinda loud I ate their pizza for not paying us anything for staying during the weekend.

AITA for telling my co-worker that she is leeching off the government and is lazy for not wanting more work?,"My co-worker and I both work in a bakery. We both receive the same amount per hour however where I work full time, (over 36hrs a week), she only works part time (12hrs a week) because any more and her Universal Credit (UC) will be cut. 

I did the maths and worked out that if she were to switch to full time, she’d earn almost exactly the same amount as she is currently being given by UC, (£50 a month more if she goes full time). There is space and hours available for her to work full time but she claims that, because she has kids, she needs the hours free and the UC as she wants to spend time with them on the weekends. 

I said that I’d be happy to work the weekend and she can take my midweek shifts so she can be with her children but she shot me down saying why bother when she can just not work and still get the same about off the government/UC.

I exclaimed that, as there is a full time position available, she shouldn’t be so lazy and should accept the job and not scam the government and some person in need of UC just so she can put her feet up and wait for her children to come home, instead of actually putting in a hard days work like most people.

Maybe I could’ve worded it better to her, but it just really struck a nerve when there are so many people who generally need the Universal Credit to survive. So, AITA?


Edit: Both her children are in secondary school. They are both lovely children who I’ve met. None of them have any mental or physical disabilities that make them need full or part time care. 

Edit 2: I was on the Universal Credit system for about 3 months before I got this job, so I know how unfair the system is, hence why I I’m so passionate about who neglects and takes advantage of it.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to let my son do any homework?,"So I have 1 school-aged son, and the issue of homework has, as it is in most families, been a contentious issue. I started out negative, simply because I believe homework to be ineffective/unnecessary, but I gave the practice the benefit of the doubt. I grew up in the early 90's so maybe things had gotten better, you know?

The first year of school was fine, just occasional reading materials, the second year we encountered problems. Every week there seemed to be another piece of homework tacked on, and we noticed our son wasn't responding well to this at all.

It came to a climax this summer, our son was starting third grade and was sent homework to do during the summer break. This was the final straw, and me and my wife decided to throw the summer homework away.

When confronted by his teachers, he told them we threw it away, and when they called us directly, I informed them that we refuse any future homework. They still let him attend but we've gotten a fair few barbs thrown our way. AITA for refusing the primitive and intrusive practice of homework?",Asshole
AITA for only giving one of my kids financial support for their careers?,"My wife and I have two daughters. Mandy (24) and Naomi (22). Both live at home. They've both got their own businesses but while I've helped Mandy, I've refused to help Naomi when she asked, but I do have reasons.

Mandy always succeeded academically. She did well at school, then got into the most selective/prestigious university in the country. She studied Economics and then studied for a Masters in the subject. Since she got into uni off the back of her great grades, we were happy to pay for her tuition. She worked in the financial sector for two years, before deciding to set up her own management consultancy. She needed an office to operate from, and I was happy to purchase the premises for her.   

Naomi also did well at school, but against our wishes chose not to go to university, because she ''didn't know what she wanted to do''. She worked a variety of jobs, including as a waitress, a cleaner, in a factory and a warehouse. To be fair she always worked hard and worked very long hours. She saved up a lot of money, acquired her heavy vehicles licence, purchased a large van and is now doing removals, deliveries and couriering. Business came quickly, and she ended up with so much demand that she employed two people and purchased another van. However, this also necessitated her getting a premises to use when dealing with clients. She asked me for help since I'd done the same for her sister. I refused. 

I made a deal with both my kids when they were growing up, that I would give them as much financial support they need provided they went to university and completed a degree. Naomi hasn't fulfilled her part of that bargain having left education at the first opportunity. 

Also, although she earns good money, what she does is back breaking physical labour. I come from a working class background and was the first person in my family to go to university. My wife was the same. We studied and met at a top university. While we have nothing against that kind of work and respect the fact that Naomi is earning good money doing it, I can't help but feel like she's going back to the life that both her parents escaped from. 

We had a row about it at dinner. Naomi didn't understand why I'd buy a place for her sister and not for her, and I explained my reasons as best I could. Things got heated because Mandy was winding her up about it, and Naomi ended up storming out and spent the night at her boyfriend's place.

I feel like I'm making the right decision. I made a deal with the kids which I intend on sticking to. My wife agrees with this but wants me to understand why Naomi feels hurt by this. I do understand and I don't want to be hurtful or play favourites, but the fact is I don't agree with Naomi's life choices and don't want to support them financially.",Asshole
AITA for pretending to be a woman to legitimize our Crypto club to the University Administration?,"Last semester my friends and I started a crypto investing club, in total we have 16 regular members and 35  all guys.

That the university doesn’t allow all male clubs.

I told some friends about it and while most are supportive some are mad at me for not looking for actual women to join our club. AITA?",Asshole
WIBTA if I sell a nude painting that my girlfriend drew of me?,"My girlfriend likes to make nude paintings of me. She gave me a few of them as gifts. I'm self-conscious about them.

I have so many other paintings of me nude, my girlfriend probably won't even notice that it's missing.

Edit: Okay, thank you for everyone's input. I still don't understand everyone's argument, but from what I could gather, you guys are telling me:

1) Sell it but make sure I don't let her found out.
2) If I sell it, don't split the money because then she'll know I sold it.
3) Ask her, and if she says no, go back to number 1.

AITA for getting mad at my parents for making me go on a bike ride with them?,"I’m a 29 y/o obese female (210 lb) suffering from depression, anxiety, Asperger Syndrome, and Borderline Personality Disorder. I live a very unhealthy lifestyle, being messy, isolated, addicted to sugar and gaming, and not making any effort to improve my life. I’ve been on meds, therapy, and even a few psych ward admissions. I’m also in a situation at work where HR won’t let me come back from unpaid leave until I’m in good enough shape to be on my feet for 7 hours a day. I haven’t made any progress toward physical fitness; I just never feel like it. I just wanna live in mental escapism all the time, especially in gaming, internet browsing, or even sleeping.
Fast forward to this weekend. I’m at my parents’ house visiting from out of town in rural MO. I love them to pieces, and they’ve been total champions for me my whole life. However, they’ve been frustrated that they’ve been supporting me financially and emotionally so far, and I haven’t put in the effort to being healthy and independent. Today, they decided to make me come with them on an outdoor bike ride as a push toward being healthy again. 
I HATED it. It was only about 1 1/2 miles, but I haven’t rode a bike in years, so it wasn’t long before my legs felt like they were on fire. I’m also terrified of bugs, and screamed and whimpered whenever any came near. My mom was mostly encouraging, telling me “You can do it,” and “You’re doing great!” Before long, though, her patience ran thin, and was getting fed up with me crying, “I can’t do it” or “It’s too much!” She said this was the “easiest bike gear in the world,” and that “a 6 year old could do it.” She also told me to “get over” my fear of bugs. “Nobody died from bugs coming near; it’s irrational.” 
Once we caught up to my dad, the words really went flying. We went back and forth about how could I expect to go back to work when I couldn’t even do this, and that I wouldn’t make my own effort to get fit again. At one point, my mom said “You’re like the old saying: ‘If it weren’t for the distance between the bed and the fridge, I wouldn’t have any exercise at all.’” That really struck a nerve with me, both because it came off as fat-shaming, and, sadly, there was a hint of truth to it. I complained the rest of the ride back from exhaustion, bugs, and nausea, the ride ending with me throwing up on the trail. It also took a minute to figure out how I'd get back since one parent told me to go with the other in the car ride home. ""Go with Dad;"" ""Go with Mom.""
I've thrown up two more times since coming home, and now feel like just staying shut in my guest bedroom until my train ride comes this afternoon. I know I need to get fit, but this felt like going from sitting down to running a marathon. My parents tell me I need to get over myself, and that it was my choice to become 210 lb. Now I want to isolate and self-medicate on junk food some more once my nausea goes away.

AITA for making a bet I 100% knew the outcome with an unaware girl ?,"Hello friends,

I have a coworker (I’ll name her Issa) who is a lot into fitness, specifically she is a lot into weight lifting. If memory serves me right I think she’s said she’s been doing it for 3 and a half years now and her body shows it. She is an attractive woman in a committed relationship (not me if that matters). But we work in the same floor and although I’ve never lifted weights I keep myself in shape with martial arts training, so we often have little chats about fitness, sports or diets in general. On top of this because of martial arts training I have an understanding of physical demands in regard to body weight and strength in general. 

Anyway, last week we were talking, and another coworker joined the conversation we’ll call him Edward. After Edward was gone Issa and I keep talking, one thing led to another and Issa had the audacity to say she could handle “guys like Edward” physically. For more context my rough estimates (which I can say are fairly accurate since I keep track of my weight, my peers weights for competitions) Issa is in her late 20s about 5’3 not more than 145lb and Edward (early 40s?) who is a Netflix junkie and has said he’s never been to a gym in his life and the only physical activity he does is play basketball with his kids on the weekends is about 5’6 not more than 185 lb. So, I called her bullshit and lack of self-awareness right away on her remarks which led to an argument which led to even more talking and the bet. 

Since we don’t have access to gyms right now and Issa’s home equipment is limited we went to a mutual acquaintance of ours a contractor (well call him George) who is currently living at a close by hotel that has a decent gym. I told my boy Edward he could have half of the bet’s money (30$ for him and $30 for me) and it wouldn’t take more than 20 minutes. After some warming up they did the three classic exercises that came up to see if she could outperform Edward. 

Max Bench press  

Issa – 105 

Edward – 145 

Mx Deadlift 

Issa – 145 (and I think she hurt herself) 

Edward – 185

Mx Squat (Edward struggled doing a full squat, so we modified the movement to like half the squat)

Issa – 115

Edward – 140

Faces were made, reality checks kicked in and disappointments were met I could see Issa burning inside (anger, sadness, disappointment maybe everything combined) but she kept her composure and accepted the loss. This week Issa paid her money on Tuesday like a true champ. Now, If the whole ordeal was between Issa and I, I wouldn’t be typing this. The problem is that we had 2 witnesses and of course everyone at work knows and now people are talking shit behind poor Edward and me. Should we give Issa her money back even after she made the bold claim which only I witnessed? And more importantly, Am I the asshole for taking a bet I was 100% secure I would win? 

TL;DR I made a bet with a fitness enthusiast girl that she could not outperform a nonathletic but heavier male lifting weights.",Asshole
AITA for continuing to follow Instagram models while in a relationship.,"I love my girlfriend more than anything AND I think she is the most gorgeous human alive. The problem is that I also like looking at nice arses (which she has).
However, she is on the squishier end of body types which I like but I do also like more conventionally attractive women. She is very insecure about her body and therefore me looking at other girls makes her think I don't love her. The thing is, I'm a young man and my brain hasn't suddenly turned off attraction for other girls now I've got one. 
I would never consider a relationship with these other girls because 1. I don't base things just on looks and 2. I like the way my GF looks anyway. That doesn't mean I don't still like looking, is that wrong?

I guess the question is, does she have the right control my life in this way or AITA for not taking her insecurity seriously enough? Because it obviously upsets her.
I honestly can't tell if she's being controlling or if I'm being callous.

EDIT: I just want to clarify that we have spoken about this together. She set the boundary to stop following them and I have stopped. I just want outside opinions on whether that is justified (I can't think of a better word)",Asshole
AITA for staying over at my ex-wife's house after me and my wife got into a huge fight?,"The past week has been non stop fighting with my wife and daughter and tensions between us all reached an all time high. It got to a point where I threatened to leave and my wife didn't try to stop me and instead said that it would probably best for the family if I did.

The moment she said that I began packing my bags ready to leave. I called up my ex-wife (she is single) to see if she had any room for me to stay? She was resistant at first but eventually agreed to let me stay over at her house with her and her 2 kids (who were from a different marriage).

The next morning I check my phone to see that my messages have been blown up by my wife. I have my location shared with her and she knows where my ex wife lives so she put two and two together and was telling me things like ""I can't believe you would do this to our family"" etc. ALL JUST BASED OFF OF SEEING MY LOCATION. 

My daughter called me a major AH and told me she wants nothing to do with me after putting her mom through all of this. I personally don't think I did anything wrong, most of my friends are married and I would feel like I'm intruding if I asked them to stay over so it made more sense for me to stay over at someone's place who probably has the extra room. My in-laws have been texting me too telling me what a terrible person I am and how I'm no longer welcome in their family.",Asshole
WIBTA when I told an acquaintance to check his privilege,"Context: I am currently enjoying a holiday in SE Asia with my father for one month. He has a business partner who is the heir to a well known foodstuffs manufacturing company which is separate from their endeavor. My father’s business partner has a son who has been living in the area for a couple years teaching English and otherwise navigating the laws here to support himself. We all decided it would be a good idea to meet and be introduced to the area by this son. 

We shared several rounds of drinks, and my father chose to take a cab to our place. I was happy to continue the night for a couple more hours, as did the son (who is a few years older than I). After more drinks, the conversation became political. At some point, I revealed my liberal bias and he revealed his conservative one. 

Anyway, we talked about money and the clear differences in society between our western home countries and our current situations. He revealed that he is essentially attempting to avoid the lifestyle provided by his privilege. I, in turn, said that he still had lots of privilege by virtue of simply being able to live like he does. He was quite offended and disagreed, stating that he was specifically trying separate himself from that life. I countered by saying that no matter his current choices, he is still the heir to a fortune and should recognize what that means and what that has done for him.

I come from an above average life, but I do my best to recognize what that means. He was saying that his family and upbringing had no bearing on his ability to travel the world and navigate the SE Asian cultures. So, WIBTA?

AITA for playing 18+ games at age 16?,"To put some context into this, I am a 16 year old girl. I saw a game called DBH being on sale, so I bought it, and another game called Heavy Rain came with it for free. Both games are rated 18+, but neither of my parents ever took interest in what games I buy and play. I had no idea what I was getting into with this game, but when I learnt that Heavy Rain is mostly a game about investigating a serial killer, I knew this was going to be something I'd enjoy. And I did. It's still one of my favourite video games, despite it being released almost 10 years ago. So yeah, I accidentally found a video gamel jewel for free.

Now, here's what happened. 

On a slow weekend my mom was using my dad's laptop, his only source of entertainment, and he started to watch me play some fps game on the tv. I suggested that if he wants to watch me play, maybe I could play something a bit more ambicious that has a narrative and can be watched like an actual movie. He seemed thrilled by the idea, and I was too, since we haven't played anything together since I was like 10 years old.

The game I suggested was indeed Heavy Rain. For those unfamiliar, it's like an interactive movie where you have to find clues and make decisions. The plot revolves around 4 playable characters, one of which is called Ethan, the father of a child kidnapped by a serial killer. All 4 characters have their own reasons for finding the killer and it's up to you as a player to guide them through a bunch of dangerous situations. Ethan's story is pretty much a Saw movie, where he has to do horrible things to get pieces of an address to his son's whereabouts, before his son dies.

My dad gets quite enthusiastic about this at the beginning, but rapidly begun to dislike the game as it went on. The deal-breaker was when I was playing as Ethan and the ""Lizard Origami"" task came up. I won't specify what it is because violence isn't allowed on this subreddit and I'm not 100% sure if it would be against the rules to talk about it here.

I kinda hestitate, but I eventually do the task because I don't want to risk not finding the kid. I want to make sure that I do everything I can to ensure that this child at least gets a chance to make it out alive, and the killer is apprehended.

When my dad saw me doing that task, he just walked out of the room and said I'm disgusting and that ""his daughter shouldn't be making those kind of choices"". Later he told me how messed up this game is, and that it will surely traumatize me and leave me mentally unstable.

AITA for playing an 18+ game at age 16, despite my parents not caring before? Was it wrong for me to make the choices that I did in this video game?

EDIT: A lot of you brought up the suggestion to talk to my dad about this just being a video game, and explaining why it isn't just mindless violence. It was one of the first things I did, and he absolutely refuses to change his mind no matter what I say.

AITA For asking my boyfriend to shave his beard...?,"Okay...so the title may seem kinda crappy on my end, but I’d like to hear some other opinions. I also tend to type a lot, so I apologize...SO. My very handsome and wonderful boyfriend of two years is 23, I’m 22. When we met, he was in the military. This being said, he was kind of forced to be clean shaven 24/7 for about 4 years. I constantly told him how great he looked clean shaven and VERY early on voiced my opinions on facial hair. 

I’ve never much cared for beards, I think it has a look of uncleanliness to it and I personally can’t stand the feeling of kissing someone with facial hair. Like, at all. For a year of long distance in our relationship, he did as he wished with his hair/facial hair. The 3-4 times we saw each other in that year, he made a point to shave beforehand so it wouldn’t bug me...after I moved in with him, that went out the window. His beard grows fairly thin, patchy and unevenly, but I will say he does make a point to keep it clean. 

He’s also in college now. I think managing how you look and being presentable around professors and such is important, because getting out of school you want those people to sing your praises in letters of recommendation when looking for a big job. Including their impressions on how you carry/take care of yourself. And if you are/look respectable and professional. He doesn’t seem to have the same stance and wants to grow out his beard in school, then shave before jobs when he graduates. 

I’ve told him how he would look better/more presentable if he’d shave. He doesn’t seem to care as much about that sort of thing. And I have on many occasions, mentioned how the beard scratches me and is uncomfortable when kissing and stuff. He has also on DOZENS of occasions said he’d do ANYTHING to make me happy/more comfortable. I usually jokingly say, “Even shaving your beard??” He laughs it off and doesn’t respond, or will also jokingly respond with something like “Anything EXCEPT that...”.

AITA For Calling Out a Friends Replica Clothing?,"Throwaway account

Basically my friends birthday was a couple days ago and he had a party for it and had a bunch of his friends over (including myself). During that party, he showed off these Supreme clothes and accessories that his parents had brought back for him when they went on a trip. For those here who do not know Supreme, it's a hyped streetwear and skate brand that is frequently faked because of its price and limited stock. Since I knew a fair bit about this brand, I quickly realized that at least one of the things he was showing off was a fake. When I told him that the item was a fake, he got pretty defensive quickly, insisting the item was real, when it was a pretty clear fake in my eyes. I don't believe that he knew it was fake, but I really don't know. I believe I am more knowledgeable on the subject than him, and insisted that it was a fake, even offering proof, but he got upset with me about it and quickly shot down what I was saying. Afterwards, I kinda felt like a dick about calling him out about a gift on his birthday, in front of our friends, but I also wanted to let him know that he shouldn't be bragging/showing off fake stuff. So, AITA?

AITA for getting a bride and groom kicked out of a restaurant on their wedding night?,"Ok, this sounds really bad but hear me out because I felt like I did the right thing at the time but now I'm second guessing myself.

About a month ago I was a restaurant with my husband of ten years celebrating his promotion at work. About halfway through our meal, a couple was seated at the table next to us. She was wearing a white dress and veil and he was in a suit so it's pretty obvious that they just eloped. They also looked extremely young to be getting married, but that's their choice so I didn't think much of it. My husband congratulated them and they thanked us. They seemed very nice until I couldn't help but overhear the bride say to the groom something along the lines of: ""Hey, do you mind ordering my drink for me?"" 

This struck me as odd as most grown adults wouldn't ask someone else to order for them. The groom nodded and the bride got up to go to the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, the waitress came and the groom ordered two beers. Something still seeming off to me, so when the bride returned and I asked them how old they were. She is 19 and he is 21. So, she obviously isn't old enough to drink so he's buying it for her. After watching them have a few more drinks, I decided this wasn't right. Call me old fashioned, but I am very against underage drinking as it can do so much damage and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with that. I know people who have ruined their's and other's lives over this and so when I see it happen I do something about it. So, I reported it to the hostess who then came over to ask the bride for her ID. The bride said she didn't have it on her. They went back and forth for about a minute and it ended with the bride admitting she was 19. The hostess then asked them to leave as they don't allow people to drink underage. The hostess was gave me a dirty look and my husband asked if I had said something. When I told him I had, he got pissed off at me and said it was none of my business to say something. I think I did the right thing as the bride shouldn't have been drinking underage and if she really wanted to drink they could've waited a year to get married. Besides, it's incredibly selfish and wrong to scam a restaurant that could also suffer major consequences for this. I also think that underage drinking is severely harmful and I am strongly against so I will speak up about it regardless of the circumstances. With that being said, everyone is saying that I was the asshole in this situation and I'm starting to second guess myself on the matter.",Asshole

I went down and she was playing a video game. We said good morning, and I asked her how long she’d been up. She said for a couple of hours. 

I jokingly said “bet you enjoyed having the house to yourself for a while” because my husband and I are usually are at work all day, and she’s usually home alone. 

She said “yeah, actually, it was kinda nice”. I didn’t expect a response like that, and frankly, it hurt my feelings. I said “oh, do I not do enough for you?” She rolled her eyes and said “you know that’s not what I meant” and I said “do you really hate your family that much?” She just ignored me that time. 

I gave her a chance to make things right and just drop it, and said “you know I’m not being serious” and she said “no I don’t because you say shit like this all the time”. I don’t tolerate that kind of language in my house, and she didn’t even drop it like she should have. I sent her to her room, and she went. 

I discussed it with my husband, and I went up to her room, and told her that from now on, since she can’t appreciate family time, that she may not leave her room until we are up. She got very pouty, and told me that I was being unreasonable. 

Thing is, she doesn’t appreciate anything I do. She constantly manipulates me, and doesn’t understand how hard isolation has been for me. Considering how she treats me, I think I am being more than reasonable. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for telling my mom who is on maternity leave to do some chores while she is home?,"My mom gave birth to my sister around 2 months ago. She hasn’t done any chores but I thought it was because her baby was too young but it can’t be that.

I came home today and it was all dirty and she hadn’t even made food or anything. I snapped and told her to fucking do something so that me and dad won’t have to do all of the chores after coming home.

She told me that maternity leave is to take care of the baby and not to do chores. I just asked her what the hell she did when the baby was sleeping.

AITA for getting upset my future FIL who has dementia couldn't remember my name?,"I recently met my fiancee's parents for the first time. We've been together for two years but we live across the country from her family, we are both grad students, and her parents aren't in great health and generally don't travel. I have known for the past year that my fiancee's father has dementia, although whether it's a medical diagnosis or just something the family suspects, I don't know. 

When I met my future FIL for the first time, I shook his hand and said hello. He said, ""Good to meet you, Brad."" My name is not Brad. Brad is the name of the serious boyfriend she had before me. Everyone immediately corrected him, saying no Dad, this is Kevin. \[all names pseudonyms\] Her dad said oh ok, sorry.

Her dad then proceeded to call me Brad the rest of the day. After the first few times correcting him, everyone (siblings, fiancee's mother, and fiancee) just kind of stopped. This infuriated me. I am not Brad, and her father should continue to be corrected until he gets it right. I kind of withdrew and said very little to anyone for the rest of the day.

When we got back to our hotel that night, my fiancee and I had a big fight. I told her her dad was being rude by constantly calling me the wrong name, and her ex's name at that. She said he can't help it, he has dementia and can't remember, etc. 

Well I question how much her dad truly has dementia. He ordered pizza for everyone and I heard him on the phone giving a complicated order (half toppings, no cheese on one, one square, etc.). Anyone who can do that should be able to get a name right. Her dad called his son's wife by the correct name, and they got together after my fiancee and I began dating, so likely post-dementia. 

I know her dad didn't like when his daughter started dating me because we are not of the same religion. I think he is using dementia as an excuse to humiliate me. I told my fiancee as much, and she raged at me, obviously. I also said that her unwillingness to even consider what I'm saying is proof that she is a Daddy's girl and in her eyes he can do no wrong. I'm worried she'll never take my side if he and I have a conflict.

AITA for spending $7000 on a Vegas trip with friends without telling my wife?,"So last weekend I went to Vegas with my two best friends and paid for everything which ended up being about $5000 for flight, hotel rooms, and food along with another $2000 in gambling losses.  My wife was furious when she found out how much I spent and said she’d never spend that much and i should have told her about it first (she wouldn’t have approved).  She knew I was going to Vegas, just not that I was paying for everything. I should also note that there weren’t any strip clubs or anything, so she’s only mad about the amount of money I spent.

My wife and I have separate bank accounts but we split all bills/family vacations/household purchases proportionally based on our incomes.  All extra money is our own to do what we want with it.  I make significantly more than my wife ($400k to her $100k) as well as more than all of my friends so I wanted to treat them to a fun weekend.

AITA for telling my wife she needs to stay home and do her job?,"I know that sounds bad but there is more to it. 

We have 3 boys under ten. They all do Karate and few yrs ago wife joined. When youngest was 1 she told me it was just going to be 1 night a week, but now she is gone 5 nights. 

The kids have their classes in the evening and she goes with them. she brings them home and then takes class for two hours too. Two of those classes she takes with our oldest. She says that she's already there so it doesn't make sense to just sit when she could ""train"".

She says that it's ""not a big deal"" since she does hw and makes dinner and all I have to do is put them to bed. To me that is such bs because that is the worst task. The kids will not go to bed for me, they get up constantly and just goof off. They just wait for her to get home to go to bed (of course it's easy for her) One night I could probably handle but every night of having to watch the kids while she goes off and plays is pretty selfish. And she is not appreciative. At least twice a week she complains that the kids are still up and that she has to put them to bed when she gets home. Even though she knows how much easier it is for her, and how stressful bedtime is for me.

I told her that she needs to start being home at night more. I work all day and I feel like I come home to a second job. I have tried to be nice about it but it's getting hard. There are dishes in the sink, and a mountain of unsorted laundry. At least once last week she let the dishes pile up for three days to the point where we ran out of utensils. When I pointed this out she just said sorry she was ""tired"". It's irritating that she can find energy to play but doesn't have energy care for her family or house.

"AITA For telling my cousin he can't be so reliant on a girl he likes, which made my own girlfriend mad?","Me (28 M) and my cousin (19M) have always been close and in a way I see him as a younger brother. He has never been good with dating/relationships unfortunately, but he ended up going on multiple dates with a girl that goes to his school.

Initially he described the dates as being really fun, that they have a lot to talk about/there's tons of flirting, etc. I only met her once but they did seem to have real chemistry.

So backstory is that he supposedly asked her what kind of relationship they have and she friendzoned him. When she messaged him again, he told her he was hurt and needed space. After a week, he messaged her back apologizing and would try to continue as friends. She ghosted him completely, which made him more hurt. He made a couple more attempts at messaging her but she ignored all of them.

He's been speaking to me a lot about this, but I basically told him ""most girls can be ruthless, stop being invested in that slut. If she got so offended that you were taken back by being friendzoned by her and wanted some space, she can fuck off. Go around, sleep with other girls, don't worry about any commitments or how they feel, just have fun. Eventually the right girl will come along""

Lately he seems to be getting over it, but when I told my girlfriend what I said, she told me I was out of my mind. Being that she's a female, I knew she wouldn't understand, but I felt my cousin needs to know that he needs to be a little less sensitive to these matters and dancing around the subject will only hurt him more. On the other hand, maybe my girlfriend is right that I could have toned it down? Either way, I just wanted to know if I am an asshole for angering my girlfriend like that.",Asshole
AITA for firing our babysitter because of his sexual lifestyle?,"My husband and I have a 5 year old daughter. We've had the same babysitter for two years without issue. He's always early, will sometimes stay late if something comes up, has a fair asking wage, et cetera. Some of his private sexual life came to light to us and we've fired him because of it. I want to know if we're the asshole.

What happened was he made a public Facebook post which I think was meant to be private or sent as a message to someone else. Or maybe he was drunk/inebriated and did it by mistake. The post was left up for some hours and I don't think we were meant to see.

The post was a message screencap between him and someone else. In it, he was telling this other person about a recent sexual escapade. I don't really want to post what he said verbatim but it involved a ""bathhouse"" (I didn't know these still existed), anonymous sex, ""poppers"", and ""prep"", which I learned is an HIV preventative drug for unprotected sex.

We told him the next morning as he was scheduled to babysit later that night that his services are no longer needed and upon pressing us, we told him it's because of his recent Facebook post. He was embarrassed but also very mad, calling us homophobic and et cetera. It doesn't matter that he's gay or bisexual (we don't know/care), it would have been the same reaction if it was a straight person posting about going to an orgy or whatever.

AITA Charging a Kid For Driving Her Home From School,"My teenage daugher rides bus to school herself in the morning and I pick her up and drive her home in the evening. Earlier this year there is another girl joining the ride.


She is my daughter's junior in school and lives in the neighborhood, about 5 minutes walking distance away from our home. She asked my daugher to ask me to bring her along and she would walk home herself when we reach home. Thinking that it may become a routine, I decided to charge the girl $1 for every ride. She was okay with it.


After a while, I could only pick up the girl 2-3 times a week instead of everyday, because their release time from school are different. My daugher suggest me to stop charging her as we only bring her along under our own convenience, but I said $1 isn't much, more like a gesture of appreciation than payment. She would have paid similar amount riding a bus. I have never forced her to join us, she did it out of her own free will. 


I got a phonecall from that girl's mother a while ago, telling me how greedy and shameful I have been for taking money from a child. She asked me to either take it seriously and pick her up every day or stop charging her money. I told her to discuss that with her daughter and I would still welcome her if she wants a ride, $1 each and only when it's convenient for me.

AITA for shaking my friend’s Diet Coke bottle as a joke?,"This happened earlier in college. A friend of mine from college who sits nexts to me in class left the classroom (which I assume was for the bathroom).

He left his bottle of Diet Coke next to his chair (which he does all the time), so, as a joke, I decided to shake it a bit.

Other classmates notice me do this. One of them even tells me that jokes like that could lead to me being ‘punched in the face’.

Later, the friend comes back to the classroom, and my classmates tell him what I did. He told me I ‘owed him a new drink’ since classmates were saying that ‘it became flat’.

INFO: I have a history of making bad jokes in College (mainly ex wife jokes) and the teacher never noticed me shaking the bottle.

All that being said, did I take my joke too far?

AITA if I made a joke about language barriers in front of two ESL people I was on a double date with at a Chinese restaurant?,"I went on a double date with my best friend Amy and her boyfriend the other night at a Chinese restaurant. Amy is from South Korea and moved to the US for school about 4 years ago. She is now a grad student dating another grad student from Ukraine. They both speak fluent English. 

Amy is kind of socially awkward and her engineer boyfriend wasn’t much better. They seemed nervous from the moment we arrived at the date. My boyfriend tried to make conversation a lot but it was just really lacking at their end. Amy’s boyfriend’s jokes were just not funny and they just couldn’t carry the conversation well.

My boyfriend and I still tried to make it an enjoyable experience. Something came up in service towards the end and someone said “oh we should complain.” 

I joked “I’m not sure how far a complaint would go at a Chinese restaurant” followed by saying in a Chinese accent “ok. We sorry.” Everyone at the table laughed. Nothing made me think I said anything wrong.

Then afterwards for days Amy has been saying that I am a casual racist and she doesn’t like my boyfriend and our sense of humor. I told her that I wasn’t trying to make fun of/target Asian accents specifically, just saying that the language barrier would be funny/awkward. I would’ve said the same thing at any restaurant with a barrier like that... I didn’t mean it maliciously. And despite me apologizing Amy has made it into a huge thing. I said I didn’t realize they were both ESL people when I said the joke, and I was sorry it offended her. It started a whole fight and I apologized probably 5 different times. Now she says she won’t accept my apology unless I understand it “from her point of view” and me saying I was sorry it offended her was the wrong way to apologize apparently.

This corporation does not offer paternity leave of any kind. 

We have a guy on our team whose wife just had a baby and has been struggling with postpartum depression. He was miserable not being able to be home to support her and look after the baby. 

So I looked into it and figured out we could do his work if we all stayed an extra half hour. I put the idea forward in an email and said we’d do it for a week, two if the first week worked out, give the guy a chance to be home like we’d all want if we were in the same situation. 

I couldn’t give overtime for it but I said I’d buy dinner from anyplace they wanted. 

Coworker was obviously grateful. 

Here’s the thing, I’d put the idea forward in an email, and someone accidentally copied me on an email they were trying to send to their other coworkers, basically I’m an asshole for suggesting it because if they say no they’d just sound like insensitive pricks and I shouldn’t have tried to circumvent the no paternity leave policy, even if the guy’s wife is having a hard time.

AITA for being unsympathetic to a friend that adopts elderly dogs and gets upset when they pass away?,"My (27M) friend (28F) is a huge animal person.

A week ago, her dog passed away from old age. She was crying the entire week, took a few days off of work, and generally hasn’t left her house. I went over to check on her yesterday. Because I’ve already been there for 2 other deaths, I was kind of desensitised. After listening to her cry for about a half hour, I said, “If you have such a hard time coping with a pet passing away, why adopt elderly dogs in the first place? Really, you’re just setting yourself up for failure.”

She said that I was being unsympathetic dickhead, and that I lacked basic human compassion. Then she told me to “get out”, and haven’t talked to me since. Which, if you ask me, is kinda rude. I think that I raised a valid point, but she just didn’t want to hear it. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for telling my parents that my sister makes out with her teddy bear?,"My 17 year old sister is the most stunning and smart girl I've ever met, I honestly have nothing but esteem for her. She's smart, she's funny, and she's got the greatest heart I've ever seen in a human. She loves the bully and the victim. She doesn't lack in confidence or male/female attention, and right now she has a male companion. I'm her 15 year old younger brother. If I'm allowed to exercise my ego for a moment I don't believe I'm bad-looking and I've got many friends, I have success in many areas of sport and study, and I have a steady girlfriend who I adore. In short, I'm not jealous of my sister.

Our house has a kind of weird layout and means my sister has the third floor bedroom, plenty of privacy, however there's a half floor landing between the second and third floor that houses her and mine shared bathroom that looks into my sister's bedroom, however because of the angle you can't really see the person the bathroom landing. A few months ago I went up for a midnight pee and her bedroom door was open and she was awake. I typically glance inside to check on her and on this night I saw her laying on her bed making out with her teddy bear. She's had this bear since she was three and she routinely patches his increasingly multiple age spots and has a pathological fear of getting rid of him.

She's possessive of him and our mom likes to tease her cruel and hide the bear and tell her she threw it away. My sister always gets incredibly upset and cries, leading me to take the bear from mom and give it back. I've asked mom to stop hiding the damn bear multiple times but she thinks it's funny and harmless, constantly asking my sister what's gonna happen when she goes to college next fall and has a roommate who makes fun of her for having a teddy bear at 18.

Anyway, I've gone up to use the bathroom at various points during the day and night over the last few months and I've seen her kissing her teddy bear several times. It's really starting to concern me. She has a boyfriend, one might think she'd rather kiss him. I don't think this is weird or degenerate but I'm worried about her, I don't know what this means. So  day before yesterday I waited until my sister had gone to bed and so had mom and I talked to my dad about it. Next thing I know he woke mom up and they were in sister's room screaming at her and calling all sorts of mean names. Mom took the bear and threw him away. Away away. That bear is never coming back. And my sister is absolutely despondent. She came into my room the night it happened, tearful and asked me why I told them.

AITA for taking away my misbehaving sons room?,"To start, I want to say I love my son, and I always will no matter what. But out of all of his siblings, (he has five) he gives me the biggest struggle of them all.

So, what led up to the room being taken away? His rebellious behavior started around 14, he has always been stubborn but it turned into just being flat out rude to everyone. He even gave me, his own mother, the middle finger while we were doing chores for Christmas. Later, he confessed he did this because depression made him angry, but he stays in his room all the time, doesn’t eat well, sleep well, so of course he’s depressed. After that, it’s been sort of a downward spiral.

When he was around 16, he started acting differently. Instead of being cold, he started being distant. It was like he was trying to escape our family every chance he got. He never said he loved us, never asked us questions, never interacted with us unless we made him. It got so bad that by the time he turned 17, I knew something had to be up, so I looked on his computer. Lo and behold a post on some subreddit about how he was scared he would be kicked out of the house if his parents found out he was gay.

I was heartbroken to say the least, which is why me and my husband sat him down for a long talk about it. We signed him up for counseling with an ex-gay ex-trans christian counselor, so he could talk to someone who understood his problems, but he still resisted us every step of the way. Sleeping in, being rude to us constantly, never coming out of his room, it was too much for too long. 

Now he’s moving away off to college (which we are helping pay for) in a month, and his behavior still hasn’t improved, so when he slept in until 12 the other day, we told him to have all of his stuff downstairs by the end of the day. He had to go to work, but when he came back he practically through a fit. We told him all the reasons why, how we felt as his parents, and what he needed to do in the future and all he did was stare at the wall without moving. Going off wherever in his own head, I don’t even know how to help him anymore.

I know this might sound abrupt, but he has been mistreating our entire family for four years. At some point, I had to draw the line. I just don’t know what goes through his head, we are almost polar opposite people at this point.

Yesterday though, I found a receipt. The night of our fight, he apparently cut himself, and went to the emergency room for stitches. He didn’t bother telling us, I probably would have never found out if I didn’t find the receipt. I don’t even know what to think anymore, I can’t think clearly from just my one point of view, which is why I’m asking for other opinions. I love my son, but I just don’t understand him, AITA? Also, I’m in a bit of a rush right now, might have left out some details, please ask if you have any questions.

So after reading all of these comments, I see asking for an opinion here was foolish. I am not a “troll”, and I am certainly not abusive. It is greatly troubling to see how many people jumped to conclusions, and accused me of being a bad parent. I have been nothing but patient with my son, clearly no one here understands that.",Asshole
AITA for wiping out my son's gaming hard drive?,"My son has been obsessed with video games for as long as I can remember. Gets home from school - into room to play video games. Fun outing with the family? Nah - video games. It's annoying and getting older and older day by day. 

He's been slipping in school and I believe it's a result of non stop game playing. His mom and I warned him if he didn't step it up there would be consequences. 

Of course that went on deaf ears, today I got a call from his teacher saying he got kicked out of class and has been disruptive and inattentive. I was furious. I've had enough of it. 

I took his ps4 and instead of just taking it or destroying it I factory reset it. Wiped all the memory. When he got home from school today he went straight to play video games of course. You could hear the what the fuck from his room. There was a bunch of noise before he comes storming to find me. 

""Dad did you mess with my ps4??"" 

I told him yes, his teacher called saying he was still misbehaving so I wiped everything off of it. 

My son's reaction would lead you to believe I killed his pet dog. I'm not exaggerating, I can't even put into words how flagrant his reaction was. I have never seen him so mad before in my life. He's claiming thousands of hours of data from all his games are gone now and I don't understand how much time and effort I just cost him.

AITA for walking out of first aid class?,"Hey holy jury of reddit, finally have a scenario of my own. Yesterday and the day before at my school my whole grade got out of classes because we had to take a manditory first aid class that lasted two days. Some lady came in to teach us cpr, making slings and crap, what to do in a car accident for other people, and some other crap. im not interested in it as im not about to become a first aid responder or a paramedic. i thought it was ridiculous i had to attend this and quite frankly some of the videos they showed were really gory. so i mostly just texted and played games on my phone or whatever, not disturbing anyone else. The lady called me out and told me to put my phone away. i ignored her and kept messaging my friend. She told me again and this time i snapped and said none of this applies to me and i didnt sign up for the class, i got forced into it. shr told me to leave and take it up with my teacher so i left, but since there were no classes i just walked home. my  parents are pissed and my friend said i was embarrassing. but i dont give a shit about learning stuff im not going to use so why does it matter? aita? also SHE was the one who said to leave so i was just doing what she said",Asshole
AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for not defending me when his friends made fun of me?,"We went out drinking with a few of my boyfriend’s friends. Its a friend group he’s had since highschool and it consists of 3 guys (including my boyfriend) and 2 girls. He used to date one of the girls.

My boyfriend never referred to it as “dating”. He said that they were ‘basiclly friends that occasionally made out’. He said that there never were feelings on either side and that it was a mutual decision to break up.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half. I don’t generally hang out with his friends because I feel out of place (they’ve known him for way longer than I have).

His friends were having a conversation about sex appeal. My boyfriend doesn’t actually talk much, so he was just listening in on the conversation, not really contributing to it.

One of the guys made a comment like “I’ve never met a cute girl that doesn’t have sex appeal.”

My boyfriend’s ex disagreed and said something about how “cute doesn’t equal sex appeal”, and she used me as an example. She said,”Like OP is hella cute, but she doesn’t have the sex appeal to match”. She definitely said it as a joke, but it still upset me.

My boyfriend chimed in and all he said was “Well, I think she has plenty of sex appeal.” And everyone kind of just laughed it off.

I was kind of put off for the rest of the night. My boyfriend saw that I wasn’t really enjoying myself and asked me if I wanted to leave early. I took him off on that offer and we went back to his apartment.

As soon as we got inside, he asked me if something was wrong. I initally said no and he asked if I was sure. I told him that the thing his ex said kind of upset me.

He asked me if I wanted him to talk to her about it? I told him no and that I wish that he had defended me. He told me that he kinda did and I told him that he “kinda didn’t”. 

He apologized but then he told me that it was just a distasteful joke. He said that he didn’t think that it was a big deal and he’s sorry for not thinking about how I would’ve felt about it.

I exploded on him and called him insensitive, which he was being. I’m sure he thought that it was dumb that I was upset about it, even if he hadn’t said / indicated it. 

I told him that he was just sucking up to his ex girlfriend and trying to get back into her pants.

He said that wasn’t the case. I told him that I didn’t cafe and I told him to get out.

He did, and a few hours later I got a call from his ex. She apologized for what she said and then explained that it was a joke, and that she didn’t think that I would take offense to it. 

She then told me that I “couldn’t really kick him out of his own apartment” and I told her to fuck off, and I hung up.

My friend told me that it was just a harmless joke, and that I was being a jerk about it. I don’t think that I am.

AITA for being annoyed at my best friend for breaking our marriage pact?,"My best female friend and I have went to elementary, middle, and high school together. We never dated each other since we would rather be best friends for life. We dated other people in high school and that never impacted our friendship. When we were 22 and single, we thought it would be fun to make a pact that if we were both not married by 32, we would get married to each other. We got that idea from a foreign film we saw together. 


We talked about this pact often until she got married when she was 28, had a kid and got divorced two and a half years later. I have had several short-term relationships. I turned 32 in September and her birthday was yesterday. I called her to say happy birthday and mentioned our pact. She said she isn’t ready for this much commitment yet. She talks about her daughter and being busy with work. I told her that I like her daughter and don’t mind taking her in as my own and I’ll give her as much time as she needs, but she told me to please just drop this discussion. 


I got a bit annoyed and asked her what was the purpose of this pact if we are not going to honor it. She says it’s a lot different never having been married than having been married and divorced, that I would never understand her reservations. She says if and when she’s ready to discuss our marriage pact, she will. I told her that’s fine and wished her well. In the meantime, I’m not expecting much out of this marriage pact and will keep dating and finding the one for me.",Asshole
AITA for leaving a $0 tip after waitress “paid it forward” for our meal?,"I went out to eat with my wife last night. The service was slow and our order came out wrong. We were nice to waitress who corrected it but she took all night on refills etc. 

We got to talking towards the end and had some nice conversation with her. When our check came, she said she paid for our bill out of her own pocket. I insisted I pay her back for it but she refused and told me “Merry Christmas”. I told her thank you. Bill was around $30. 

As we got to leave, my wife asked me “shouldn’t we give her a nice tip?”  I responded “nope- she paid for a meal we didn’t ask her to, and I am not paying for a nice gesture”. 

My wife very hesitantly walked out with me and remained silent in the car. When we got home she said she felt weird about it and I told her that people who give should not expect return. It turned into an argument and she told me I was greedy and I coerced her into not giving her a tip. AITA? I still feel like I did nothing wrong. Especially since our service wasn’t great.

AITA For leaving my nephew and niece by themselves at a playground?,"Not sure if I (28M) am going insane or not as I don't see this as a big deal, but my sister is pissed off at me and I wanted to post this here to see if I was in the wrong.

I don't often babysit my nephew (9) and niece (6) but my sister had somewhere to be and couldn't get her usual babysitter. She asked me and since I had the day off and enjoy seeing them, I said yes.

I took them to a local park and got a call from work about an issue and they wanted me to go in today. They told me I could go in at night as it wasn't an urgent issue, but I would likely not get a lot of sleep so I figured I'd go now.

I told my nephew that I had to go to work for a little bit but that he could stay and play, and I also emphasized ""watch over your niece."" My nephew is a very responsible kid so I trusted him. And there was a lot of people/kids at the playground too.

I get to work and the issue turns out to be more complex than I anticipated and it took me about 2.5 hours to resolve. Afterwards I get back to the playground and most people had left, but my niece and nephew were still there fortunately.

On the way home we spoke and they made a couple of friends and seemed like they had a good time. Later when my sister asked how did everything go, she went apeshit when I told them I left them alone. She told me what I did was irresponsible, which I don't understand because when we were kids we were left alone a lot.

She berated and was yelling at me and I got defensive and told her ""when you decide to stop being a bitch and calm down, then maybe we can have a more civil conversation about this."" 

I simply couldn't talk to her because she was barely letting me get in a word edgewise. So that's my story, just want to see if I was an asshole for leaving them alone.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to talk to my son because he wouldn’t drop something I told him to drop?,"Throwaway. 

My son is 11 years old, and we are currently visiting a foreign country with him, my husband, and my 15 year old daughter. 

Earlier today, we were walking to a restaurant. I saw a shortcut through an alleyway. There were some teenagers in it, but it didn’t look like they were smoking or doing anything shady, just hanging out. 

My husband, daughter and I went through, when I noticed my son wasn’t with us. We rushed back to where we entered, and found him standing there. 

I asked “what are you doing?” And he said “I didn’t know what you guys were doing”. He kept evading the question, until my husband finally said “just give us a straight answer.”  My son said “I thought you were going to... mess with them”. We asked why, and he said that our daughter had made a mischievous face before going in. 

I was insulted. I couldn’t believe he actually thought we were going to “mess with” some teenagers. I stormed off, yelling at everyone else to “keep up”. I was pissed. But I got over it. 

In the restaurant, my son still looked sullen. I whispered to him “it’s all in the past. It’s okay”. But he still looked like he was about to cry. 

I walked out of the restaurant early. I couldn’t handle the looks everyone was giving us. The three older people with the crying kid, it looked like we had done something terrible to him. 

He came out next. He said “hey”, but I couldn’t look it him. I walked over to a nearby area. He went back inside. 

They came out, and we drove to our AirBnB. He kept trying to talk to me, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t believe he put us in such a position. When he realized this, he started crying. 

My husband tells me that I need to get over myself. But I’m so angry at my son, I don’t know what to do. Did he really think we were going to mess with some teenagers?",Asshole
WIBTA if I contact the preschool’s director and ask them to “quarantene” a family who’s currently on vacation in Thailand?,"First time I post here. On mobile. English not my native language.

From the title you get more or less the whole idea of the post.
A family from my son’s preschool is currently vacationing in Thailand, which is the 2nd most effected country by the corona virus. They will be back from their holiday mid next week and they will be off till week after. The corona virus has an incubation period between 5 to 14 days.

Now, I have a very vivid imagination and  grew up with apocalyptic movies. Plus I am expecting my second child, and I feel a bit paranoid about  diseases and illnesses in general. In addition preschools are a “hub” for germs, bacteria and viruses and children easily get infected. All these results in being an explosive mixture for me! 😱

So I was thinking to contact the preschool director and see if there is a reason to be worried about and perhaps if they could ask to the parents to keep their children from school for a couple of weeks.
My partner said I’m crazy and hypochondriac (I’m not) and that anyway the preschool has to follow the state authority guidelines and has no power nor the right to quarantine anyone.
But perhaps I could suggest the director to get some information in these regards, possibly resulting into the children not allowed to go to preschool and the parents not being able to work for a couple of weeks.

TL,DR: WIBTA if I contact the preschool to check upon a family that I currently in Thailand because of the corona virus?


Edit because I don’t want to answer to all the messages.

First thank you all for the replies. I see your point of view and how crazy I sound... I won’t talk to the school administration about this. It’s true, its silly (I am silly!!) and I am definitely overreacting! I will limit myself to read the updates from the health authorities in my country (btw I do not live in the US).

Second, for all of you saying I am hypochondriac,:This is the very first time in my almost 40 years of existence that I ever been concern about health issues. Paranoid, crazy, unrealistic, very likely. But Not hypochondriac. I have very close family members and friends who are hypochondriac, I see how they live in fear and are anxious about everything and I am not like this.

AITA For telling an overweight girl she can't run with us?,"I (M 32) started a local running group last year and slowly it has become pretty active. There are about 20 of us now, with about 2 groups that run at different paces. We meet multiple times a week and are fairly tight knit.

A month ago, this fat girl joined our group with the hope of losing weight and meeting people. We tried to be accommodating to her at first but she is unable to keep up with the slower group and falls drastically behind. That's ok in of itself, but she has been asking people to slow down and stay with her. The people feel uncomfortable with that because most of them usually want to push themselves to their hardest, but don't want to be mean to her.

If some of us go out to lunch, she will always try to dictate where we should go then stuff her mouth with high calorie dishes, making her runs futile. 

So she's been a bit problematic and after a recent trail run, she ended up getting lost. We were at the finish point waiting for her. Eventually she emerged from the trail in tears saying she got lost and that ""this wouldn't happen if some of you ran with me.""

I lost it and said ""then lose some fucking weight and make a serious effort to improve your pace, your fatass is ruining everything for us."" 

She told me to stop screaming at her and I just said ""you're done running with us until you're serious about this.""

WIBTA if I told my brother his boyfriend is transgender?,"My (20m) brother (23m) is a dating a guy (also 20) who used to be in my class in school. The kid is ftm trans and has been transitioned for a long time (9+ years). The guy has presented fully male for as long as I've known him and you can't tell he's trans at all. He's around 5'9, has a jawbone to kill and grows a decent about of facial hair. However, he has not told my brother he is trans. In fact, the only reason I know he is trans is because there was a rumour going around school about him being trans, and I asked him directly when they first started dating, in which he confirmed he was but he hates talking about it. 

He and I had a conversation in which the bf said that he saw no need to tell my brother he's trans, as it's not like they're ever going to have biological children together, and he hasn't had to come out since he was like 11 as he has always been lucky enough to pass for male very well. He has had bottom and top surgery. He is also covered in tattoos, and his scars are very hard to see (I saw him shirtless at a graduation pool party a couple years ago). 

I know it's not my business to tell my brother, but he made it clear he is not going to tell him. I feel like this is important knowledge medically, and because I just feel my brother has a right to know. I don't think it would change my brother's opinion of him whatsoever, but I know he might be upset that his bf didn't tell him himself.

AITA for fighting with my girlfriend's parents for grounding her?," Ok let's try this again, maybe without the name calling comments this time.

My  girlfriend of three months lives with her parents and is still  finishing up school. I used to pick her up after school a couple  times a week and we'd go hang out at my place or grab something to eat  etc.

Well apparently she was lying  to her parents that she was with her girlfriends when she was actually  with me. They found out (through one of her friends apparently) and  grounded her. On top of that, she is forbidden from seeing me, which I  think is totally out of line and unfair. I called their house and spoke  to her mom on the phone. Mom's tone was extremely rude and threatening,  so I kind of lost my temper and gave her a piece of my mind, raising my  voice more than I would have liked. I told her how unfair the punishment  was, and how her daughter was going to resent her for being overly  controlling and manipulative. She ended up hanging up on me, and no  matter how many times I called again they would not pick up.

I  feel bad for letting my emotions get the best of me on the phone, but  at the same time I think her parent's actions warranted pushback. My  girlfriend is pretty reserved and shy so I know she will not stand up  for herself to her parents. Am I the asshole here? Do I try approaching  her parents again with a more level head, maybe in person? I am very  upset at the prospect of not being able to see my girlfriend anymore",Asshole
AITA For telling our friend group that my best friend is gay and throwing a coming out party for him?,"My (28M) best friend whom I have known for several years recently came out to me.

He also told me that he's still very scared of telling our mutual friends that he's gay and is hesitant to do so. Now I've known our mutual friends A LOT longer than he has (I was the one that introduced my gay friend to them) and I can 100% say they would completely accept him. But I do understand my friend's perspective as he hasn't known them as long.

I decided the best way to make him feel at ease was to throw him a party celebrating him coming out. I told all of our mutual friends that he's gay and as expected, they were supportive. At my apartment, I gathered any of my friends that were free and we had a mini get together. 

I asked my gay friend if he wanted to hangout and play some video games, as we sometimes did. He agreed to come over, and when he arrived, I opened the door and everyone cheered for him. At first he was confused but after I told him we were all celebrating him coming out and that there was no shame in it, he got very quiet. After maybe 20 minutes when the initial surprise wore off, he told me he had to get something from his car, and he never came back.

I texted him what was wrong but he didn't respond for a few hours, and he basically said I embarrassed him. I told him the point of the party was to show there is no reason to be embarrassed but he called me ""horrible"".

AITA for how I treat my son?,"So, I'm a mother of two. (19F) and (16M). My son has always been a very well behaved kid, but he's been off recently. He has been diagnosed with anxiety & severe depression, but I think that his psychiatrist is overdramatic.


Recently, he: 1. went to the ER because he was having trouble breathing and swallowing. His sister called the hospital & brought him in on their recommendation. I asked her if he was just being dramatic, but she snapped at me & ignored my advice to wait. My son gave me the cold shoulder as well.

2. He got in a minor accident. He didn't pull over when I called him because he ""assumed it was an emergency"" since ""I called and immediately started yelling."" So he was distracted, & swerved to avoid hitting a dog. He said he'd pay for the car, but I refused to talk to him about it because I didn't want to yell.


He told my husband that he was stressed, having severe depression, & was thinking about inpatient. My husband & I agree that that won't help him. I asked if his friends were the problem, but he got defensive & said it wasn't their fault. I pointed out that nothing in his life should be stressing him out. He doesn't have a hard life & he doesn't tell us when something is wrong because ""we stress him out"" & ""make it worse."" He has mentioned having issues recently, but didn't make it clear that it was a big deal. 


He's been talking this year about moving out. He's graduating early, but I don't think he can & have discouraged it. He has never gotten below a B, but if he's already stressed, then I don't see why he would graduate & move out early. 2 of his friends are graduating, & he mentioned that he would probably stay over at their place a lot next year, which I also discouraged & told him that I wanted to see him. I've mentioned several times about my nostalgia for how he acted when he was younger, & how I don't want him moving out, but he gets all quiet & says he was so well behaved because he was ""extremely depressed"" as a child & ""had no friends."" 


He's made comments implying that he doesn't care about family bonds & has trouble getting close to people. He's said that he feels more for the people he chooses to be close to than for family he's forced to be close to. It's really upsetting to me & we've argued after he says that he doesn't want to be around his extended family. He's never said that he doesn't want a strong relationship with me, but when asked, he did say that if I estranged myself from him, he would cut me off. (I asked this because we were discussing my relationship with my mother)


So AITA here? I feel like our relationship is crumbling. He's accused me of brushing off his mental problems, & is shutting me out ""for his own sake."" But I don't think they're as big of a deal as he makes them out to be, & he brings them up out of the blue. I heard him telling his friend that I ""gaslight"" him about his issues as well, but I don't feel like that's the case? It's not like I'm intentionally downplaying the things he says.",Asshole

AITA for punishing my son for using cigarettes nearly 2 years ago?,"

UPDATE: My son and I talked and I’ve decided not to punish him. We went out for dinner and had a long talk where he said he forgives me. Thank you Reddit for helping me out!

Hey Reddit, I am at a complete moral dilemma right now and I could use some outsider input.

My son (16M) for the most part has been a great kid. He’s done well in school and is the team captain of his basketball team. However, I’ve caught him doing some troubling stuff such as drinking underage or making out with a girl.

Recently, my son came to me and told me he’d like to get something of his conscience. He proceeded to explain how 2 years, he used to smoke cigarettes quite often before quitting because he realized how harmful it was for you. He told me that he’s kept this bottled up for a while and feels bad about hiding it from me.

I thanked him for being honest, and told him that he was grounded for the remainder of the year. While he was honest with me, he had lied to me in the past about what he was doing and who he was going out with. I also think I need to hammer home the concept that cigarettes are not something to mess with and can seriously affect your life.

He started screaming at me about how he had done this while he was a child, and how he was completely honest with me so he shouldn’t be punished. After cussing at me for a while, he stormed up to his room and hasn’t even looked at me since.

I am extremely torn on what I should do here. I do believe that smoking cigarettes deserves some sort of punishment, but on the other hand, I don’t want to destroy the trust between my son and I. My entire family is conflicted on what I should do. My wife, MIL, and FIL are all telling me to not hold his past mistakes against him. On the other hand, my parents are telling me to punish him to really drive home the message that this will not be tolerated in this household.

I told her that she can wear make up to make her dating pool larger, that she looks plain and maybe that’s why she doesn’t catch the attention of guys. She bursts into tears even more and accuses me of calling her ugly. I tell her she’s not ugly (she really isn’t) and explain that she just needs to stand out more. I told her that she can get her eyebrows done and she has some hair on her face that she can get laser surgery done on. 

She told me her friends don’t wear make up and that they all have boyfriends so that she’s not going to wear make up to impress a man, and wants someone to love her for how she looks naturally and I agreed that’s fine.

"AITA for ""making"" my girlfriend kiss my sister?","Note: I hope this is not viewed as a ""relationship"" question, since it is a conflict that everyone seems to be pretty split on who the asshole is in the situation, so I felt this sub was the best place.

I have a very affectionate family, and we have always kissed on the lips (just a peck of course) to say hello and good bye after time apart. About a month ago I introduced my girlfriend to my family, and kissed them all as usual. She gave them all handshakes, and I thought it was odd she didn't at least go in for a hug but didn't think much of it.

Later that night she called me out for it being ""weird"" that I kissed my family. I countered that she doesn't show physical affection enough. A few days ago we were going to see my family again (her second time), and I told her that it is important to me that she greet my family the same way that I do. My family's traditions/customs are important to me, and I could tell they were a bit offended when she just offered her hand.

She thinks it's ""bizarre"" that I want her to kiss my family, whereas I am saying that I just want her to partake in my family customs and in a sense she is offending me. She ended up refusing to come. My family agrees that she is TA, but some of my friends think it's weird and rude to impose my customs on her, and that I am TA.

My daughter is now 17 and we've been having behavioral problems with her. She's been acting like a brat, for her birthday we got her a laptop but she said it wasn't the right one she wanted and didn't talk to us for days.

Since then, my daughter didn't listen to my warning. She stayed out late, cursed at me and her mother, etc.

So on Monday I took Sammy to a shelter and gave him up. When my daughter came home she asked where Sammy was and I confirmed he's gone.

""Oh that weird girl!"".) It's also important to note - Lexi has never had a serious relationship. She went out on a few dates with a guy when she was 17 and he kissed her; that was it. It's also important to note that growing up - Lexi was that girl the rest of the class would set up pranks about the popular guy asking her out; and then rejecting her in front of the entire class. Lexi is also super naive and doesn't realise she's being set up sometimes. 

Lexi has recently been talking about this guy; and that she'd gone on a couple of dates with him. I was happy for her - and then I met who she was talking about. Daniel - a guy who she works with; but is also someone I know through mutual friends. Daniel has a reputation as a player and has slept with a lot of girls before tossing them aside. He has a thing for sleeping with ""vulnerable"" girls like my sister and then bragging about it. But cause my sister doesn't run with that crowd - she doesn't see it. He also has taken bets before about how long it would take him to ""bed"" the ""hard"" girls - but I obviously have no proof of that. 

So; After Daniel left, I sat down and told Lexi everything I knew about Daniel and she started a spiel that ""he's not like that with her, he's different"", blah blah blah. That he cares for her and that I should just be happy for her. I very gently, and kindly told her that she's out of Daniel's league. I told her that unfortunately she was not attractive; that she wasn't the type of girl Daniel normally sticks around for (aka, the tall, blonde, big boobs and party girl) and that he was setting her up - exactly the way she was set up as a teenager. Then Lexi slapped my face and told me to get out and that I had no right to call her ugly and how dare I say that Daniel would place bets on sleeping with her - and don't I respect her more..etc 

Now I have my mom ringing me and telling me that I have no right to tell Lexi she isn't beautiful like every other girl and how dare I tell her that she's not good enough for some boy. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for calling my ex a slutty whore on Facebook and disowning my grandfather?,"Good morning y’all,

I’ve got a really serious story and I’d like if it everyone were to remain respectful and refrain from abusive and derogatory language and be civil. . I know I’m not an angel and I’d like to know where everything went wrong, what I did wrong and how I cane improve and maybe fix the situation. Thank you for taking the time to read and comment on my post, really appreciate that. Apologies for formatting and other issues as I’m new to this sub. 


I dated a girl named Sarah for 3 years. I’m 25 now and I was thinking about marrying her. I even bought an engagement ring. She was my everything, we been through everything together and I thought she was the woman of my dreams, God’s match for me. That all changed when I walked in on my grandfather on top of her. I felt so betrayed and disgusted. I threw up immediately and I cursed them both out and forced them out of my house. They both ran out mostly naked. I locked the door and threatened to call the police as it was my property. They both called me 26 times in total and sent 59 texts  or so. I ignored them all. Next day I called her and let her explain after I cooled down. She tried to claim that it was a one time thing and they were both drunk but I don’t believe her. They hung out way too often at my house alone. I feel like an idiot for not connecting the dots earlier. My grandfather btw is only 57 and is in decent shape, looks like he’s in his 30s so he’s not some old geezer. 

I cut both of them out of my life entirely. My ex made a Facebook post about how I “betrayed her” over a silly mistake and that I should be forgiving and our love is unending and that I left her outside naked (she had her bra on so not entirely) and had a car.

I responded back saying our love would be unending if she wasn’t a cheating scumbag slutty whore who fucked my grandfather and how today I lost 2 of the most important people in my life. The whole family and really our entire community (we live in a town of 3000 people) found out about it. Most of them have shunned my grandfather and my ex while some have shunned me. They say I shouldn’t have outed then and should’ve ignored her post while others congratulated me for defending myself against defamatory and slanderous remarks and not tolerating degeneracy. My grandmother is heartbroken by all of this and so is the rest of the family, none of whom sided with my grandfather so he has nobody. My ex’s friends though have harasssed me non stop to the point I had to get my phone number changed and set my social media accounts to private.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my girlfriend to just let the dog on the damn bed?,"Throwaway because she knows my main. 

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years, & it's been pretty smooth so far except for this. At the beginning of our relationship, she told me she's mildly allergic to dogs & also was afraid of them. I have a dog, a sweet whippet/beagle mutt I rescued. I've had her since before I even met my girlfriend, and I love them both equally. I asked her if having a dog would be a problem, and she assured me that we could compromise and that she'd never, ever ask me to get rid of my dog so I figured it'd be fine. 

Well, she's moved in now after 3 years; we're really happy in our sleepy little town. She has her own room so she has somewhere to be away from my dog, but recently she's been hinting that she'd like me to sleep in her bed with her so we can cuddle and be close, and that she misses it (I would sleep in the room with her when she first moved in, but my dog whines at the door because she has separation anxiety so I stopped and slept in my room instead). To be clear: we're both fine with not sleeping together all the time, she tosses and turns in her sleep and I'm a light sleeper so it's the best solution. Anyway: 

I told her I would sleep in the room with her if my dog could at least sleep in the room as well, or else she'll whine and keep me up. She wasn't a fan of the idea and asked if my dog would knock her collections of stuff over (she's a magpie and loves collecting stuff to display, and my dog jumps around a lot) and I assured her she wouldn't, so my girlfriend reluctantly allowed her in. All was forgotten when we wound down for sleep, and I let my dog into the room. She immediately jumped on the bed, and my girlfriend yelled at her to get off the bed. I told her she's used to sleeping in the bed with me and I thought she knew that, but my girlfriend insisted that she has to sleep on the floor. 

I told my girlfriend that wasn't gonna happen (mostly because my dog would crawl into bed anyway) and walked out of the room to sleep in my room instead. We woke up and she's mad at me, telling me I didn't even try to compromise, that I walked out instead of talking, and only wanted it ""my way"" but I think she's the one who isn't compromising about my dog. 

Any extra information that might be relevant: She treats my dog well, always keeps to the proper training bits I taught her and uses the commands my dog knows. She hardly ever yells at the dog, only when she starts jumping on her and I can't fault her for that because she's afraid of dogs. She takes my dogs for walks in the mornings because she wakes up early, even though she asked that she not be responsible for her at all. 

tl;dr Girlfriend wanted to cuddle, but my dog whines at the door so we let her in. Girlfriend mad because dog wants to sleep on the bed and I walked out so there wouldn't be a problem",Asshole
AITA for telling a co-worker to f*ck off after I told them I don't want to talk about work stuff during my unpaid lunch?,"So I was taking my lunch break at my work's break room when my co-worker stopped by my table to discuss the upcoming presentation we have to give for our project. I told him it can wait until after I'm done eating and we'll have a team meeting to catch him up on what he missed (he was on sick leave for a week).

He insisted on asking me questions and started showing me work related stuff on his laptop. I told him I don't want to talk about, much less think about work during my lunch break but he persisted. So I sorta raised my voice and yelled at him to stop.

He finally stopped babbling and obviously dismayed about it. I told him he better walk away now or I'm going to have to report him for harrassment. He let out an exasperated sigh and told me that I didn't have to be an asshole about it. Then I responded, ""if I was trying to be an asshole, I would've told you to fuck off the moment I caught a whiff of your tacky cologne heading my direction.""

He was taken aback by it and told me he's going to resport me to HR for hostility. I told him, ""fine. I'll come along too and I'll report you for harrassment and being under the influence whilst at work."" (He's a big weed smoker too. We live in Texas so it's a big no no.)

He just walked off after that. A few hours later I got an email from my supervisor that one of my teammates requested to transfer to a different team and that he's okay with it if I give my sign off on it. 

Yep, it was that dude. I signed off on that transfer request the moment I downloaded the PDF.

So am I the asshole in this situation?

Edit: Just to be clear here, I gave him three(3) chances to drop it but he didn't. I barely sat down when he approached me and I already wasted 10-15 minutes of my time telling him I don't want to talk about work during my lunch break. Based on the initial reaction from y'all, I guess three chances is nowhere near enough and that I should be a saint and waste my break just to humour the other guy.

Edit2: so someone said to put [myself in their shoes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dp0ftp/aita_for_telling_a_coworker_to_fck_off_after_i/f5rtu0m?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Here's my response to that:

>Thats the thing though. I divided and delegated his duties to the other team members so he didn't have to be backlogged. We have a summary ready for him to read and the team meeting we're having was specifically organized to catch him up on what he missed and where we need him to pick up so we make the deadline. I told him this but he insisted that I show him then and there. I think me blowing up was warranted.

We literally picked up the slack while he was gone, told him this, and he had the gall to bother me during my lunch break?",Asshole
AITA for voting for a friend over another with skin color as a factor?,"This is a story about me, my friend Mary(white) and my friend Jane(black), not real name ofcourse  We all belongs to a fan group of Anime addicts. We share our fan theories, fan arts and cosplays(dressing up as characters in the shows). Occasionally the mods would organize competitions and we would vote for the best work in the group.


We are currently having a cosplay competition, both Mary and Jane participated and both of them cosplayed as Kamado Nezuko, along with 7 others. Both of them did a pretty good job actually, but I only had 1 vote and I voted for Mary.


Jane private messaged me and asked why did I vote for Mary as she thinks she put more work into her costume and deserves my vote. I replied that because I think Mary looked more similar to Nezuko in the anime. Jane argued that her bamboo(part of the decal of the character) looked more realistic than Mary, the fabric she used for the costume was better quality etc. I then said that Mary’s skin is fairer and thus looked closer to Nezuko. 


Jane was obviously upset by my words. She pointed out that since Nezuko was Japanese,  an ideal cosplayer should be asian, not white. So the reason that I HAD to pick Mary is because I am a racist bitch. I don’t think Jane should get upset over such things nor demanding to be voted. There are other Nezuko cosplayers but I picked 1 between Mary and Jane because Mary is my friend too. In all honesty I think Mary did a better job than Jane, with skin color playing a factor, not going to deny that but I don’t mean to be racist or bitchy over it. AITA?


Edit: I judge on how similar they look from the actual character, and Mary looks younger too because she is a small lady with some chubs, and the character is 14. Maybe I would pick Jane if she chose to cosplay something that suit her(she has a very good figure, definitely look better as than adult than a child). I don't cosplay and I don't think Jane did a bad job, but if I pick 1 from the 2 I pick Mary because she looks like Nezuko more.",Asshole
AITA for secretly filming one of my coworkers?,"I work for a professional services firm as a secretary. There is an accountant working there. I'll call her Anna for this post. She is absolutely gorgeous but hates me for some reason. My name is Olivia, and on my first day she nicknamed me ''fat Liv''.  

She has never stopped picking on me, and she has actually made me cry at work before. The manager keeps her around because she's the most talented person in the office.  

About a month ago Anna went crazy in the office and everyone went to see what was going on. I never knew that she was diabetic. She was sobbing and screaming that she had lost her medication. Literally everyone tore the office apart to find her pen thing, but during it I covertly filmed her having her emotional breakdown. I didn't intend to do anything with it. Just something to laugh about every now and then. 

My mum caught me watching it today and asked what it was. I told her that it was my vile coworker crying because she couldn't find her medication. Mum went mental at me, asking why I'd do something so horrible, saying that ''that poor girl'' must have been terrified when her meds went missing. I pointed out that I didn't take her medication and she did find it eventually, and that if she worked with Anna she'd know she isn't anything close to a ''poor girl''. 

I don't think I did anything wrong. That video was for my eyes only. Just something to watch to cheer myself up after she torments me again and again day after day until I find a new job.",Asshole
AITA for getting upset my gf gets left and right mixed up,"My girlfriend and I are traveling through Australia in a van. We split all the chores and duties equally. I drive and she navigates. 
The main issue is when she is navigating, she often messes up and says we need to ""turn right"" when we actually need to turn left. She'll often catch herself, but it means that I always need to ask her to clarify when giving a simple direction. It often starts an arguement, because it feels like she isn't pulling her weight.  I know she doesn't do it on purpose, but it can get frustrating when it happens multiple times in the days. 
Am I the asshole?

WIBTA if I tell my girlfriend that her being pansexual worried me?,"The title may sound horrible, but hear me out until the end. (Very crucial edits at the end)  Sorry about bad formating. I'm on mobile. This is gonna be a long one. And sorry, I can't add a tl;dr because it's so complicated to explain in less words so it's better if you read all of it. One last sorry if this doesn't comply with the rules of this sub, if so, I will delete this.

So around one in the morning, I was texting my girlfriend. The normal stuff, sending her memes and things like that. When she says to me that she needs to tell me something. I always tell her she can tell me anything because she should trust me. 

She told me she was pansexual. At first, I was in complete shock. It felt as if all of the blood had been drained from my body all at once. I managed to get myself together and asked her a few things. The most important thing I asked was if she had any sexual feelings for someone who identified as non male. She said she had, but the person made it clear that she didn't like her at all. She said she still loves me, but somehow I felt something was strange about the way I felt about this. It made me so nervous. So I talked about it to my therapist and he said not to worry about it that much, and that it'd be fine. I still feel very nervous and worried. 

WIBTA if I tell her that i'm worried about her being pansexual?

Edit: Sorry. I didn't add the reason why I was worried. It's mostly because her dad. I responded to a comment on this, but I'll go farther in detail. Her dad is a little bit of a asshole. He always yells at her and stuff, so I'm really worried what he'll think if she tells him.

Edit 2: Since there have been a lot of comments about cheating and such, I'll say this here so it's clearer. I don't suspect my girlfriend of cheating/wanting to cheat.

Edit 3: This may be the last edit, depending on what happens. I decided to speak about it to her, and she is firm on the opinion that I am not the asshole, however, I still think I messed up somewhere because of my fear of being looked down upon. I might update based on both sides, reddit and her. I'll use the information on both sides to decide my own fate.",Asshole
"AITA for reporting a coworker to HR, which lead to his firing?","This is a bit of a strange post, and I know some of it will sound like bragging but it's not.

The short of it is, I reported a coworker for deliberately looking over the urinal wall, after making comments about my dick.

This guy was one of those brash, in-your-face types. If his preferred sports team had won the previous night he'd come in bellowing ""Go [team name]!"" at 8am. That sets the tone for him. Kind of annoying, but did his job reasonably well. I'll call him Tom.

One day I went to take a leak, and Tom was already there. I undid my pants, and he asked ""Dude, did you just go up-and-over? That's weird, what are you, five?""

I replied ""I don't like dragging my dick through a forest of metal""

Some relevant context: This is partially true. I also do it because I wear boxer briefs without a fly because I'm pretty well endowed and the particular brand helps conceal the outline.

He laughed and said ""Yeah right. Probably can't get it through it's so short."" He finished, and said ""See ya, micro-dick.""

I shook my head and thought he was an ass. I texted my wife about the comment which she found funny/weird (& I had a timestamp).

Over the next week, we ended up at the urinals at the same time twice. The first time he said ""Hey, it's Micro-Dick!""

The second is one of two parts that lead me to reporting him. He was there first, and when I unzipped he said ""Let's see how tiny that thing is"" and looked over the dividing wall between the urinals. Seeing my not-micro state, he said ""Holy shit, that thing's huge! If the secretary knew that she'd be on her knees in the lobby!"" 

I replied ""Fuck off, Tom.""

I was on my way out of the office for some work stuff but texted my wife about the conversation so I'd have a timestamp.

I get back, and come into the breakroom and see Tom and a half dozen coworkers of mixed gender who all looked very uncomfortable. He greets me with ""Hey, there's MegaWang!"" (he's not very creative). I stop and look at him, and he told me he'd ""Just been telling these guys about your massive fuckin' tool! Why keep that thing hidden? Katie here wants a peek!""

I went to HR, reported everything. He was fired on grounds of sexual harassment, his comment about a coworker wanting a peek was part of it.

Most people were neutral or supportive, but I've been getting shit from Tom's friends since, saying that it wasn't a big deal and that if I'm hung I may as well flaunt it and that I'm an asshole and a wuss for running to HR.

It's made my office life a bit weird. I got an anonymous e-mail in my personal inbox asking if my wife and I were in an open relationship and if we'd like to join ""an experienced couple"" that gave some rather explicit details on the sender's wife's preferences & how he thought my wife had ""tits to die for"".

I reported Tom because it was inappropriate for him to comment on my dick in any way, but the looking over the wall and then telling the office was far over the line.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I Ask My Niece To Wear A Wig To My Wedding/Not Come At All?,"I (36F) am getting married to my fiance next week. It was scheduled for a few months ago but was delayed for obvious reasons. My wedding has a black & white color theme, with all the bridesmaids wearing black dresses. My niece is the flower girl.

However my niece has fiery red hair. I'm afraid her hair will mess the photos, as it will contrast with the black dresses. I've asked her to dye her hair a natural color, or even just wear a wig, but both her and her aunt are very mad at me. So I uninvited my niece from the wedding until she agreed to wear a wig.

My family is pissed at me, even though I've explained I don't want her hair detracting from me in the photos. My fiance says that he supports me, but I'm going a bit far.

"AITA for not liking how my friends redirect every conversation into something about how women are oppressed, patriarchy is at fault, and how all men are trash etc.","Two girls I've been friends with for a very long time have recently gotten in the habit of turning every conversation into a rant about how oppressing the patriarchy is. I fully support the feminist movement and even support some of my friends ideologies but lately I've been getting mad at how often the conversations devolve into rants about hating men. 

Me and my guy friends start feeling alienated and don't really know what to say when comments such as ""all men are trash"" start popping up. The other day, one of our guy friends was saying how he doesn't like to say sorry and before he could finish, he was berated by  my female friend who said things like ""that's because you are a man and the patriarchy sets you up to get away with that kind of behavior"", only for him to try to explain to her that all he was trying to say was he prefers to say excuse me instead of sorry when he interrupts or bumps into someone.

That situation made me angry and I tried to address it, but someone else changed the conversation and I couldn't get to it on time.

I'm just upset because I don't know what I'm supposed to do in that situation. I don't feel comfortable in fully agreeing with their statements because they sounds toxic, exclusionary, and hateful to me. But at the same time, I don't want to dismiss their message/intentions but it really changes the atmosphere of the conversations and it forces me to tread carefully when attempting to converse. I don't understand what they expect out of their statements other than self-gratification. What are we as  friends supposed to do in those instances? Do we agree with these isolating statements or say nothing and attempt to redirect the conversation? It feels like I'm treading on eggshells and its mentally exhausting.

AITA for making a comment about a Jewish Stereotype?,"Throwaway because some people might recognize me. 

I was invited over the holidays to visit my wife's sister and meet her new serious boyfriend.  I didn't know anything about him, but when I arrived at there house I saw a menorah.  I asked him if he was Jewish and he confirmed this assumption.  I stated, ""I have never met a Jew before and all I have heard is the stereotype that they are cheap.  I am excited to learn more about you.""  Nothing was said about this comment and things went on great over the weekend.  

Fast forward to this weekend, the new boyfriend wanted to meet up and hang out.  I thought we made a good connection during the holidays and met him for some coffee.  When I arrived, he started the conversation calling me an antisemitic and a racist because I mentioned the stereotype of Jews being cheap.

AITA for getting angry at foreigners for their bad Japanese?,"Throwaway. This happened a couple months ago but I remember it pretty well.

You see, I’m Japanese. While I was born in Texas my family would take me back and forth from America and Japan to meet with family and learn what they said were “More important things”. I’m fluent in both English and Japanese, I identify with both cultures pretty well.

I took a trip around Akihabara to have fun with a couple of friends. While I was waiting I saw a short black guy and a much taller white guy, the black kid looked pretty skimpy and had glasses while the larger guy looked like he belonged in the army. 

They were shopping at a spot I forgot about while talking to each other in English. Then the taller guy said something in Japanese, I assumed they knew the language until they started repeating the phrases “Bakana” “Nani” “Omae wa mou shindeiru” between English words. Then they started saying English phrases but with crude Japanese accents like “Za warudo” And “Za hando” While laughing.

I was pretty close so I don’t think anyone heard them. I think they knew no one heard them. But I felt offended so I confronted them.

I greeted them and asked what they were into. The shorter black guy said “Nothing much” but I saw he was wearing a shirt with Vegeta on it (If you don’t know Vegeta is a popular character in Dragon Ball and I’m pretty sure among the “Geek culture” sphere in America). I pointed the shirt out and he just said that’s all he had with him at the moment.

Asked if they were fans of anime and they didn’t say anything to me. Kept asking and they were silent, then the taller dude asked me for directions to a hotel (Happened to be suspiciously close to a maid cafe). He said the rest of his friends and his wife were there (I didn’t believe that, tried not to let it show). I told them and asked if they knew Japanese. They said no, and I asked what they were even saying before. The black guy said something about “Memes” and “Jojokes” and that he didn’t mean to offend. Said “Sure” in a sarcastic tone.

I dropped it and what they were doing, the white guy said they were just buying video games for the night. They checked out and left, one of them whispered something along the lines of “People in Japan can be so rude”

I felt pretty angry hearing that and snapped back “Yeah and people from Africa can be so short and nerdy”

Everyone noticed that and the taller guy told me to shut up, and I told him “Why don’t you shut your mouth every time you think about saying anything in Japanese with that yee-haw accent of yours?”

I admit I felt frustrated that day. Doesn’t really bother me anymore but AITA?

Tried telling the story as accurately as possible.

AITA for having a pic of my girlfriend’s booty as my phone lock screen? Her dad and brother basically threatened me to take it off.,"I guess for accuracy sake I need to say I’m 19 and my lady is 17, this is also a throwaway. We’ve been together for about 6 months and I’m not afraid to say I’m in love with her. We are having a rough time because she got into UCSD and will be moving while I have to stay here so that is like the underlying issue from everything now. 

My girl has a ridiculous booty. Basically we ended up on the beach together last week and she was wearing the hottest swimsuit I’d ever seen that showed off her whole perfect ass and I snapped a pic of her laying on her stomach.  I made it my lock screen because it’s fire. 

Well I went over to her house in town last week and her brother saw my lock screen (he’s 15 but thinks he’s bad ass since he’s a green belt in bjj) and said if my screen was what he thought it was, I better take it off. He must have told their dad and he said the same thing to me. He basically all but threatened me and then made racist comments so I took the pic off to avoid trouble. But I put it back on when I left and now my girl says I violated what her dad asked me to do and she needs a break.  She’s leaving in 2 weeks so i told her she couldn’t do this since we needed to leave on good terms since we were going ldr and she said “who ever said I want to be ldr when I’m at college?” No doubt this is because her brother and dad. But the thing that started it all was the pic. Was I the asshole for doing that?",Asshole
AITA For not letting my daughter be a Pagan?,"My daughter is a 16F.

She has recently started practicing witchcraft at her father's and has told me about it.

I do not like this AT ALL. It goes against our religion (I am a Devout Catholic). I have told her she isn't allowed to practice it and she then tells me that the BIBLE involves witchcraft??? She also gives me things about Pagan vs. Catholic. I have repeatedly told her I will not allow her to worship the devil and that if she keeps up this contract with Satan, she will be going to Hell. 

Recently, she told me the real reason why it helps her, she has Autism and ADHD, and tells me it helps her. I told her I still will not allow her to. She cried and told me I care more about my religion than her.  This hurt me a bit. She then told me that if I believe in a ""Magic man in the sky"" she should be allowed to be pagan. I told her to get out and that I will be scheduling a meeting with the church to talk about this with her. 

I forgot to mention that I've already let her have a girlfriend, I don't know what else she wants? 

She has stopped talking to me completely, and I dont understand Why? I have had Reddit to monitor my daughter , and I've found this subreddit, after much consideration, I've decided to post, I hope I've done this right. AITA?

Ps. Yes I am very real. These are my beliefs. I really dont know how that makes me a troll. I don't know what I would gain from lying?",Asshole
AITA for encouraging my girlfriend to wear bikinis on our beach vacation.,"My girlfriend (21) and I (24M) on vacation to a beach resort. Last week, she bought a vintage style one piece which was pretty but rather grandma-ish IMO. Like it was from the 1950s. 

I asked her why she didnt get a bikini. She said she’s self conscious about her body and that she’s too skinny and not curvy enough to wear a revealing bikini 👙 .
I said that was nonsense and she should be proud that she’s supermodel skinny and not fat (sorry I mean “thicc”).

Anyways so I went to the mall before we left and bought her a couple of nice designer bikinis that she would look really sexy in. When she was at work I opened her suitcase and took out the one she bought and put in the ones I got for her.

When we got to the resort she opened her suitcase and asked me where all these new bikinis came from and where the one she packed was. I told her I bought them for her as a surprise. She tried one on and said she cant go out like that, that it was way too revealing. I told her that other women on the beach were practically naked and that she should just loosen up.

She wore one of the bikinis I bought her but she was pissed at me. She said that she felt uncomfortable on the beach because a lot of the men were looking at her. I told her they’re just admiring how tall and modelsque she is. 

AITA for helping her out if her comfort zone? If she wore what she bought then she wouldhave looked like a total prude. Like relax, you’re on vacation gurl. And I wanted her to learn to be more proud of her body. Plus I surprised her with new clothes. So am I the asshole in this situation?",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to cover my co-workers shift so he can attend his sister's memorial?,"My co-worker asked if I can cover his 2pm-10pm (most likely schedule but could be 3-10pm) shift so he could attend his sister's memorial. I don't know the details and wether or not he asked me the day of her death. 
The place we work, schedules us 1 week in advanced every Tuesday so he has known his schedule for at least a week prior to the day he asked me. Our work offers us the option to work part of our shift and have someone come in and cover the rest of their shift if there is someone available to do so via our employee attendance system online. For the schedule my co-worker is on that day he would have an answer by 4pm whether it be a yes or no for someone to cover him. My thinking is that he put in for a partial shift request but no one was available so he started texting people to ask if they can come in. Me being one of them. My co-worker texted me asking if I can come in so he can attend his sister's memorial at 7:30pm (paraphrasing but pretty much the gist of the message)
I absolutely hate this job so I said I'm not able to come in even though I'm free to. My co-worker has asked me to come in for him a couple of times before and I came in for him on one occasion. I asked him to cover one of my shifts later on so the way I see it we're even on owing favors. He messages me right after I decline with ""Of course not"" (his exact words)

AITA for scheduling my breast augmentation surgery on the day before my cousin’s wedding?,"I (20F) scheduled my surgery on 12/12. There were only two slots left before my preferred surgeon shut down his clinic for a three week hiatus. The earlier date couldn’t work with my schedule and I was free 12/12. I wanted to get my surgery done at a time where I had three weeks off from school to recover. 


My cousin (25F) has her wedding on the evening of 12/13 and I am one of the eight bridesmaids. We were hanging out yesterday and I told her about my appointment. She was upset at me for scheduling it the day before her wedding. I apologized but let her know that that was the only spot available that worked with my schedule. 


She said she had a couple of friends who have gotten boob jobs and their breasts had to be wrapped in gauze bandages for a few days so I wouldn’t be able to wear my bridesmaid dress. She also said that I would be on heavy medication and wouldn’t be able to function normally. I told her that I didn’t know it was that bad. 


She seemed angry and just told me to rest at home since her wedding obviously doesn’t mean that much to me. I apologized again and said I’ll definitely be there and function as best as I can no matter how much pain I’ll be in after the surgery. 


She didn’t seem too pleased with me the rest of the night. I know how much this wedding means to her since she keeps talking about it, and it means a lot to me too since I love my cousin, but getting this surgery at that time means just as much to me.",Asshole
"AITA: Girlfriend lied to me, and she’s upset at me for getting upset","Using a throwaway because obvious reasons.

My girlfriend and I decided to do a diet together. I’ve wanted to lose some weight for some time and she wanted to join me to eat healthier and support me. I could tell she was kind of skeptical of the diet and probably wouldn’t make it the whole 30 days on it. She seemed grossly underprepared to do it and hasn’t even read about it before the day of. I’ve done the diet a few times before and know how to navigate and plan well for it.

We started a couple weeks ago. All was going well one week in. We went out to dinner at a restaurant that complied with the diet- she found it and ate the food there and everything.

Then last Saturday, we were heading to my brothers for game night. I picked her up. While I was waiting for her to finish getting ready, I hung out with her roommate. He was making food and offered me some that was breaking the diet and that she had eaten some.

So I went upstairs and asked her if she ate one. She told me no. She lied right to my face. When we went back down, her roommate pulled her aside. I can only guess she figured out I knew because she came running out to me and said “Please let me explain!” I was fuming at her lying so easily to me that I just kept walking.

We got in the car and she was crying but I kept ignoring her. Halfway there, she asked to be dropped off and said she didn’t want to go. I told her we couldn’t play the games unless she came and she was going to ruin the whole night for everyone because she was upset that she got caught lying.

She told me she was going to tell me that night after games. I asked her if she had even accomplished any days in the diet and she said she made it into the second day and got faint at work. She said she almost passed out and her coworkers had to feed her stuff that was breaking the diet. She said she can’t afford to pass out at work (she’s a teacher) but she could just find other recipes on the diet to do or put in more effort to make it work. And now her coworkers all think I’m a jerk.

I was so livid about that, about her lying right to my face, and about her reason for not telling me. She said she was worried I’d be upset (I’m upset that she LIED but I wouldn’t have been upset that she stopped the diet) and that she wanted to be supportive of my diet and let me get through the first few days of it before she told me she wasn’t doing it. She said she was also worried we would fight about it so she wanted to wait until we had a discussion on a weekend night instead of a work day. She swears she was going to tell me that night.

I dropped her off after game night and told her I’d let her know when I wanted to talk. I texted her the next day that I loved her. She wrote back that my reaction was concerning to her. So that made me upset all over again. I don’t know what to do now or if this is concerning behavior form HER.",Asshole

AITA for wanting to help someone my girlfriend hates?,"This may be a bit long but thanks for reading. 


I (20s/M) have been with my girlfriend (20s/F) for two years. 


While she was in school, my girlfriend was bullied by someone we will call Kyle. My girlfriend is of Rromani descent, and Kyle would make racially charged statements about her, like she was poor and trashy, she got around with the boys and call her the g-slur (g*psy). He was generally horrible to her, and even outed her as bisexual in the ninth grade and caused her to lose a lot of her friends. 


I joined the school a bit late, and I was friends with Kyle. I didn't know about the bullying until after graduation and I was horrified to find out, but I still wanted to remain friends with him. My girlfriend didn't approve and wanted me to cut him off, but put up with it anyway. I kept asking her if she was willing to make friends with Kyle and put the past behind her but she said that she didn't want anything to do with him. I did tell Kyle off but he hasn't properly apologized to her yet. 


A few days ago, me and my girlfriend got into a huge fight. It was about Kyle. Me and Kyle were very close, and in the last two years of school, he confessed to me that he was a female-to-male transgender. I promised Kyle that if I had the appropriate funds, I would pay for his gender reassignment surgery as I knew him and his family were in a financial struggle. Yesterday I asked my girlfriend (who earns more) to allocate funds for his surgery and she blew up on me. She was furious at Kyle for being entitled to her money despite the fact that it was my idea, and she refused to give him anything. I begged her to change her mind and let go of her grudge and said that Kyle was a different person now, but she got even more angry. I told her that while I don't excuse Kyle's actions towards her, he was a good friend to me and I owed him a lot, she began screaming and now she won't talk to me. 


I don't know what to do. Kyle was always there for me in the dark times and I made a promise to him. He doesn't deserve to suffer like this. But my girlfriend doesn't want me to forgive him or even interact with him. 


TL;DR I found out that one of my good friends was formerly a racist and homophobic bully to my girlfriend, I promised to help him financially and my girlfriend says that she will leave me if I give him as much as a dime. ",Asshole
AITA for snapping at someone for correcting my parenting?,"I try to be as honest as possible with my child. It's a personal rule of mine. I am lactose intolerant. Large amounts of dairy causes me to have diarrhea. So while it's not accurate for the majority of the population, it is for me. I've been struggling with convincing my child to poop on the toilet rather than having an accident. I saw the opportunity while gorging on a pile of cheese to say cheese causes you to poop. I don't care about eating cheese I just tried to use it to convince going to the toilet.

Earlier today, my child gave me a hug after I got home from and I tried to suggest sitting on the toilet. I said something about the eating cheese and my friends wife (was present) corrected me saying ""cheese doesn't make you poop."" So now my child is looking at me like I'm a liar. I kind of shh'd her in a way to say ""hey, I'm going somewhere with this."" She tells me ""don't shh me."" I snapped back ""don't correct what I tell my child then!"" 

Not my best moment I admit. Her and I already bump heads. My general rule is let parents parent their child. If you want to parent a child then have one of your own.

So ... am I in the wrong for getting upset at her for correcting my parenting? I know I'm giving my child misleading information. Its working though. No poop accidents all day and successfully got my child to sit on the toilet and have a bowl movement because of that misleading information.

AITA for smoking a cigarette outside of a bar?,"I was out at the bar tonight and it was a very slow night. After hanging out with my friends I decided to leave and go home and while I was waiting for my Uber I decided to smoke a cigarette. As I was waiting, a woman I recognized as one of the regular bartenders exits an Uber and walks past me into the bar. She doesn't say anything but through the main doors I hear her making a **huge** scene about, ""that asshole outside smoking... poisoning me with his cigarette filth... kick him out of the bar"" and I hear the bouncer say, ""sure, we'll kick him out, he's not allowed in the bar...""

I wasn't even drunk...

And I was already leaving.. there wasn't even a confrontation as I didn't go back inside.

Admittedly, a sign was posted ""no smoking 20 ft from door"" and I was maybe 15 feet away in a spot that at about *every* 12:00am is *always* filled with people smoking, so I assumed it was acceptable even though I was all by myself because the night was so slow.

She made such a huge scene. My friend overheard her and was laughing at me about it but I am genuinely perplexed why someone who chose the vocation of *bartender* is upset by the nature of someone smoking outside of a bar that they work at. AITA here?",Asshole

AITA for calling out my sister’s boyfriend for peeking at my girlfriend’s boobs?,"We were double dating at a restaurant. I (21) sat next to my girlfriend (21) and directly in front of me was my little sister’s boyfriend Tom (18). My sister (18) started dating him two months ago and this is the first time I met him. He seemed a little shy and tense. He wouldn’t look me or my girlfriend directly in the eyes for some reason. He kept looking to the side or down. My girlfriend and I tried to make conversation with him, but he was kind of stuttering. 


My girlfriend was wearing a low cut top and since she recently got a boob job, they’re really perky. I noticed that after some time when Tom got a little more comfortable, he started to take quick peeks at my girlfriend’s chest. It was noticeable because after he would peek at my girlfriend’s chest, he would then turn his gaze to me and then my sister, I guess trying to see if we have noticed his peeking. 


After the tenth peek or so, he turned his eyes toward me and I said “why do you keep peeking at my girlfriend’s boobs?” I could see he was taken aback and denied it. The girls both looked at Tom and he kept denying it and saying he was serious he wasn’t looking there at all. My girlfriend then said to me “it’s alright, I don’t think Tom was staring.” My sister said “they’re nice, I can’t help but steal a few glances too.” My girlfriend started laughing and told Tom that she really didn’t notice his staring and wanted everyone to bring the conversation back to what we were talking about before I called Tom out. Tom was more quiet and awkward despite trying my hardest to pretend Tom didn’t peek and I didn’t call him out. 


I figured calling him out was better than pulling him to the side to talk about his peeking because he needed to be shamed a little to fully get the message it was obvious that he was peeking at my girlfriend’s boobs and scare him into controlling his gaze. My girlfriend said to me after dinner that she also noticed Tom was looking at her boobs and she was sure my sister noticed Tom’s peeking too, but it was wrong for me to embarrass the kid. She thought a private talk between Tom and I would have been better or none at all because she said my sister most likely noticed and would have reprimanded him anyways.",Asshole

AITA for blowing up on a Christian during his radio show?,"Throwaway because I know just about everyone at the station has a reddit account and knows my username.

So I grew up with a bad connotation of the Church and thus am an atheist. I'm fine around religious people as long as they're not shoving it in my face. At my college, the campus radio station has various student run shows, one of which is a religious talk show kind of run by a Christian and an atheist, who are apparently best friends.

I'm friends myself with one of the tech guys for the station and he mentioned that the atheist guy was swamped with mid-terms and offered me to be a guest on that week's show time. I figured why not and hope the other guy wasn't obnoxious as I hadn't listened to the show before.

I get there and I will admit, the guy was pretty nice, albeit shy for a radio host. (I guess he wasn't used to being the sole host without his friend). He explains how the segment usually goes: he brings up an agreed topic, talks about the Christian POV then the atheist, i.e. me this time around, tells the counterpoints, and we discuss with music breaks thrown in.

The topic was religious figureheads and this is where I knew I had him. I'd had enough of this drilled into my head growing up so when he was talking about his perspective, I didn't really pay attention since I knew what we was going to say.

He signaled it was my turn and I laid into him, calling him and his religion out for teaching that figureheads such as Buddha and Muhammad weren't real and for being hypocrites and putting so much faith in the Pope.

As I was talking, he looked really confused, so did my friend who I could see behind the glass. When I got done, he said ""We don't believe they weren't real. We don't teach anything on them, but we definitely don't try telling people Buddha and the prophet Muhammad weren't real people. I can't say much on the Pope-""

Here's here I may have been TA. I scoffed and said something about not owning up to your religion's faults and he got more confused, saying he wasn't Catholic and signaled something to my friend who switched to playing music. The guy asked if I had listened to anything he said and I admitted I hadn't.

Someone else came in and ""suggested"" bringing in someone else for the rest of the segment and I stormed out, offended. Later my friend said I was unnecessarily being a dick to the host and that I should apologize for messing up the show.

I may not have been exactly in the right, but I don't think I was that much in the wrong either? I told my stance and it's not my fault I was a little off base, doesn't justify kicking me off after only 20 minutes of an hour show.

I ended up hiding it because it was going to clash with the dinner. It’s not Italian or pasta night. My daughter didn’t know that her grand brought the pasta so she wasn’t hurt. But my MIL is!

AITA for trying to get in touch with my daughter even though she doesn't want to talk to me?,"This is my first time writing here, and this is a throwaway account.

I (73 male) have one daughter (33 female). I didn't always do my best for her when she was a kid. There was a lot going on: my divorce with her mom, her mental health, my mental health, trying to move on to a better relationship that turned out to be terrible. That terrible relationship lead me into ignoring my daughter a lot, letting that woman and her two kids pick on her. My daughter usually sat on the stairs of my girlfriend's house, alone, and did absolutely nothing while I hung out with my girlfriend and her kids.

I eventually ended that relationship in the mid-90's. I was living with my daughter and her mom for a while (complicated situation, her mom was a very recent cancer survivor, she needed a home), but sooner or later tension grew between her mom and I, and I moved out.

My daughter and her mom needed help with transportation at one point after I left, and I was willing to help. However during this time my daughter and I fought a lot. She was going down a really rough path, getting into ideologies (atheist) and behaviors (bisexual) that I didn't agree with, or see as appropriate for her. I've come to realize that was a mistake, though I've never told her that.

In 2005 my daughter told me she wanted me out of her life. This was after an argument we had had. I called her a lot of names during that argument, I don't remember many of them but it was awful. My daughter refused to connect with me in any way after that.

I have tried to say I'm sorry and make things right since then. I've written to her, sent her birthday gifts, and most of my side of the family thinks I am right in doing so.

AITA for telling my (30m) wife (24f) that buying a new couch is a waste of money,"We just bought a house together and we will be able to move in in January. We currently do not have a couch and we plan to get one for the living Room in a couple months.

We were having a conversation about where to put furniture in various rooms and she mentioned that you can get a couch at ikea where all of the pieces are replaceable for ONLY $1000. 

I tell her that new couches are a waste of money and we can get a nice sectional couch on Craig's list for in the thrift store for 100-300$. We have a lot of remodels and upgrades to do and blowing money on a new couch doesnt make sense.

She says that maybe not right away but in a few years that's the kind of couch she wants to aspire to. (some background. My wife had a rough childhood and I grew up up in great white suburbia.) So she starts talking about how her mom would always pull furniture on the side of the road and she slept on a mattress from someones front lawn for 7 years (for the record I'm more than willing to buy a nice new matress)

I sympathize with her but that doesnt mean we need to buy a brand new couch. Furniture is super marked up, it's a total racket and we dont need to be wasting energy and materials (carbon footprint) for new couches when we can get a perfectly good couch already made and ready to use.

So I told her we could be really picky and walk away if it's not as good as it looked online but that we never NEED to buy a nee couch. I plan on going my whole life never buying a new couch from a store. I dont want to do it.

A made my plea very passionately and then she stormed off and is currently in the other room

I want to start that no man is to demand unearned things!

I have two(2) sons. Let us use the names Pawel and Lech. I love both my sons.

Pawel is in middle thirtys(30s). He is always solitary in life without company of women. Maybe this is not true but I have have never seen anything arguing against this. Never a woman but I know he is not a warm brother! Lech is end twentys(20s). He has acquired one fiancée. Together for many times they have for a house looked. Together they have a house found and a payment deposit of fifty(50)% I have made.  Family and children is traditional and is important to me and a house brings much help. When fiancée happened and for Lechs nameday I have bought a brand new Subabru (very safe!) for children in future to come along.

Pawel had with me aggrivated gotten. He had for many times explained over a small apartment to buy. Small home cannot have family! I say to Pawel when he with no family makes a life, then I am not in support of non-traditional choices. If Pawel does want solitary life (no wife + children) then he must support for himself. For only traditional family lifestyle I am comofrtable making support.

Let us use Example: Pawel makes work and then is sick and recovers and makes work again but to his life status no betterment. This grants no support! Pawel also argument made for not having car status in equality (over public transport he complains). After this incident where we talked, it has been since four(4) months Pawel has not talked again.

My wife makes agreement with me but my brother makes arguement. He talked that to my children I am not making fair choice. Our parents had with us fair choices made. I talked back I have my hard work earned money and that I can spend it with my values.

The bride has so far asked:

 \- For my partner to do a speech to the congregation (despite her knowing shes Autistic and struggles with public speaking). 

 \- For my partner to pay for her own dress, accessories and make up (I can cover this, but its not the point).

 \- For setting a date for the wedding and then changing it and bringing it forward (Autistic people take great comfort in routine and set plans.)

AITA for being upset my boyfriend flirted with a guy,"To get some info out of the way, my bf (23M) and I (19F) are in an open-ish relationship, as in we don't go all the way with others but we also don't make a huge deal of having fun with others at parties or sexting on Tinder. Oh and we've been dating for about 8 months.

Anyhow we went to my (gay) friend's birthday party this weekend and smoked weed there. Most other invitees were my friend's other gay and lesbian friends. My boyfriend spent most of the evening talking to this one guy about some video game. We separated for awhile as he went to the balcony with the guy and another girl who was feeling sick. Well I went to check on them like half an hour later and the girl wasn't there anymore, but my boyfriend was letting this dude sit on his lap and kiss him.

Yeah so I felt angry and embarrassed and I told him so later when we were returning home. We've been arguing on and off since then. He calls me a hypocrite because I've kissed other guys and he's kissed other girls before but now I'm angry he basically flirted with another guy while high. Well it's true I think it's different. I had no idea he had a thing for guys, he never told me anything of the kind although he claims he was just too high to care if it was a girl or a guy.

AITA? I don't think so because I feel like he's not being truthful with me and therefore I can't trust him.",Asshole
AITA for interrupting a eulogy?,"Title sounds way worse than it is. So I have a cousin, let's call him Joe. Me and Joe are about the same age, and we've always clashed. I'm the kind of guy who works hard, and I struggle to afford rent each month, while Joe's always had everything handed to him in life. He inherited a relatively successful bakery from his dad (my uncle, who died when we were 18), and he's never short of cash. He owns a yacht. I buy my clothes in charity shops, even though I work two jobs. He also has this real superior and arrogant attitude because of it.

My other cousin, let's call her Sarah, had her fortieth birthday two years ago. Me and Joe organized the party. I was on decorations, he was on food. I spent all day putting up banners and blowing up balloons even suffering an asthma attack but I didn't mind because family first. Joe on the other hand, went and ordered a Chinese takeaway. Which is one thing, but then he told all the guests that he had cooked it himself. And they believed him, which pissed me off massively. Nobody said a word about the balloons or the poster of Sarah I put on the hall door but apparently Joe's chicken foo yung is second to none? It was bullshit.

Joe died three weeks ago, just after his forty-fourth birthday. I'm so sad about it, and I wish it hadn't happened. At his funeral, Sarah gave the eulogy. It was actually a really nice little speech, and even Joe's fourteen year old son cried. But then she mentioned that party, and the lovely food Joe had cooked.

It was mostly grief taking over, but I was so mad. I muttered, ""The lovely food the Golden Palace cooked, you mean."" I said it quietly, but Joe's wife was beside me, and she got really bitchy and she said, ""Do you have something to say?""

Sarah stopped talking and everyone looked at me, so I said, ""He actually bought that food from a restaurant and passed it off as his own."" Sarah and Joe's wife both started on me, and I had to leave the church for my own wellbeing.

I understand it sounds kind of bad. But I think it is bad to lie to your family, and Joe's wife goaded me into actually stopping the eulogy. So Reddit, am I the asshole?

Edit- I don't know why everyone here thinks they are so much better than me when all I did was get bullied into sharing my feelings at an inappropriate time. Try seeing things from my perspective.

Edit 2- Just so everyone knows, I made a second throaway account and I pretended to be Joe and even though it got deleted for ""breaking the rules"", the 5 people who commented agreed Joe was an asshole just saying.",Asshole
AITA for not letting my daughter cut her hair?,"She’s 6 months away from being 18 so by then it’ll be out of my hands but until then I don’t want her to cut her hair, and I’d rather see her not get it cut for a very long time, maybe in 1 or 2 years I’ll allow her to cut it. If she didn’t want long hair then she wouldn’t have grown it. If she cut it then growing it would have been a waste of her hair. She has beautiful long brown hair (down to her hips) and she wants it cut just below her ears but that would mean a lot of hair to be cut off so she’d lose her hair that she’s been growing for years without a cut. She says that it’s gotten too long that it’s high maintenance and gets tangled and messy easily but I think when she handles it, it looks nice and there’s no need to have it cut. I don’t want her hair to ever be cut (or at least for a while) and I rather not allow it but she’s always bringing it up and has even argued once and asked why I get to get my hair cut but not her, but that reason is because my hair needs to be cut because it’s not as healthy as hers since she’s young and I’m an older woman. Not to mention long hair like hers wouldn’t suit me. But since it does in her case, she should not get her hair cut. I want her to keep the long hair.",Asshole
AITA if I sunbathe nude in my backyard?,"I'll make this short and simple. I'm (f24) renting a house with a few other girls while in grad school. They were out of town for the holidays and the weather is still nice here, so I decided to take advantage and use this opportunity to tan naked in the backyard. I like being able to even out my tan lines in the comfort of my own home. 

My most recent tanning session was interrupted by a neighbor at my door. My neighborhood has lots of inclines and hills in it, so there is actually a house above our backyard that can see into it. This woman had caught her husband peeking at me while tanning and was irate that I would be nude outdoors. I calmly told her I was free to dress how I liked in the comfort of my home, and it is not my fault where her husband does or doesn't look. She proceeded to yell at me for being a tramp.

AITA for sending my son to go live with his father?,"My ex walked out on me 2 years ago and last year he filed for divorce.

I’d been breastfeeding our son who told me a month ago he’s a “big boy” and doesn’t want to bf anymore. I was NOT prepared for that.

I felt like my heart had been ripped out. I cried and cried. I called my mom and asked her to take him because I couldn’t bear to look at him. I felt rejected as a mother. I felt betrayed. My mom told me she thought it was best that the child stay with her indefinitely and that I needed to see a professional.

I was feeling so awful that I did see a psychiatrist. I have now been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and have had a couple of sessions with a therapist.

My ex thought I was too attached to the baby and that he was “too old” to breastfeed and that I had neglected our marriage.

After my he left, I didn’t let him see my son at first. I didn’t think it was right for him to have his cake and eat it too. My mother said that wasn’t right, so I agreed to let her facilitate visits. I don’t want to see him. I was then informed that he wants to fight me for custody. Initially, was very much against this, but I have now decided that I should just let him take my son, since they both want to leave me.

My mother thinks I have flipped. She can’t believe I would “abandon” my son like this. My therapist also seemed shocked. But I’m very angry. To be rejected by your own child like that is devastating. He rejected his mother’s life-giving breasts, the body that gave birth to him. It’s like I’m a useless old sow, tossed away on a whim...first by my husband and then by my son.

I always assumed my son and I would decide together when to wean, but I guess that was a fantasy. I have NO feelings for him anymore. It feels like he’s just another entitled male who wants to throw me away when he’s decided he’s had enough. I simply cannot go on being his mother under these circumstances.

AITA for using strict parenting methods?,"Hello all,
i’m going to try sum this up as quick as possible. i (33 yo female) got pregnant at 15 with my first daughter who is now 17. after i got married i was blessed with my second daughter who is now 9 years old.

my husband and i have agreed to raise our kids strictly to avoid them making the same mistakes we did as teenagers. so we have set some rules around the house:

- the youngest has a strict curfew of 8pm and the oldest 9:30pm
- the oldest has a phone but we have enabled time limits, so she is only allowed to spend 90 minutes on instagram and snapchat per day
- neither of my daughters are allowed to wear makeup unless we are attending a wedding or other formal occasion
- their electronic devices are kept in our room after curfew
- no dating allowed for the eldest
- no locks on room doors
- random room inspections
- no private browsing allowed on devices, we check up on internet history every 1-2 weeks
- both daughters (particularly eldest) must give proof that they have done either homework or reading/writing to have access to snacks

so far this system has worked well, my daughters are performing well in school. aside from the occasional argument or two.

but i was discussing my parenting techniques to my cousin who insists that i’m being too strict and not allowing my daughters to develop a sense of independence.

It’s freaking me out that her period is a week late now so I asked her to take pregnancy tests. She did (negative) and she refuses to go to the doctor even though she still doesn’t have her period. She says this is normal when you stop birth control but I think it would be better to hear it from a doctor and she won’t even listen to me.

AITA because I'm pregnant while my best friend is dealing with loss after still birth?,"Okay so last time I posted here, you guys gave me a wake up call and some really honest answers. 

My husband and I have been trying for another baby and recently found out I am 5 weeks pregnant. We are over the moon and even though it's early days, we can't help but feel excited. 

So this is where I need your help, my best friend lost her daughter in May, she was born at 32 weeks and lived only for 15minutes. It's been an awful time for her and her family and she has struggled so much with family making it all about them and not listening to her funeral arrangements ect. I have been there for her from when she first went to hospital and through the aftermath and I truly believe her extended family are selfish assholes and she deserves better. My heart breaks for her, her partner and other child. 

It's too early to start telling people about the pregnancy but I can't hide things from my Mom. When I told her I thought she would be extatic over becoming a grandmother again but she lost it, calling me selfish and asking how I could do this to my friend. 

I feel awful because I love this girl like my own sister and now I'm begining to believe that I am the asshole. I didn't plan to hurt her and I know she may need space but I think she will be happy for me and not let it affect our friendship. If it is a case that she needs space or has reservations I will absolutely respect that.

WIBTA for reporting a classmate for smoking weed?,"Over the weekend me, and a number of classmates were at a community out reach program targeted at helping physically and mentally disabled children. While we were there, the classmate in question (we'll call them #1) was talking to another classmate (#2) about how at #2's party the other night, #1 smoked before they showed up. #2 did not know about this before and wanted know if #1 was trying to get cross faded and if they got the munchies. Normally I could not care less but we're all in a program to become pilots in the hopes of one day going to the airlines. For a little context this is in the US and in a state where weed is illegal. I don't know if I should take this to a higher up in the department or the head of the flight school we go to since they would have smoked on a Friday night and would have at least 2 days before a flight. With that, in Canada, where weed is legal, there has to be at least 28 days before smoking and flying. To me this seems pretty unsafe and I am worried that #1 may do this regularly during the week and a lot closer to when they fly.

AITA if I attend a wedding without a bra?,"My boyfriend’s (M27) brother is getting married. I (F22) often don’t wear bras (free the titty). I wear them to work, in a (business) professional setting, but if I’m going out with friends and family I don’t wear them. My boobs aren’t huge enough to where the flop everywhere, but I’m not flat chested either. My boyfriend has informed me that his brother’s fiancé has requested I wear a bra at the wedding, quoting “I don’t want no free range titties.” Their family really looks down on it and thinks I’m a hippie heathen that has abandoned God and is motor-boating Satan. 

I respect that 100%, it’s her day. However I’m trying to match my boyfriend’s attire, which is blue. I even dyed my hair to his color as well. The dress (blue) that best fits for the wedding (I have no time or money to buy a new one) is not designed to have a bra. I have a few other dresses, but they’re white (big no). I have a black dress as well but I wore that to their grandma’s funeral (so also no). I have other dresses/gowns but they’re very fancy and I don’t want to out dress the bride. 

I’ve put on the bra with the dress, but it’s terrible and more offensive. You can see the straps and side of the bra, and a tube is still visible too. Even a cardigan can’t cover it fully. It’s not a provocative dress either, it wraps around the neck and shows some side boob but everything else is covered. No shoulder, hence seeing the straps of the bra. I have a bra with fancy straps and I’m thinking about just going French style (France sees bra straps as an accessory, compared to america’s “hey your strap is showing”). 

Would I be an asshole if I just taped my nipples and wore the dress? Or should I wear the most off white dress I own? I honestly don’t mind wearing a bra for the wedding, but the dress I would most like to wear isn’t made for a bra. 

While I thought it wasn’t her place to say what I can and can’t wear, it is her WEDDING. Soooo... what do I wear?

Edit:
Here is a pic of the dress I am wearing. This photo has been edited so my waist is smaller and my boobs are bigger, but honestly not by much. [dress](https://www.reddit.com/user/kbinf/comments/cqh5ax/my_dress/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

When I wrote this post I didn’t consider the petals to be a “bra bra” but your comments are making me think otherwise. If the bride said wear a bra, and I wore the sticky cups to cover my nipples, would I still be adhering to her?",Asshole
WIBTA for saying transgender students didn't exist at our school?,"Ok so this happens at the time we had our thesis making. 

One of the groups in another section had a topic about LGBT+ ppl at our school. The majority of my best friends were in that section and 3 out of the rest of my friends were LGBT+. 

As they were reciting their title one of the panel board guests (who was our Electives teacher) said that their title was wrong. She explained herself saying that there were no transgender people at our school. She explained that the meaning of transgender was fully transitioned people from one sex to another. She was implying that the group should've used a term that wasn't directly referring to FTM or MTF but more of the term transexual which meant trans people who haven't fully transitioned. 

They didn't get to finish their presentation farther than the title which was sad but in this case if you had the wrong title your whole presentation would be considered wrong.

Everyone now thinks she's homophobic/transphobic because of that.

One of the members in that group was absent during presentation day (she's one of my close friends and also part of the community.) She had heard what happened to her group and was highkey pissed about it. 

I told her that our teacher didn't directly mean ""transgender people don't exist at all"" but that ""people who have gone through gender change don't exist at our school."" She told me she thought I'd understand since I was part of the community and that their grades would get affected greatly cuz they couldn't finish. 

Although it was harsh to shut them down so early in their presentation but if you've ever done a thesis if your title was wrong your whole presentation would be wrong. 

Even if this did happen like a year ago, I still think about it with the fact that one of my teachers is wrongfully labeled as transphobic/homophobic.

AITA for kicking our new dorm mate out and possibly making her homeless?,"There are originally 4 of us in our dorm, it consists of a living room connected to 2 bedrooms with 2 beds each. Not a big place, but we live there comfortably .


A new girl joined us, let's call her Sally. She was having difficulty finding places to live, so she was to be staying with us till she finds one, sleeping in the living room. 


As you know, this isn't a perfect world. Between the 4 of us we are very close and have always been talking about things that may offend the public, you know fetishes, nsfw, gay, sexist and racist jokes and the likes. We keep it solely in our dorm though, and nothing gets out, rule no.1. 


We have been talking more formally since Sally joined, and as time goes by some of us feel like we have no need to distant her so, we could ""convert"" Sally to become of us. Sally agreed to that idea when we told her that we were going to talk like we always do.


We were chatting in the living room when somehow the topic came to be about facial hair. Leia, one of the dorm mates, started to talk about how my boyfriend is always shaved like most asians do, saying that asian guys all look horrible with facial hair. 


I replied that yeah, maybe that is because asians evolved further from apes, then added on to say that her white boyfriend was as hairy as his ancestors and probably as stupid as one.


Sally stopped me from adding more insults and said that I was being terribly racist and rude, and I shouldn't say that to anyone, especially to a close friend. I told her that we always do that and nobody really takes it to heart, Leia confirmed it and told Sally that she doesn't care because I speak shit all the time. 


Sally did not buy any of that and was convinced that I was being a huge bully and that Leia was too afraid to say anything(maybe because I am the largest in size?). The other dorm mates tried to talk to Sally too but eventually gave up ""converting"" her and just let her think whatever she wants to think, I mean everyone is entitled to their own feelings, however silly. 


Sally started to spread news about me being a horrible person, accusing me of bullying and hurting my dorm mates. We could have had sat down and talk properly but since the damage was done and even investigations were carried out, we applied for Sally to be removed from our dorm. 


She is probably in another dorm now or worse, homeless. AITA?


Edit: Thanks for the inputs, kind of expected something like this would have happened if what we do becomes known to the snowflakes outside, it's part of an experiment you know, helps enforce it so that we don't add any more people into our group.


Also it seems like Sally is very unlikely to be homeless just because we kicked her out, which is a good thing.

AITA for spreading my classmates’ nudes to the school?,"Last Wednesday, I was browsing Gonewild and I saw a top post who looked VERY likely this girl in my calc class (for reference, we’re both high school seniors and 18). She didn’t show her face, but she showed up to the top of her lip, they looked eerily similar, and they had very similar body shapes. I texted my group chat of friends and asked “hey, do y’all think this is (let’s call her Emily)” and they said it indeed looked like her. We all joked about how weird it was because she was the LAST girl we expected to post her nudes online, but then that was that.

Come Friday, **everyone** knew about the nudes. She posted very explicit captions and pictures, and all of my (non-friend; more like sports and clubs) group chats literally exploded in her all her posts. Everything’s been since deleted, but someone made a backup, and it’s everywhere. People were tagging her in GroupMe saying things like “I can be your Daddy ;)” and “Let me see how much slut you are” and other pretty offensive things.

Son and GF complained that it’s not fair for me to basically strip away all privacy from everyone. son also pulled me aside and said gf has anxiety needs a ””””safe space”””” or whatever but I disagree on both statements. The bathroom can be used for changing cloths and can also be used as a “safe space” if you REALLY need it that badly (which I doubt).

"AITA for cancelling a date because of an ""innocent"" question?","I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks and we hit it off immediately. We even had a short coffee date during lunch break, and we were on the same vibe. He was funny, charming, similar sense of humor. Everything went great. I should add that we had sex talks as well, discussing kinks and stuff. 

So we decide to have a real date and then he asks if I'm on birth control. I think a few hours and cancel the date. He was confused saying it's just an innocent question, unlike all the stuff we talked about before. And we were both hinting that we will have sex on the first date, so what's wrong about birth control question?

My reasoning is this: if a guy is about to have sex with someone he just met, he MUST be jumping out of his way to use condom. It's a MUST no matter how many times we flirted dirty. And if he even thinks of not using a condom with a girl he just met, that means he was likely to do it before, which means he is at a much higher risk of having an STD and I'm not cool with that. 

I don't trust people who even entertain the idea of having sex with a person they don't know without a condom. I can't risk that even if he ends up using a condom. Doesn't matter that we discussed the sex positions or what we like in bed. I want to feel safe and I don't feel safe even if he thinks of not using a condom on a first date even for a second. 

Hope I explained my reasoning well. Question is - am I the asshole for that line of reasoning? 

Edit: for people who assume he asked ""to be safe I won't get pregnanf"" I say - don't be dumb please. I made it clear I want no kids. He asked because he wanted sex without condom. Or you really think if I said ""no I'm not on birth control"" he would cancel? Do you really know any guy who will reject safe sex because the woman is not on birth control? Come on. 

Second edit: for people who think that ""safe sex"" means safe for me to not get pregnant, and not safe from STDs as well - fuck off. I want a safe sex for me personally. I rejected a guy who suggested an unsafe sex. Sex on birth control without a condom is an UNSAFE sex. 

AGAIN: CONDOMS DO NOT EQUAL PILL. SEX WITH CONDOMS IS SAFE. SEX WITHOUT CONDOMS IS UNSAFE NO MATTER IF I AM ON BIRTH CONTROL OR NOT. ",Asshole

Originally, she was attending community college to take classes for nursing, but she dropped them by October. Her reasoning was her chronic illness, called POTS. 

Jane’s main symptoms are intense pain in her body, shaking, problems with lightheadedness, etc. She usually has an episode about once a day, varying levels of pain and intensity. She’s been seeing doctors and takes medication. She quit nursing school to “focus more on herself” in September.

However, since then, Jane hasn’t really done a lot. She still works at the part time job and lives with her dad. When I try taking about her getting a job with reliable hours and benefits. She gets upset. 

 Early December, I tried helping her get a seasonal job to make some money in the meantime. She didn’t do it and cried when I tried to help her make some extra money with a dog walking app.
Before you all ask, yes, she is going to therapy. However, her therapist is on leave until March.

Am I the asshole because I push her and get mad when she doesn’t do anything? 

I want her to get a job with insurance and stop defining herself by her chronic illness. And I say this because I want the best for her as my partner and best friend. And yes, I believe Jane defines herself by her illness. I told her, and she agrees. Almost everything she does, she accompanies with how “useless” she is and “stupid” her body is because it doesn’t regulate right. She’s been working on her self-deprecating behavior, but this past weekend has been a tipping point. It’s out of control. All I want is the best for her. She’s my girlfriend and my best friend. I love spending time with her, and I care about her… but she just isn’t really trying.

Edit: I forgot to add I just want her to leave her current living situation because her dad is emotionally abusive.  This is why I want her to be independent.

Edit: I swear guys I do help her. I got her an interview with a nonprofit in the area, I send her job postings frequently and help her with her resume.",Asshole
AITA for telling my neighbor he should trying having loud sex sometime?,"Alright reddit, I'm prepared for your judgement. A little backstory here. My fiance and I live in a co-op community. It's very laid back and quiet, for the most part. We're moving soon (hallelujah), and we have an upstairs neighbor, who I'll call Rob.

Rob is an asshole. When I was moving in, he told us to quiet down. It was 7pm and I was unpacking. During the superbowl, he picked a fight with another neighbor for cheering too loudly. He even threatened physical violence. I made an agreement with Rob that we could text one another when the other person has gotten too noisy, rather than slamming fists on the ceiling/walls like he did with my fiance. My fiance works nights and sleeps days, so I'm always tiptoeing, so as not to wake him up. Yet even if my dog is excited/playing around for two minutes, I'll get a text from Rob. He's extremely sensitive, apparently. Even insisted my air conditioner was too loud last week, even though it's the same one as his, the standard one the co-op provides.

Now all this, I could abide, his sensitive nature, if it weren't for the fact that Rob is a raging hypocrite. He blasts music at all hours- we're talking on and off from 10am to 1am. It's at the point where I can text Rob the song he's playing. I can hold my phone up in the air and it will tell me what song he's got on. His roomba sounds like he's bowling, he stomps, not walks, around his apartment, and yet if I do so much as sneeze, he's breathing down my neck. I'm not alone in thinking this- other neighbors have reported him for his loud TV and music. It's worth noting that my fiance and I have never been reported.

Well tonight, my fiance and I were both 'in the mood'. We rarely sync up (again, he works nights), so we're usually having sex at 10am or something when I'm not feeling it, so it ends up being a quickie. But tonight, it was at the same time (finally!) so we had at it. And for once, I didn't bother being quiet, and neither did he. It was awesome. I won't be walking tomorrow. It lasted maybe 20-30 min. And what do I see as soon as we're done? A text from Rob.'Quiet down I don't need to hear that'.Rob is a single, bitter hermit looking for something to complain about. We're moving soon. So I lost it and said; 'well maybe you wouldn't be so uptight if you tried it once in a while'.Now he's furious. I've probably just made our last two weeks here hell. My fiance is laughing about it, saying he deserved it, but I'm normally the 'goodie goodie' in our relationship and I'm feeling a bit guilty, even if I still dislike Rob. Should I have just sucked it up and apologized? AITA?

TLDR: Cranky neighbor told me to stop having loud sex even though he plays loud music. Told him he should try it once in a while.",Not the A-hole
AITA for using my friends towel as toilet paper?,"This happened years ago but the guilt still sits with me to this day. A good friend from high school invited me and a few of our other friends over to his new apartment. We had all just began living on our own at uni and he had a nice apartment in the nearest major city. It was an exciting trip for all of us smaller town folk. Anyway, the friend that was hosting is the most unorganized, forgetful and absent-minded person I've ever met. For instance, nearly every time we go out he forgets his wallet and he can never return a text or call because his phone is either missing or dead. I still love the kid to death but he's a mess. We come over, drink and head to a friend's party. Per usual we all drink way too much and the night becomes a disaster.

I wake up the next morning before anyone else and feel very sick. After the drinking and partying I have the usual D.A.D.S (Day After Drinking Shits). I relieve myself but not before I realized my friend has no toilet paper in the whole apartment. What my body did in that bathroom was almost criminal. I couldn't go the rest of the day without cleaning myself and had no other options. I had to use his white bath towel. I'll save you the details but the towel was disgusting. I threw the toilet in the bathtub and turned on the faucet to try and wash away the shit stains and smell but it only made it worse.  I washed my hands and pretended as if nothing happened.

Hours later while we collectively cleaned the apartment the host noticed the dirty towel. I was hoping he would mistake it as puke because other guys were puking in the tub the night before. He sniffed it and a look of horror shot on his face. He threw out the towel before anyone else could understand what that towel had been through. I kept my mouth shut and have never mentioned the towel since.

AITA for doing what was necessary with what I had? The guy should have done the slightest preparations for his friends and got a roll of toilet paper, right? I've thought about apologizing but I think this is just something that is better forgotten. He might not have even known it was poop but I worry he tells the story behind my back and everyone thinks I'm a disgusting monster.

EDIT: Ok I should have mentioned. He did NOT have a bin in the bathroom or anywhere in the apartment. I didn't have the heart to wake this guy up and ask for a garbage bag either. In hindsight maybe I should have.

EDIT 2: yeah, knew I was the asshole, better place for this would have been confessions or offmychest.",Asshole
AITA my mum found a cigarette butt in her food,"Not my story but my mums story.

so this all happened lets say about 20-10 years ago and my mum was out at a restaurant and about three bites in to her food she had something very chewy in her mouth and then she took it out of her mouth to find out that it was a cigarette butt and she was mad and started a scene in the restaurant saying stuff like ""I want my F\*\*ing money back"" and ""I want a refund!"" and the people that made it said that she was lying and that she put it in there! and that she just wanted her money back so it was free food. (it was only about three medium sized bites) and then my mum just decided to pack up and leave (she had already paid) and then told the people working at the restaurant that she was going to tell all of her colleagues to be careful while eating there to look out for a cigarette butt's in their food.

Is my mum the asshole?

AITA for bringing fast food into a brewery?,"So the other night we got together with 6 other friends to discuss an upcoming vacation. We decided to go to a brewery, which also sells food. Not that this is relevant, but this place just opened up and put another brewery out of business that didn't serve food, and encouraged bringing outside food. The drinks here are good but the food is overpriced. For context, it's a large open area, very much a bar setup, but with a few tables. They describe themselves as ""a craft brewery & eatery."" My wife and I intended to get drinks there, but didn't want to pay for food, so we got Taco Bell. We start eating and before 2 minutes go by, a manager comes over and, loud enough that pretty much everyone in the bar can hear, (this is a fairly quiet place) says ""Hi, I'm the manager here and I just wanted to talk a bit about restaurant etiquette. We work really hard on the food here and so bringing someone else's food is like a slap in the face. So I'm going to have to ask you to stop eating that."" After that the waitress completely ignored us and didn't even give us a chance to order drinks.

I get that it's a bit rude to bring food to a place that serves food, but again, it's a bar, so the emphasis is on drinks. Plus there was a big group of us, and most of them ordered both food and drinks. And then after the manager embarrassed us, they ignored us so we just had to sit there watching everyone else eat and drink. I don't think it was unfair that we were asked to stop eating, but I do think it was unprofessional to be so loud about it and then ignore us afterward. So...AITA?

Edit: After a lot of negative feedback I just wanted to clarify: we got the TB in the first place because that's what we were used to doing at the old place, and didn't really consider beforehand that it might be a rude thing to do. None of our friends thought anything of it either. Once we were told to put it away we immediately did. In the OP I did make it seem like we brought it 100% because food was more expensive there, but that had very little to do with it at the time. We got the TB out of habit, realized they served food while we were already in line, but decided because of the atmosphere it wasn't a big deal. I wrote the OP the way I did because I was focused on what happened afterwards and didn't consider that to be important information.",Asshole
AITA for calling international student an airhead?,"Okay so I'm 24 (female) & my family has an international student living with us. She's 22, she's an absolute airhead & I want her to stop living with us. I know I don't get the say as it's my parents house, but I'm trying to express to them how awful this girl is. So she's from Colombia & is quite religious; I try to be sensitive of cultural differences while still educating her. I don't know where to begin with my issues with her, but to start off she is boy-crazy and makes excuses for any sort of behavior that comes from men. When I overhear her talking to friends on the phone she talks about how cute some guy is & she is just a total airhead.

Once at dinner I was talking about how a guy hit on me at work which I thought was inappropriate and she tried making excuses for him saying ""maybe he's just being friendly"" or that I should be happy I got attention from a guy. She is a total ""nicegirl"" & says some things that just make me cringe. I'm non-binary (AFAB), use they/them pronouns which when I tried to explain to her, she seemed dumbfounded by that concept. She didn't get why I would be upset with being misgendered, I speak Spanish as well and I'm aware it's a heavily-gendered language, so I tried explaining it to her so I know it's not just the language barrier, she is just ignorant and thinks I'm sensitive, to this day she still talks about me using female pronouns, I heard her talking to a friend about me just yesterday.

I'm bisexual & a couple months ago I was talking to my mom about a date I was going on with a girl, this girl says ""with a girl? but you're girl"", I explained to her what bisexual meant & she tried insinuating it was a choice, I asked her if she chose to be straight and she said no but she was born that way & that gay people typically ""become"" gay when they're in their teens or twenties. She doesn't even understand that people were born gay and that they don't have the courage to come out at first.

And my breaking point that came yesterday, she has a crush on this guy from work who she won't shut up about because she is obsessed with guys and thinks the meaning of her life is to have babies and cook & clean after her husband. Well, he's gay. And when she tried flirting with him (at the workplace, which is inappropriate to begin with) he told her, and she still has a crush on him despite him being gay. She straight up told me that she finds gay guys attractive, I tried explaining to her it's fetishizing them, and she legitimately compared her liking a guy who's gay to me liking a girl who's straight. I kind of snapped at her and told her that she's part of the dominant sexuality and her sexualizing gay men is different than a gay person sexualizing a straight person, and I told her she's an airhead, has backwards views, and basically that she's an idiot. She went to her room crying and I haven't talked to her since and I don't know what to even say. I don't feel sorry but I'm worried my parents are going to blame me.",Asshole
"AITA for telling the activists on campus that I already voted when they ask me, even though I didn't, just do they'll stop bothering me, and also because they give you a high five if you voted?","So every now and then there are these activists around my college campus who will ask ""hey did you get a chance to vote?"" for some cause. In the past I've just responded ""sorry no thanks"", or ""no time, sorry"", because frankly I don't feel comfortable voting for anything unless I'm fully informed on the issue, and I don't really have the time or interest to inform myself on whatever random cause they are promoting at the time. I think the current one is something about standing up to powerful interests groups or something? Not sure.

Like I respect what they are doing, they have a cause and they are fighting for it, but I just got tired of being asked so many times on the way to getting food or taking an exam, so one time I just spontaneously said ""yep I voted."" And the guy smiled and said ""awesome!"" and gave me a high five.

It felt kind of good getting a high five I think because my brain just interpreted it as someone commending me for doing something good, even though I knew I hadn't actually done it. So I said the same thing the next time (also I kind of have to now because I can't go back to saying I didn't or they'd know I was lying the first time). And I just like getting high fives from them (got one both times so far). I plan on keeping this up, and doing this for all future activists.

AITA for suggesting a balanced diet to a man following the keto diet on the group r/keto?,"As stated. I saw an incredible progress pic posted on r/keto (it just popped up in the popular feed) - this guy lost 215lb+ following the diet and the transformation was amazing. I commended his effort but mentioned that now that he was in great shape he should consider a more balanced diet as ketogenic diets are damaging to the kidneys. I'm not uneducated on this topic and thought it was a positively directed suggestion on my behalf. Well, i got perma banned from the sub (not that i was participating in any case) but still... seems a bit heavy handed of a response to me. So yeah, AITA?

Edit: thanks for the feedback guys. Seems that the majority of you would agree that posting on r/keto was the wrong place to post this.

AITA for not accepting fault,"Back story;

I had a community health teacher who made an abortion comment in class (it's crazy how so many people are against animal hunting but okay with abortion) which in a nursing course is not okay. I reported her to my coordinator and she didn't do anything and said I can tell her myself if I have a problem. I chose not to and let it go. Teacher then later gives me a memo of concern for not going to her about the comment since I had a severe lack of communication skills. Coordinator broke confidentiality to tell her. 

SO

I have this group project and I tried multiple times to contact the group members (3 people) who never responded except one who finally told me about a meeting they were having. I go and they just tell me what I'm going to do and that's the entire meeting. At the end of the project we get our grades and have to do a peer review (doesn't count toward grade) so I give the two group members 3/5 and the other that told me about the meeting a 4/5. They go to the teacher and demand I change it. I tell them I won't change it because they made no effort to contact me back and simply told me what I was going to do so I felt that they didn't adequately work as a group. The teacher tells me I need to change it. I tell her no. The other group members start saying how they did try and contact me so I ask to see the attempts. They show me the group conversation that went on for over a week and a half with an account that was not mine. And I ask why they didn't get confused when I didn't respond and was messaging the third group member from a completely different account or why I was asking the third group member for updates when I was ""in that group chat"". The girl who had the phone and showed the conversation literally smirked and said oh. But still the teacher insisted I switch their peer review since I should have tried harder to contact them and that I was going to be getting a memo of concern for severe lack of communication skills.

I am pissed at this point. I said that if I am getting one they should be as well and she said I can't tell you whether or not they are getting one (they didn't). These memo of concerns also affect my ability to get placement preferences. I had to have a meeting with the coordinator to sign the memo of concern and she said I needed to put where I could have improved and I told her I refuse to write anything since I don't deserve it and I am not going to acknowledge this. She proceeded to tell me how unprofessional I am and how astounded she is that I refuse to accept I was partially at fault. I had told her everything that happened and she said she was siding with the teacher. 

WITAH for refusing to write anything and accept it? 


Side note: Aside from this teacher I had all my preceptors state that I had great communication skills.

I am in the belief that the right to abortion is a basic human right. She made the comment but told the coordinator that she never did and I reported her to the coordinator for making the comment.",Asshole
Aita for staying at a restaurant after it closed for the night?,"I recently moved and have been checking out the local restaurants. This is the third time I’ve been to this place. It’s small, has good quick food, is highly trafficked and in a great location. 

I walked in at 8:40. A little late to be eating dinner but there were ~6 other people sitting down so I figured it would be open for a while.  The restaurant seated me without mentioning the closing time or asking if I’d prefer to get take out. I ordered right away and they brought my food in under 5 minutes. I start chowing down. 

I’m about 3/4 done with my food and I ask for a second glass of water. The waiter told me they were about to close. I said ok, checked my watch (8:59) and said I’d hurry and be out of their hair soon - but could I still get some water? He dropped by with the water and mentioned that it was 9:00 and they were closed. I look at the last bit of food I’ve got and promise him I won’t be long. Then the manager came by. The second time the manager showed up, he’d run my check for me. I paid and continued eating - quickly. The manager showed up a third time to tell me they were closed. I gulped down one last bite and left with food still on my plate. When I walked out the door it was 9:04. 

I get that closing time is closing time, and I certainly didn’t walk in there with the intent of making anyone stay late. But they didn’t mention anything when I walked in and between 9:00 and 9:04 when I was out the door I was approached 4 times to leave, each time a bit more aggressively.

AITA for blowing up at my dad after he asked me to clean my room?,"After school, I was relaxing at home after a stressful week, listening to music. My mom went to the funeral of a relative I don't really know, so I didn't have to go. I didn't really want to go because my dad told me I couldn't hang out with a friend until my room was clean. Therefore, I chose to clean my room instead of attending the funeral, which was perfectly fine by my mom. So when I got home, everything was good, until my dad came home. I continued listening to music for a while, but then he wanted me to clean my room. He was saying how I should be cleaning or doing homework instead of relaxing in the living room. I told him that I don't want to right now and I'll do it later. He started saying that I lied to my mom about cleaning my room in order to get out of the funeral. I was kind of offended by this statement and raised my voice, saying how that's not true and he should stop bothering me. We start going back and forth arguing about this when I exploded and nearly started crying. I said how nothing I was doing was even affecting him since I was just sitting quietly and he should just let me have one Friday night without having to do something. I sit back down and we settle down for a few seconds before the arguing starts back up again. I told him to shut up. At this point he got up and threatened to turn off the wifi if I didn't go clean my room. He was yelling at me, telling me that I need to respect my parents. Then I went to my room to calm down before the situation escalated. He came upstairs and asked for the tv remote so he could watch something, but I didn't give it to him because I was using the tv to listen to music. He said he just wanted the remote and wouldn't turn it off, which I thought was bull because literally two seconds beforehand, he said he wanted to watch tv with it. When I said no, he yelled at me that he wasn't going to turn it off, but would do it now because I disobeyed him. Well, he went downstairs  and lo and behold, I heard the sound of a tv show playing through my headphones. I have a feeling ESH, but AITA for yelling at my dad and not giving him the tv remote?

AITA for flashing my roommate?,"I am a college sophomore and live in a house with 4 roommates. We all get along well and enjoy sharing jokes, pranks, etc. Two of my roommates are ""Ben"" and ""Kelsey,"" and they are in a relationship. I have known Ben since freshman year and we are good friends. We have never been anything besides platonic friends, nor do we have any desire to date or hook up (at least, I don't, and I've never gotten that vibe from him either). I hadn't really spent time with Kelsey until we became housemates, but I like her just fine.

The other day, I had gotten out of the shower and I was wearing a towel while chatting in the doorway to Ben's room (a different housemate was in the room too, but he was on his laptop facing away). We were joking around and I super quickly split-second flashed Ben. I doubled over laughing as Ben acted like his eyeballs were burning. The other roommate didn't see me but was laughing too.

Later that night, Kelsey comes home and I hear her and Ben fighting. I vaguely overhear Ben going, ""It was a JOKE! It was FUNNY!"" I shut the door so I don't hear anything else, because I had an idea what this was about. I saw Ben alone the next morning and I asked him if Kelsey was mad at me. He apparently told her I flashed him because he thought it was hilarious and thought she would too. Instead, she flipped out and started talking about ""decency"" and the like. This caught me off-guard because she and I are both feminists, and it's weird to me that she would be so offended by her boyfriend being flashed. There is some nudity that is meant to be arousing, and other nudity that's funny--like mooning someone, for example. It just seems like a really regressive and possessive stance to take. I would not care if my significant other was flashed jokingly by someone.

I decided to apologize to keep the peace. I emailed Kelsey saying I was sorry, it was meant to be a joke but that I had not considered her feelings when I did it. She wrote back saying that she appreciated the apology and that she had felt disrespected.

I'm not pushing back on any of this, and things have returned to normal in the house. But is it really that bad to flash someone who is in a relationship? AITA?",Asshole
AITA - Not helping my wife put away Costco groceries,"Going to start this with I know I'm an asshole. In this case, I also know I am part of the asshole to blame. My wife wanted me to post this because she thinks it is all on me. I am willing to find out if the majority think with her or with me.

Some background so that you realize I am not here looking for relationship advice. My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and with dating up to about 30 years. Our relationship is anything but perfect and our primary dynamic is bickering. Also I am a certified Lazy POS and my wife is a workaholic who will invent work to do if she doesn't have anything to do. So there is a rub as well.

On to our story. Arrive home from Costco. Unload the car and get everything inside, either on the counter or stacked up just inside the door. Wife starts working on the kitchen items and I start lugging all the heavy shit downstairs and putting it away. I get done with the heavy stuff, see that she has about 7-8 items left and I go sit down and turn on the TV. She see this and tells me that we aren't done and that she is still working and I need to come help. I tell her that I am done with my part (yes I know it is all part of it, but hmmmmm) and that she can finish up the light stuff. Here is the crux of the argument. I say that I finished moving the heavy things that she can't (or at least not without great trouble) move and I don't think I need to come help her with the rest. She, well within her rights I don't disagree, tells me to ""get off my lazy ass"" and help her with the rest. Bicker mode ""Engage""!

I say that if she doesn't like the arrangement, I will unload the lighter stuff, which will take longer and she can deal with the heavy shit and that is acceptable to me, OR we can do it all together, meaning that we can both start with either heavy or light and do it all together. I said that either of those are acceptable to me, but griping at me that I am not doing my share when I am doing the things that she will struggle with or will be incapable of doing are not the same. She is not on board with either of those because the heavy stuff is too heavy for her.

So there we have it. Yes I know I am an asshole already. Pretty much prepared for that, but what I want to know from the community is if I am the sole asshole or is this an ESH where she bears some of the blame.

We both eagerly await your judgement.

EDIT- Trying to clear up some things.

1. I AM LAZY! This is not from her calling me lazy. Or anything exterior. This is self-actualization. I KNOW I am lazy. I would rather not do things. This is not to say that I don't take care of my responsibilities. I am lazy when it doesn't matter. Clean the garage or play video games? Not a competition. Both cars fit in the garage. Nothing is in the way or causing danger. Fuck that. It doesn't have to be done right now. That kind of lazy. Not the snort cocaine, sell the TV and not have a job lazy.

2. Relationship, therapy and counseling - LOL. Thanks for everyone's advice that I/we need to seek counseling immediately. I tried to make it clear that this relationship dynamic is part of who we are as a couple. It may sound bad to you, but it works for us. We actually love each other. We are each other's best friend. Let me know if you never argue with your friends. Now live with that friend for 20+ years and see how it goes. Not to mention, if you haven't before now, please see above. I AM LAZY! Divorce would be a complicated, time sink pain in the ass! Not to mention I would then probably have to date and try and find someone else. Then I would need to spend a year getting used to all that person's weird idiosyncrasies. Not to mention dating and all the hassles that come with that. PASS. 

IATA -  Looks like the consensus is I am pretty much the sole Asshole here. Damn. Fine. I will help her with the small shit. (Not that I normally don't anyway, but apparently it will look better to the therapist if we play the ""he never helps put away the groceries"" card instead. ;p) I maintain my right to bitch and complain about it however!

Thanks everyone. Today my wife gets to be the mayor of ITOLDYOUTOWN.

Final Edit - Shit goes DOWN! (aka the only place

Sorry. No big drama here. Just a regular old married couple talking to each other. Here is where you can turn back to 18 and Knocked up if not interested in the mundane details of couples doing normal couple shit.

She comes around the corner and gives me a cool stare. ""Aaaand?"" Because she already knew the answer because by now you would know my wife is wicked smaht.

Actual husband and wife that oddly aren't just the one little snapshot we present as a little glimpse into our own personal fucked upedness (not a word), but rather a complex intertwined web of two individuals who, over time have made a whole.

Anyway so of course I told her that she was overwhelming correct and I am in fact, no shock to anyone in that room, an asshole. Not all the time, but definitely in this case. At which time we got to sit down and have a nice chat about our relationship. Which is something I know many of you will find shocking, but we do quite a bit.

I told her that everyone online (with a few exceptions of what seems to be mostly older married couples oddly enough. not odd) thought our relationship was dysfunctional and that we needed to seek professional help immediately. To which she didn't immediately respond that's stupid. (Duh duh DUHHHH!!!! Now we are getting to the juicy stuff. I knew this guy was a real dick. Interwebs JUSTICE! (Parenthetical break inside a parenthetical break? Is this even legal? Think Deadpool here. I have to explain my humor to some folks because even after all this crazy shit I have typed, they still don't seem to get it. So just dropping this off here. The previous parenthetical break was as if I were speaking in the voice of someone with a justice boner for this post and that was hoping I would get my comeuppance (<-- real word. How deep does this fucking go. Inception post)))

Where did I drop that train of thought. There it is. So yeah she gave me the thoughtful silence for a few moments before responding. I wasn't running a tape recorder so all of this is paraphrase (with my own voice since I done spent all them college years learning to write good), but she said that there would be no point because what would we be trying to solve? We know each other. She says what I lack in our relationship is perspective. With regards to us, I only have myself and I always think I am right. I need outside perspective often because I tend to be my own echo chamber. (She's spot on with this one.) As for the rest, she knows I am a ""lazy"" (man that word sure launched a thousand tirades. Triremes? Helen of Troy? Trojan War? Too much?) bitcher, as in one that likes to bitch. But she has shit about her that I have to deal with as well. Basically we aren't the exact same people we were 20-30 years ago, but we are still them. Our edges have filed away over the years. Especially the ones that bump up against one another. If I was still the same person that I was 20 years ago, we would be divorced. But the opposite also holds true. If she would have remained the same, I would have been gone (me here: Didn't you say you were too lazy to get a divorce?? Remember, if you can follow my twisted train of thought, this is me paraphrasing my wife). But we have mellowed a lot. Said that when we first got married, she wouldn't even ask me to take care of even trivial married stuff because she didn't want to endure the bitchfest I would put on.(Interactive mode back on)

Of course I wasn't standing for that because it didn't ring true. We talked about how I always had to do the appointments for our first house because I had the flexible schedule and I was always doing stuff. To which she thought and responded yes. And then after a little more back and forth we decided that the purchase of our first home was sort of a watershed moment in my penchant for lapsing into grousing. (Felt like bitching was getting played out) And again ( I really can't stress this enough) since we are adults in an almost loving caricature (you don't know, until now, but I had to google how to spell caricature. I totally spaced it) of a romantic relationship, we determined that I definitely took on much greater responsibility in the relationship as a consequence of our first house purchase. (That place was a dump by the way and we polished that turd up as shiny as we could get it given our limited budget and still burgeoning total ignorance of anything home care related.) ""You resigned yourself to your fate."" Direct quote which I thought was hilariously true. For which she determined that she was happy that it happened before we got our daughter, because if I had still been the same procrastinating, ""don't bother me with that shit"" jackass that I had been before my metamorphosis (hah. But seriously. How often do you get to use that word. I'm keeping it just for that reason alone) or acceptance of my fate, if you will, then I would probably be a weekend dad at this point. So for those of you who think I suck now, I used to be worse! But then again so was she. And to those of you that think we are self centered. You are right. We have always been jealous of our time alone as much as we have been of our time together. We found the balance that worked for us. Because we are both a bit self centered, we get that trait in the other and can work around it. See how it works? Her need to be a control freak dovetails nicely into my ""I don't give a fuck about (Insert something that doesn't matter and that I truly don't give a fuck about HERE)."" (Again, for the humor impaired, she really isn't a complete control freak and I give a fuck about a lot of stuff in our relationship.) And while presented humorously, it is also true. 
For example. She loves planning trips. I don't mean, we should go to Disneyland. Let's look for some hotels loves to plan. She LOVES TO FUCKING PLAN! I am talking binders, travel times, bus schedules, full itineraries, hours of operation for the sites we will visit. Embedded pictures and maps. Yes I am talking in the age of tablets, we still get binders. The electronics just opened new vistas for her planning. And I like to not do any of that. I know. Knock you off your perch with a feather right? But I LOVE to drive. And she would rather not. So BAM! Couples therapy avoided by getting to know your spouse. Amirite?

So if you have somehow read all the way down to here. Just know that after our nice little chat, I looked over at my wife and she said, ""You realize there is a price for all this don't you?"" And I said, ""No I didn't actually. What price do I have to pay?""

She looked at me and said,"" I need about tree fiddy.""

Can you imagine reading thru all of this bullshit and this is just some shitty meme? It's not, but man that would have been absolute GOLD, Jerry! Yep with the exception of the Loch Ness Monster at the end, the rest of it is all true. Sorry. Sometimes us folks on the internet are just folks. Sorry our fucked up relationship doesn't match your fucked up relationship. Or that you feel we are just deluding ourselves still after all this time. Thanks everyone for your concern. As you can see, my wife knows my shit inside and out. Sometimes she just gets to let me hang myself and lets me play out all the rope I want.

I'd keep going, but I think Kylie Jenner is about to reveal something about a new foundation. Can't miss that.

AITA for asking an immigrant why he haven’t immersed in American culture?,"I met my wife originally when I was stationed in Turkey back in 2009 and we got married the following year.   About 5 years ago, the military sent me to AZ and we’ve pretty much settled down here ever since.

Since we’ve been here, my wife has met a ton of Turkish people within the area.  A TON!  Some have been in AZ for several years now.  Others have been in for only a few.

During one recent gathering, I noticed a new couple that has joined my wife’s circle of friends.  So I go over and introduce myself to the husband, who I should call Phil from here on.

After brief pleasantries, I come to find out that Phil and his wife (I’ll call Kat) had been living in AZ for almost 10 years.  They both arrived originally arrived with business visas but pretty much stayed here after the political scene changed in Turkey.

So I asked Phil if he plans on becoming a citizen and he answered that he wants to.  He recently got his immigrant visa, and now has to wait a few more years to apply for citizenship (odd?).  This is when the conversation turns awkward.

Me: So now that you’re gonna be an American soon...have you picked a favorite sports team or college?  Or are you sticking to the Phoenix teams and ASU?

Phil: No, not really. 

Me: Oh, how come?

Phil: I don’t really like American sports, its too boring.

Me: you should really check out a college football game, they can be intense.  Even a college basketball game

Phil: Why? I don’t see a point in sports

Me: Oh okay.  I read someone that some Syrian immigrants who settled in Nebraska became Cornhusker fans.

Phil:  what is that?

Me:  its the nickname for the University of Nebraska.

Phil: Good for them, but thats not for me!  I just want my wife and I to be ourselves, keep our cultural roots and heritage.  Why do we have to change?

Me: fair enough.  What about a favorite band, restaurant, holiday spot, beer, or theme park? Or favorite time period in history?

Phil: Does that really make you an American? Having something that is your favorite thing ?

Me: so...you haven’t really embraced or immersed in American culture after more than 10 years of being here?

Phil: Did you take in Turkish cultural when you were there?

Me: I did.

Phil: (mutters something in Turkish and walks away.)

My wife and Kat were nearby and were kinda astonish the conversation went the way it did, but my wife did say I was being a bit of an ass asking personal questions, but I was being curious seeing our country through the eyes of an immigrant.  Was I really an AH?",Asshole
AITA for absolutely refusing to watch the special editions of the original Star Wars trilogy.,"I'm a guy in my late 20s that usually spends Christmas by myself.  My dad is dead, my mom is doing her own thing with her new boyfriend, I'm not very close with my brother, I'm not close at all with my extended family, and I don't have any friends.  Sad, I know, but it is what it is.  So one of the traditions I've developed is that every Christmas, I marathon Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (i.e. the true Star Wars movies).

Thankfully I got a girlfriend last spring, and the topic of Christmas recently came up.  I told her about my tradition, and to my surprise she was actually open to it (she's seen the Star Wars movies but is pretty indifferent toward them).  All was well until she said, ""This'll make me feel validated for paying for Disney+.""  I was like, ""What do you mean?""  She said, ""The movies will be on Disney+, so I figured we could watch them on there.""  I said, ""No, those are the terrible special editions.  We have to watch the original versions that I have on VHS.""

She said I'm being ridiculous and that she wants to watch them in modern HD instead of off a VHS tape.  I said that I will not budge on this.  Either we watch the original versions, or we do something else entirely on Christmas and I can just do my tradition alone later that week when I have a day off, which I thought was a fair compromise.  She said my reaction was immature, but I really don't see how since I offered to just do the marathon another day so she doesn't have to bother at all.  Am I somehow the asshole?",Asshole
AITA for wanting my husband to work more,"For background, we have a 1.5 year old baby together. When he was born we agreed that I would find a job that I could work part time from home for and he would work some extra hours. This was fine, but I'm finding that it's too stressful to have to try and do work while also caring for the baby. Right now my husband works 9-10 hour days.

Recently, I asked him if he would consider working more so I could drop the part time job and focus entirely on being a mother. He said that if he did that I would have to do all the chores, so that when he got home he could relax. He would continue to care for the baby some when he got home though, at least he claims. So I said it wasn't fair because I'm already working all day with the baby, and shouldn't have to do all the chores. He wouldn't budge, either he keeps the same hours or I do all the chores.

AITA for laughing at my friends calling me a sociopath?,"Me and my friends were meeting up at a bar. We were talking about HS where I used to be a bully and we were talking about how bad I used to be. I was laughing at how I used to torment this guy for fun. I also made a joke about how I was the one who made him change schools. 

After that, my friends asked me a question about whether I feel empathy or not. I laughed and responded saying that I don't feel empathy until I like the person. 2 of them said that there was something wrong with me in the head and that I should get checked.

AITA for telling my best friend [22F] who has type 1 herpes that she should stick to using std/positive singles dating apps?,"Hey!

So my best friend, we’ll call her Tracy, has type 1 herpes below the belt. She’s had it for about 4 years, doesn’t get outbreaks, and also doesn’t take meds for it. She recently confided in me about this.

I was trying to be helpful and give her advice and so I told her that it would probably be best for her to stay away from normal dating apps (like tinder, bumble, etc) because she’ll probably just face more rejection since dating on those apps is already hard enough. I told her she should make some accounts on the apps for people who are positive for STIs. 

Tracy was hurt that I said this because she said she’s tried those apps and they made her feel like a pariah and she also argued that 50% of people in the US have her type of herpes. To which I told her that yes, technically this is true, but most of those cases are oral aka cold sores.

This happened about a week ago and I can really tell that I hurt her feelings but I was just trying to be helpful. I mean, I really think most guys (at least at our age) just aren’t going to want to date someone with herpes, which sucks but is the unfortunate reality of the situation.

AITA for telling my friend’s girlfriend that she looks like a specific porn star?,"One of my best friends Toby (20M) has been with his girlfriend Abby (19F) for almost a year now. I (20M) met her quite a few times and she seems like a down to earth gal. She’s not known to be jokey type of person. I always thought she looked like a celebrity, but could never put my finger on exactly who. I told them about this, but they couldn’t figure out who I’m thinking about either. 


I went to Toby’s apartment to make dinner with him yesterday and Abby was also there. It finally clicked. I was watching porn a couple of days ago and the person she looked very much like is the pretty porn star Ashly Anderson (23F). I told Abby that. They looked it up and agreed that they look very much alike. 


Abby asked me why I watch porn if I already have a girlfriend (20F). I said it’s normal. Toby said it’s not normal and asked me if my inability to get hard sometimes to my girlfriend is because I watch too much porn. I told him that’s not cool to share that information with Abby and his roommate (20M) within earshot. 



Abby said it’s not cool to watch porn if you already have a girlfriend. She said she’ll talk with my girlfriend about this. I told her to butt out of private life. She asked me if my girlfriend didn’t know I watch porn. I told Abby that it’s normal for guys in relationships to watch porn, but that doesn’t mean we have to tell our girlfriends that and possibly make them feel insecure. 


She asked me if this conversation ever came up with my girlfriend and I lied about not watching porn. I told her to just mind her own damn business. She said she was just kidding about planning to tell my girlfriend this. I told her she better be kidding. Toby told us to chill. We did. When I left, I told Abby again to not tell my girlfriend. She said “we’ll see”.",Asshole
"AITA for having an accident on my friends blanket, stealing it and then not telling her?","I visited and stayed with a friend over the weekend to attend a wedding. My friend got sick on Saturday night, took double dose of NyQuil and passed out hard. I got bored logged onto my Grindr accnt and had a guy come over. I wanted to prevent noise so I laid a blanket on the floor (to prevent rug burn of course), the guy came over and we did the deed. After he left I noticed a feint smell, I turned on the light and low and behold there was quite a large...I guess you’d call it shit stain? What I thought was lube was actually anal juices leaking. Anywho, obviously embarrassed I wrapped the blanket in a bag and stuffed it in my car trunk (after cleaning up). I never said anything and she had so many blankets I guess she didn’t really notice. I washed the blanket and was able to save it completely. Lol I fessed up, apologized and told her and tried to give the blanket back which she didn’t want. Now we don’t talk. Am I the asshole for shitting on her blanket and not telling her? 😔

**edit** everyone got their panties in a bunch over the fact I had someone over. No where in the story did it say she wasn’t ok with me having someone over. #1 I’ve been friends with this person for 16 years. #2 we’ve been roomates before #3 having someone over was NOT an issue 😂😂 sounds like a bunch of cockblocks and virgins replying.

AITA for telling my sister I don't want to be around her when she's on her period?,"My sister and I are twins, but I am a male. Due to financial constraints we share a bedroom, but there is a couch in the main room that one of us could sleep on if we felt we needed to.

I have an aversion to blood, so naturally I am disgusted by periods as well. I know they're natural, but so are other bodily functions that people find gross. So I tried to tell her this, and just asked if she could let me know when she is on her period so we could avoid each other. I knew that since I was the one asking most of the onus is on me, so I volunteered to take the couch while she is on her period, I just need to know when it is.

She was very upset and said I need to ""grow up"". I said that having an aversion to blood has nothing to do with needing to grow up, and I'm willing to accommodate the situation and give her the room to herself so she should be happy about it.

I’ve since discussed this with a few people and was surprised to find some folks thought it was within the rights of the churchy folk to demand “modesty”. They compared it to taking off your shoes in someone else’s house.

I found that weird. Because yeah ofcourse it is more difficult to live vegetarian but it isn't impossible for anyone. I told her as much but kinda laughing it off. She got kinda mad and told me that it simply was what her doctor told her and I told her that if she wanted to no longer be a vegetarian she should simply say it instead of making something up.

"AITA To my GF for carrying a previous, deceased, Fiance's picture while asking her to marry me?"," I was engaged 7 years ago to someone I’ll call Jane. She was perfect, she was great. Great perfection. She died two years after our engagement. To this day, I am feeling the pain of losing her, I think. She was my soulmate I could say. I still keep a picture of her in my wallet and look at it everynight to remember the good time. 

Then I met Cara. Cara is great, seriously. Shes nice and wonderful. 

But I still miss Jane. Nothing, I mean, nothing, was as good. She was the best part of me. 

But since Jane is gone forever, and Cara is atleast a close and very very good second best.. I should marry that, right? I am entitled to a happy married life to a great woman.

Anyways, last week I got drunk one night and told a friend exactly that.. I’m getting old, I should get married and I found a good woman. Even though she isn't Jane, she's still a great woman. 

So I asked Cara to marry me two days ago and she broke down crying saying she can’t. She knows about what I said that night and how I still keep and look at Jane’s picture and she doesn’t feel it’s fair to her.

I DON’T GET IT, why would she feel insecure of a dead person? 

Sure, let me be honest with you Reddit (cause I'm a huuuuuuge fan of setting reality onto people ).  \*\*hypothetically\*\* I’d rather be with Jane if she somehow ever came back to life. Sure. But that's because Jane was fucking 1 in a entire universe and perfect. It's not like I'd rather be with some random woman. Cara can't seem to understand Jane is just an anomaly that she shouldn't have to worry about. 

And the biggest reason to now worry about Jane? SHE'S DEAD. WHY ARE YOU INSECURE ABOUT A DEAD PERSON??

&#x200B;

I didn't sat this next part to her but yes, Cara can’t make me feel as good as Jane did.. but Jane was so perfect for me nothing can beat. Cara should feel honored that she comes even close. 

Like I said, Jane is dead. Honestly, if you feel insecure about a dead person, then maybe you have problems.  It's not like I can cheat on Cara with Jane

&#x200B;

Anyways anyways, this got around and friend and my parents are telling me to either get over Jane or not date until I have moved on. And that I'm an asshole. Thing is, I'll never completely move on. But I am entitled a happy relationship as long as I treat the other person with respect. 

I feel like I have a right to, in my mind, still treasure someone else if that is person is dead and I still respect my future wife.

AITA for Not Wearing my Seatbelt,"My bf has asked me to wear my seat belt a few times.

End of conversation. Didn't hear another word about it, so I thought we were good. That is, until yesterday. I was in the passenger seat, his two kids in the back, he was driving. Out of nowhere, he just stops at a light and refuses to move until my seatbelt is on. Like, straight up, ""put your seatbelt on now, or i'm not moving. I'm serious, now!"" So, of course I put it on. I refused to talk to him the rest of the ride home, because I am super against fighting in front of his kids. Period. When we got home, it was a straight up fight. I wasn't upset that he asked me to put on my seatbelt, I was upset that he demanded I do so, in what I consider a controlling and demeaning manner. In front of his kids (4 & 6). If he had sat me down to discuss why it was so important to him, I would have listened. He kinda apologized, but in one of those ""sorry I said that, but heres my defense for saying it"" kind of ways, that you know isn't actually an apology. And now he's super pissed at me.

AITA for not tipping?,"So this took place 2 to 3 years ago, I met up with two friends and went to Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner, and ordered wings. When deciding on the type (boneless versus boneful) and size of wings, I asked our server about the number of wings in each order, as I wanted to take some wings home for my mother. The server explained that an XL order of boneless wings includes 22 wings, while the boneful XL comes with 18 wings. So I decided that I would order the 22 wing boneless XL for the sake of saving money and still taking food home for my darling saint of a mother.

Easy enough right? Well no, not really, our order shows up 15 to 20 minutes later with 18 boneless wings on it! Not cool! Especially true since I specifically asked her about the order size WHEN I ORDERED. As soon as I realized this I started ranting to my friends, but I REALLY don't like confrontation or complaining about my food, so I didn't mention anything. However, as we were leaving, I had to put in another order to take home to my mother. Which drastically increased my tab at the end of the night.

So, I didn't leave her a tip. I didn't know if she gave me the wrong information when I asked at first, or if the kitchen messed up my order, but either way, I was dissatisfied with my experience. Importantly, this took place in california, where there is no server's minimum wage. meaning that our server was making at least $11 an hour and was not a slave to tips, those are just extra. But the friends that I was with thought that IWTA, especially because one of them is a server as well. However, I believe that bad service can justify not leaving a tip in california, it's my way of saying I didn't like the service. AITA?

Edit # 2: Alright, I get it, while I still stand that she wasn't necessarilly entitled to a tip from me by default, her actions I described didn't justify me jumping to that decision without communicating to her my issues, and that was not the best course of action.",Asshole
AITA for demanding my employee not wear a man bun at work?,"I am the sales manager at a small chain of furniture stores in my city.  We have 30 employees working in our 3 stores, about half of which are sales staff.  The sales staff are paid partly in commission and earn a decent wage as our stores are very popular in our area.

One condition of employment is that sales staff are to ""Present themselves in a professional manner"" to customers.  This includes wearing a clean shirt and tie, maintaining good personal hygiene, and maintaining a professional hair style.  Our stores are considered ""higher end"" and our customers tend to be older and fairly conservative.

We have one salesperson that we hired a year ago.  He has done very well and is usually in the top 3 in sales every month.  When we hired him, he had normal length hair, perhaps a little on the longish side, but he kept it well-styled.  However, I noticed over the months that his hair kept getting longer and longer.  He usually gelled it back to keep it looking neat, but eventually it started looking a bit unkempt.

I finally approached him and mentioned that his hair was getting a little long, and suggested that he get it trimmed.  He replied that he was purposefully growing it out so that he could put it into a ""man bun"".  I wasn't sure what that was, so I googled it.  What I saw shocked and disgusted me.  I had seen young guys in our area walking around with this hairstyle, and always thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen.  

I informed the employee that a ""man bun"" was not an acceptable hairstyle for our employees, and told him that he either needed to trim his hair, or he would not be allowed onto the sales floor.  He sputtered a bit and looked like he was going to cry, and then mentioned something about his right to free expression before storming out of my office.

I was off for the next few days.  I assumed that the next time that I saw the employee, he'd have gotten a haircut.  Instead, when I walked into the location that he works at, I was shocked to see him talking to a customer with the most pathetic looking man bun you had ever seen.  His hair was barely long enough  to make into a bun, so there was just a tiny tuft of hair holding on to an elastic for dear life.  

As soon as he finished serving the customer, I called him over and asked him if he remembered our conversation.  He told me he did, but that it was his right to wear his hair the way he wanted to.  I explained to him that he works in an ""at will"" state, so we can fire him for just about anything.  Which I did.  He burst into tears, called me an asshole, threatened to sue me, and stormed out the door.

My assistant sales manager told me that I was too harsh and that the guy was supporting his boyfriend who had recently lost his job and had some health issues.  I feel like I gave the guy ample warning that this hairstyle was not permitted in our workplace, and he deserved to be fired for openly defying me.

AITA for asking my roommate to stay with her boyfriend while she recovers from surgery?,"My roommate has recently been having some health problems and needed to get one of her ovaries removed. I'm just going to say it; I am trans and this has been extremely fucking triggering for me. My dysphoria spirals out of control every time I see her laid up on the couch. I have taken to isolating in my room which isn't healthy. 

Last night, I was feeling very dysphoric and politely asked her if she would maybe consider staying at her boyfriend's place while she recovers and explained why. She took it very badly and said something like, ""I'm sorry if my failing health is an inconvenience to you"". Very hostile and sarcastic. We got into an argument about it because I felt she took my words the worst way possible. I tried my best to be civil and explained that I know this is hard for her, but it's hard for me, too, and she's not the only person who lives here and to stop being selfish. That's when she called in our other roommate and asked her if she had a problem with her recovering from surgery here. She seemed confused and answered no.

I think this was really unfair because she didn't explain my side of the story. My roommate then went on to say that I was the only one with a problem, so I could leave if I didn't want to be around her. I got very upset. I felt like I was being ganged up on and my words intentionally misunderstood to make me look like the bad guy when I did nothing. It was a simple fucking request. Just because she's sick doesn't mean she has to make everyone else around her miserable. I have lost words for this situation, so am I the asshole?

EDIT: So I guess everyone is going to take what I said out of context here, too. Wow. Okay. This is why I don't like revealing I'm trans on Reddit. The transphobia is too much. I get it, I'm the asshole for being trans, right? Be better.

Since she’s a stay at home mom, her husband works full time to support the family which means he’ll only get weekends off to actually spend time with them. I have no problem with that because it’s really none of my business as long as they’re both okay with it. 

My wife gave birth to our first baby girl last month, i love both of my girls equally. During the holidays, my wife and i went to my parents house for a christmas dinner. My family was excited to have our newborn over, my sister especially. She spent the whole time giving my wife “tips” on how to raise a newborn. I just let her be because my wife didn’t seem to mind it.

After almost two months of my wife recovering, we decided on who would stay home for our baby. We both agreed on her working for various reasons. She makes way more money and would be able to provide for us and even have extra money to put into savings. We decided on me staying home, i don’t mind it. I love spending time with my daughter, even though it can be tough at times. My wife’s job lets her get paid sick days and enough time off for her to be a part of raising our child. 

We are both very content with our plan, we’ve told family and friends about it. Even though some were doubtful, they learned to accept it. My sister, however has been extremely rude about it all. She’s been messaging my wife even more “tips” on how to raise our child. It’s gotten to the point where she has to put my sister on mute. I tried telling my sister to calm down with her annoying behavior, but she went on a rant on how mothers are supposed to be raising their children. She also said i’m forcing my wife to work which i’m really not. The thing that bothered me is when she said that i couldn’t be able to raise my child because i’m a man and my daughter is a girl. So i replied with the same thing she told me. “You can’t raise your son, he’s boy and you’re a woman” She stopped arguing after that and hasn’t reached out to apologize. I don’t feel like talking to anyone close to me about this, but i do wanna know if i’m in the wrong or not. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my family's dog a bitch because that is what she is?,"I sometimes call my family's dog a bitch because she is technically a bitch because she is a female dog, as it is what the noun ""bitch"" means.

AITA for complimenting my friend’s new boobs when my girlfriend was next to me?,"My good friend Jassie (22f), Jassie’s brother (20m), my girlfriend (22f), and I (21m) had lunch today together. Jassie and I have been close friends since we were kids but all four of us hang out together fairly regularly now. Jassie had a boob job two months ago. When I saw her flaunting her new cleavage for the first time in a spaghetti strap tank top today, I told her that “they” look awesome. She thanked me. My small-chested girlfriend was eyeing me and giving me angry mixed with a little insecure vibes the whole time at lunch and while we were bowling after. She stared at Jassie’s boobs more than I did. 


During our drive back, my girlfriend brought up the whole boob incident. She asked why I felt the need to compliment Jassie’s boobs. I told her I was just trying to be assure her that she didn’t make a mistake. That’s what friends do. She said that it’s unusual though to compliment sexualized body parts between male and female friends. She asked if I liked girls with big boobs more. I told her I like boobs with great shape, size isn’t important, and she had awesome boobs because they have great shape and symmetry. She seemed cool with that answer. I’ve always preferred bigger boobs as long as the shape is great, but I’ve never told her or shown it obviously. It’s not even a big deal at all.",Asshole
AITA for upsetting my gf or what?,"She  won't go to events with me where I drink more than a few aka get drunk bc of some incidents we had in the past. 1 incident was that I had said ""you haven't even graduated yet, how much $ do you make a year?"" when she made a joke about being a billionaire. I apologized for it. 

The second incident was at a Halloween party and I was drunk and said some things maybe I shouldn't have. I was in the car and she was saying how she didn't know the people at are job are not allowed to hang out with our superiors and I was like ""you don't know shit about our job"" and then she got mad at me and almost broke up with me.

I apologized for that too and I felt bad about it and said sorry, but she still doesn't want to go to any events where I am drunk or under the influence at all, due to what I did in the past.

AITA for kicking my roommate’s brother out of the apartment for showering with my roommate?,"My roommate Lara (20F) has a brother, Leon (18M). Her and I (20F) are juniors and he’s a freshman living in a dorm across campus. He crashes on our couch about every other weekend. I’ve been fine with that since he’s a respectful and fun person to have around. 


Yesterday morning, my own brother (23M) and I planned to have brunch and be out all day. I told Lara and Leon about that and headed off. After brunch, I came back to our room to get my lip balm that I forgot. I saw the bathroom door closed and I heard both Lara and Leon chatting indistinctly with the shower running. 


My first thought was they were showering together, which is very inappropriate in my book. It’s also very disrespectful of them to do such a taboo thing where I have to frequent everyday naked. I understand why they would not ask for my permission and this is the only place where they might get away, but who knows how many times they have already showered together when I’m not home? With these thoughts, I texted my brother to wait a bit in the car. 


I waited a minute to make sure it’s not one showering and one doing something else like brushing their teeth, blow drying their hair, putting on makeup, or using the toilet. It’s a small bathroom already. I hear no sound of any of those things so I banged on the bathroom door very hard telling them I know what they’re doing in there. I heard Leon say “oh shit”. They turned off the shower and Lara said Leon is showering with the opaque curtains there and she’s putting on makeup, so it’s nothing dirty. I’m pretty sure that wasn’t the case, but I didn’t want to keep my brother waiting.


When I got back to our apartment last night, I sat down next to Lara and Leon to have a serious conversation. I told them I’m 90% sure they were showering together since if she was doing makeup at the sink 2 feet from the door, her voice would be pretty clear, but since both of their voices were indistinct, it points to both of them being in the shower and that’s a big issue to me. They plead their case of doing separate things but I said even so, that’s still pretty inappropriate for a sister and her brother. I told Leon to get out of the apartment now, never use the shower and never stay overnight again. Lara yelled at me, saying she would never shower with Leon and I’m being a huge asshole. I told them I’m uncomfortable with him in our apartment and they should be grateful I would still let him in during the day. He called me a bitch and left. Lara continued our argument.


Today I heard Lara and my housemate from the other room gossiping about the situation. I joined in and my housemate said I shouldn’t kick Leon out even on the off chance they were actually showering together. She said every sibling relationship is different. Lara kept butting in telling us they weren’t even showering together. I saw we were at an impasse so I left to ask here.",Asshole
AITA for not inviting a section of my family to Christmas dinner?,"It's our turn to host Christmas dinner this year, but we haven't invited my husband's sister and her family because of disagreements. 

A few months ago, Natalie (sister) invited everyone except my daughter Evie to her daughter Lucy's 10th birthday party. Her reason? Apparently Evie ''bullies'' Lucy. Nat has been saying this for years but I've yet to see any physical evidence of it. 

Evie is 13. She isn't a bad kid at all, but I don't think anyone can name a 13 yo who is nice all the time. She's a very pretty girl, has lots of friends and is top of her class, and has never been in any serious trouble at school, so I strongly doubt she's a bully. In all honesty, everything is called bullying nowadays. Evie is called a bully because she might have made a few mean jokes about Lucy over many years. It's never been any more serious than that and I would deal with it immediately if it was. Maybe Nat should teach
her daughter that she won't get anywhere in the world by crying when things don't go her way. She'll be a teenager soon too, and it's a tough world.

Evie wasn't bothered about not being invited to a 10 year olds party, but I thought it was offensive to exclude every single child *except her*. That in itself is humiliating, especially as I don't doubt Nat will have happily told everyone why Evie wasn't invited. 

In response, I decided not to invite them to Christmas dinner. My husband was absolutely fuming when I told him this, but when I said my reasons - that people who went out of their way to exclude/humiliate our child aren't welcome in our home - he now agrees, but his mother and brother have been calling us non-stop, saying it would be cruel to exclude them from the family Christmas traditions. It may be cruel but it's a matter of principle and putting our child first.",Asshole
AITA for not allowing our son to visit his grandmothers house because she smokes indoors?

AITA for making my mom cook on my birthday?,"Here it is. I (32M) and my girlfriend (24F) recently went on vacation. My mom has a house in (beachy location) that she said we could use. She usually stays there October-March, but she was supposed to be out of town, which was totally fine with me. My mom can be kind of needy, and I wanted the vacation to be just about me and my girlfriend. Unfortunately, her plans fell through, so she ended up being there the whole time. 

I was already a little annoyed, but then came my birthday. We were supposed to have steaks and asparagus for my dinner, and my gf won’t touch meat, she’s vegan. I told my mom that I shouldn’t have to cook on my birthday, and I requested that she make dinner for us. She had wanted to go visit a friend that afternoon, but she didn’t end up having time because she was prepping the food. 

She never said anything to me, but apparently she told my gf that she was disappointed not to see her friend. In my view, it was my birthday, and she should have wanted to help me make it special. My gf is neutral on the situation.

AITA for squat pooping in my sister’s apartment?,"I am staying with my sister at her studio apartment this week while I’m in her city for a work trip. My workplace makes me share a room with my colleague whenever we travel, so I’d rather just stay with my sister and catch up with her this week. I got off work early today so I went back to her apartment to take a shower. Yesterday she let me know when she got off work, so I did not expect her to be back anytime soon. I didn’t close the bathroom door fully to not fog up the mirror. After taking a shower, I decided to take a dump. Seeing as she hasn’t texted me yet, I see no reason to close the door and worsen the ventilation. I began watching Youtube videos on my phone when I heard her say “what the fuck are you doing?” I haven’t pooped out yet, so I got up, got dressed, and began to explain to her the benefits of squat pooping. She says that’s gross as I’m wearing the guest slippers while squatting on the toilet rim and use those same slippers to walk around her apartment. For those who squat poop, you must know how much it hurts to do it barefoot. I guess I could see her point. She told me to start pooping like a normal person in her house. She said she’s also afraid of the toilet breaking as I’m a fairly big dude. But even so, none of the toilets I’ve ever squat pooped on, and that’s every poop since 8th grade, has ever broken before. I said I’ll follow her rules and we left it at that. But I just want to ask you guys if I was in the wrong for not asking her if could squat poop in her house in the first place. Thanks.",Asshole
AITA for telling a Hispanic Girl she’s white?,"So I go a majority Spanish school.  There only 4% of Black people there (I’m one of those 4%) So me and my friend and this girl was talking. So the  girl all like “I really don’t want to go to a school full of white people” and I said “but your white?” I knew she was Hispanic btw. She told me “no I’m not I’m actually Cuban” and I told her “Cuban isn’t a race” she then told me A BLACK PERSON “how would you feel if someone called you spic” 😳. I looked at her and said “A girls make fun of my natural hair daily,I am constantly labeled as “angry and loud” at this school because of how dark I am,and on top of all that I’m constantly being called the n-word and I here it a lot too” she was speechless after and I walked away. But I kinda feel bad for calling her white. I want to go apologize because she seemed cool and I ruined everything. Was I the Asshole?

Edit: So I spoke to the girl and she apologized for being angry at me and I apologized if I made her feel uncomfortable. We spoke at lunch and we were laughing at all the stupid and dumb slurs we get called. Thank some of you guys for actually being nice to me and helping get her perspective of the situation. These comments were kinda harsh but I dealt with the criticism better than I actually thought. After all I am only 14 so it’s kinda hard not to be sensitive and passive aggressive in these comments but I actual took everyone’s opinion in account even I did agree or disagree with them.

AITA for saying the N word at a concert full of black people? ( i am asian),"I went to a concert a couple of weeks ago to see one of my favorite rappers perform. Like many rappers, his work contains a lot of profanity and of course, the n word. I've been a fan of this artist for nearly a decade and I know the lyrics to most of his songs..

Anyway, I get to the concert and everybody around me is African American. Doesn't bother or surprise me at all -- I was already aware of the demographics of the fanbase. The concert starts, everyones chanting and having a good time, and so am I.

My favorite song comes up and I was shouting the lyrics loud and proud, through all the profanity and N words. The black people around me are staring at me pretty hard at this point. I didn't think it was a problem because I was just appreciating the lyrics, reciprocating them back to its creator. 

My intentions were not to harm anyone, and yes I know the historical significance of the term. I told my friends about this and they all say I'm in the wrong, and some of them think I'm racist. Their reasoning is that only black people are allowed to say it because they were called that during slavery. But I am asian and my people were not responsible for slavery in the US.

AITA for complimenting my ex bf’s dick size in front of our friends?,"My ex bf has really low confidence and he’s kind of nerdy/ dorky. However he was absolutely amazing in bed and his size was just... yeah. Phenomenal. We broke up a couple months ago as mutual friends and we have no hard feelings or anything. He’s a really funny, chill guy but he’s really mad at me over this. 

We were hanging out at a mutual friends place and all of us were smoking weed / getting a lil drunk. I know one of my friends is really into him and as a group we were all talking about sex because my friend bought up the topic that she’d finally lost her virginity and she was proud of it. Some of my friends have slept with other friends so there was a lot of good natured convo, nothing too much or too explicit. I joined in and said ‘guys, now that Jamie is free y’all should jump on to him because GODDAMN his dick is huge’ 

Immediately there was a lot of cat calling, lots of cheering from the guys, etc. Someone grabbed him and shook him and said ‘Jamie didn’t know you had it in ya’ He looked really embarrassed when I said that and he went red and didn’t look happy. He came up to me afterwards in private and there was no need to say that and ‘how would I like it if I spoke about your genitals in front of everybody’ I was like dude... wtf. It’s totally different for a guy and I was just trying to help. He said I shouldn’t have made any comments like that and he just looked even more awkward and flustered. 

I’m like... how the hell was I meant to know he was gonna be weird and sensitive over it? I tried to text him and asked him to calm down so we could talk because he kept sending one word answers but that riled him up even more and now he isn’t speaking to me.",Asshole

AITA for preferring the handicap stall at work?,"At my last job there was 1 set of restrooms on each floor which serviced about 300 people. In the men's room there was 3 stalls, 2 regular and 1 handicapped.

I always preferred the handicapped stall for the extra space and since it was the last one.

At some point we got a handicapped team member and soon after there was an email sent to the floor politely saying to not use the handicap stall if there were others open. It sparked a debate at work. 

My position - screw that. The best case scenario was having an empty bathroom with my stall of choice and now you're saying that option is off the table? The bathrooms were busy, especially in the morning. There were times all the stalls were full and I would have to come back. My thinking is that just because you require handicapped doesn't mean you won't ever have to wait for it.

Because it might be relevant. I almost never saw this person. They may have worked a different shift or had a work from home option. I don't believe I was involved with the incident that prompted the communication. I don't believe I ever bumped into them in the restroom.

Anyway, at the end, I did pretty well. First place tie with another guy. The tiebreaker was a question for the 2 of us. They played a voice sample of a character and we had to guess who it was. I knew the voice right away. So I buzzed in.

I said Mr. Anderson. That's who it was, but they said o was wrong. Then my opponent buzzed in and said Hank Hill. He was right and got the money, I got a stupid gift card to some restaurant I don't ever eat at. I tried explaining to the mc but he said he had to go by what was on the card. (If you don't know, Mr. Anderson is from beavis and butthead, Hank hill is from king of the hill, they're both voiced by the same guy and he uses the same voice for both characters).

AITA I told my ex I'd bring the kids back and didn't.,"ThrowAway/Mobile his gf is on here. Fake names.

Tim (M40) and I (F29) don't have the best relationship but try to make it work without involving the courts, we broke up 2wks after our 2nd was born and he met Ann (F30) 2mths later before he went to rehab. They became best friends amd then They started dating 5mths after he got out. He has been clean 5yrs. We had an agreement, Tim could have each of our kids live with him an Ann for one year each. This agreement came about because the eldest was displaying serious behaviour issues and where I lived (PG), 3hrs drive from Tim, there was no help for her. Last yr he had our eldest (Lyn7). I believed Lyn had celiac disease, Ann disagreed and got her a blood test, this was trumatic for Lyn. Ann said if Lyn did have it then she would need to adhere to gluten free foods and see a dietitian. The tests came back negative for CD. I believe Ann did it because she doesn't like me. I told her Lyn is allergic to cows milk, and gets seriously bad rashes, so she one-upped me and only gave her soy milk and no sugar ice blocks, or soy ice cream. Ann then told me that the reason Lyn was having having (the reason I believed she was CD) was because of white bread and its common in kids. She also said the Dr believed Lyns behaviour was due to sugar. I think thats bull.

This year I was moving up to where Tim lives (GE)I thought it was important for the kids to have a strong support network. I moved in with a friend while my youngest (Bea6) moved in with Tim and Ann. Tim put Lyn under my name so I could start getting money for her and look for a house of my own. As I was moving I started dating a guy from PG. I thought I should keep my old place in PG if I couldn't find a house in GE. 

The girls were happy being together, Ann put them in swimming lessons (I wasn't happy), she would read to them everynight, help them shower, pack lunches, Tim would help wash their clothes, make breakfast, and they would help Bea n Lyn with Homework. Ann help Bea settle into her new school. Ann's family, parents and siblings, love the girls, they call her parents Nana and Poppa and get treated with no difference to Ann's nieces and nephews. Anyway, I could see them whenever I wanted. But after 5 weeks I wanted to be with my BF, he couldnt move down to me, he had his kids in PG.

I got my BF to help me move back into my old house, get Lyns birth cert and secretly enrol my kids in their old school. I asked for my kids for the weekend and said I'd bring them back. But I didn't. Tim has gone to the lawyers and Ann won't answer any calls from me. Tim said Ann is broken hearted and cries, but they are my kids. It was never her place to pretend to be a mother. I told Tim that he can see them for a week in the School Holidays. I think the kids needed to be with me as I am their mum and can take care of them better. But someone on FB said what I did was cruel to the kids and I was an asshole for 'destabalising' them. I don't see how. Tim and Ann just want the kids for the money and thats all.",Asshole

WIBTA for asking my neighbor violinist to stop practicing at home for my dog?,"About six months ago I picked up a stray dog in the streets close to my current apartment. She tugged at my heartstrings and I took her in. The problem? The apartment doesn't allow pets, so I've had to keep her a secret. But she's been really well behaved and doesn't do anything to give away her presence to the landlord. It helps that they've not once checked my apartment since I've had her. She's now become my best friend.

About 3 weeks ago a young woman moved in next door. I introduced myself and gave her some home baked cookies, she invited me in and we had a bit of tea and she revealed that she was a violinist for an amateur orchestra and string quartet in the city. Cool!

She practices for about several hours every day usually in the evening. The first time she played my dog immediately started barking, and I tried to calm her down but I ended up having to make up an excuse and ask the neighbor to stop practicing (she did, to her credit). The next day I immediately went out and bought a muzzle before coming home. I didn't want anyone to know there was a dog in my home. The muzzle has kept her barking in check but it hurts me knowing my dog has to wear it for hours every evening. I get home at 6PM after work so half the time I have after work is spent with my dog muzzled.

I did some research and one of our local universities has music practice rooms, some of which can be rented out to non-students. I went next door to the neighbor and offered to rent out a room for her permanently and to ask her to practice there instead of at home. It's only 10-15 minutes away from where we live, but she politely declined saying she'd rather practice in the comfort of her home.

AITA for not providing tampons for my daughter?,"I use pads myself and ever since my daughter started menstruating, she also used pads.

My daughter is 16. She has a job and a car (with learner's permit); the nearest pharmacy is on our block, only a 5min walk or so. She has the money to buy it herself, and I told her as much. I don't mind sharing my pads with her because whatever, they're there, but if she wants something more special, it's on her and with her money.

This caused a ruckus and I don't know why. I get the most basic of basic pads, I don't need anything special, but she wants the more expensive alternative. Then that's on her, right? She told me it's ""not her fault she's a woman"" which boggles my brain because why is the onus on me to provide this for her? She's welcome to use my pads but I'm not spending needless money on a preference.

WIBTA for telling my son to stop feeding his friend?,"My 12yo son became friends with a new kid at school (Calvin). Calvin seems quiet and odd. Lately, my son has been going through snacks and food like crazy. Mind you, my son is barely 5 feet and probably isn't even 100lbs. Food is crazy expensive. I found out that my son has been ""doubling"" on lunches and snacks because he's sharing with his new friend. I asked him why he was doing that and apparently Calvin is a picky eater and my son doesn't want to see anyone go without eating and Calvin is embarrassed over what he gets for lunch. I also think Calvin's mom has financial issues. I applaud my son for having a heart, but he eats a lot as it is (he's growing and plays a lot of sports but he's still skinny). I can't afford to feed additional kids.

EDIT: No, I am not going to tell the school anything. I am not a social worker or a busybody. I have my own problems. It would be easier to just feed him than to start bringing all these people in. This kid is not the only kid at school who is poor.

AITA for not wanting a grown man in the women's bathroom?,"Since everyone seems to think that the other girl is NTA, I have a related experience and I'm wondering if the same verdict can be rendered. I am also an underage girl. My university has normal bathrooms (male, female, and in places private/disabled bathrooms). However, my university also has an official policy of letting transgendered persons (people who claim to be a gender that doesn't match their assigned, biological sex) use whatever bathrooms they want. Result: sometimes biological men use the women's bathrooms, including the bathrooms with showers. These are stall showers with curtains, but it still makes my friends and me incredibly uncomfortable and sometimes even fearful to think about.

Well, I didn't experience this first-hand until a few weeks ago. I finished up in one of the dorm showers, and went to grab my towel, and had to do a double-take, as it looked like there was a naked man in the women's room (he had a towel on). I tried to hide myself, screamed and yelled at him to leave. He put his hands out like he was trying to calm me down, but I was scared and kept shouting, and some other women ran in, and he ran out.

I went to campus security and they were very helpful and concerned that there was a predator in our dorm (the dorms are supposed to be locked but sometimes the doors are left open). They said they would check the exterior cameras and increase security until the issue was resolved.

It turns out that the man was a transgender woman. Actually, I think I'm not supposed to refer to him as a man, which is totally fine, idk what he or she wants to be called. But I was also told that I had to be okay with him using the bathroom, and that if I wasn't, I would have to shower in another building! I went to my counselor about this and was thinking of taking it up with someone higher up, but my counselor said that I was expressing bigoted views, and that who was I to tell someone which bathroom to use?

"AITA for doing a citizens arrest, even though I was wrong in the end?","I (M, 33) was in a pharmacy store and I was in the shampoo aisle. I noticed a man earlier (70’s) who had a large bag and he was loitering around the store not seeming to look at anything particular. He also kept eyeballing the store nervously. 

He came into the aisle I was in and got very close to the travel size shampoo. I thought I saw him slowly place the shampoos in his bag. I was getting really nervous and then he saw me looking at him and pretended to check his watch. 

I was 99% sure that he was shoplifting so I did a citizens arrest. I told him “I’m going to have to detain you for shoplifting” he looked shocked and he asked me if I was undercover security. I said no but that I saw what he did. He said he didn’t do anything and I again told him in a stronger voice “sir, you are going to have to put your hands behind your back so that I can to get a manager”. The man got scared and complied. 

In the end, a risk management employee came out and had to search the mans bag. They did not find anything. They also checked the cameras and later told me he did look suspicious but that without actually finding anything in his bag they couldn’t do anything and he was free to go.

AITA for essentially destroying my friend group (of other 7 years) of them misgendering me?,"So a little bit of backstory. I came out at Transgender (MTF) to my main group of mainly guy friends about a year ago. Ever since then I've had an underlying feeling that they didnt take me seriously because of my changed gender identity.

About 2 weeks ago, my suspensions were confirmed when my friend called me ""he"" when talking to his mom. Just for context, gender dysphoria was becoming more and more difficult to handle after I got my first ever dress and went to a party feeling like me, so doing things like shopping for work clothes or being called by deadname by family members was mentally crushing. So for a friend to misgender me after knowing i was a girl for about a year.. it was too much for me but I managed to keep my cool and calmly told him to call me by the correct pronouns, no big deal right? Well he completely refused saying that ""I could never take you seriously calling you a girl""

From then on, I denounced my friendship to him, and to everyone who at least mildly agreed with him. I ranted at him in discord private messages about how much that hurt me but he remained arrogrent and close minded about the whole thing not understanding why it mattered so much to me dispite me literally telling him why. I try not to talk to him all that much and since then the friend group is in shambles.

I feel like leaving was a good thing but I still feel bad for yelling at him. I feel like I didnt give him a fair chance and that the whole group was torn apart cause I was butthurt. Did I do the right thing standing up for my self or did I go overboard?

TLDR: My friend misgendered me and I yelled and insulted him about it, destroying our friendship and shambling our friend group.

AITA for getting jeans banned for women by asking about the dress code?,"I (26M) recently started a new job. The dress code is pretty straightforward: clean closed toed shoes, something nicer than a t-shirt, and something nicer than jeans. 

After working a few days, I noticed several of my female coworkers wearing jeans, which is explicitly against the dress code. Now I didn't in any way want to stop them from wearing jeans, but if they could do it, I wanted to do it too, as jeans are more comfortable than slacks imo. 

So I went to the boss and asked what the actual policy on jeans is. He said the policy is no jeans. When I asked about the women wearing jeans, he said they were allowed because they ""aren't sagging or baggy and are a dark color"", which was accurate. However, because I can't just let things go, I pointed out that I own jeans that also meet those requirements, so could I wear them too? He eventually said something along the lines of ""no, men can't wear jeans here"". And because I still can't just let things go, I pointed out that that's technically gender discrimination. 

A day later, boss announced that the no jeans policy now applies to everyone, and now several of my female coworkers are angry with me. Like I said earlier, I wasn't trying to get their jeans banned, I just wanted to be allowed to wear mine. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for ensuring that my family won't get another dog?,"So, I've always hated dogs (let the booing begin!). My parents knew that when they got a dog five years ago. They did it completely behind my back- I just came home one day to a dog! In my house! Somehow, they believed that I would realize that dogs just aren't that bad and become bffs with an animal that eats its own shit; this, of course, never came to pass. If anything, I hated it more the more time I spent with it. 

Anyways, the thing finally left my life when it got hit by a car a couple of months ago. I've been really enjoying this peaceful, dog-free house. I forgot how nice it was, how quiet and clean and just wonderful. But unfortunately, my mother doesn't share this perspective. She wanted another dog, despite my well-known antipathy towards them. She gave me a twenty to keep mum when this new dog's owner came by to see if it's a good environment, but I just physically could not keep quiet. 

I told the dog owner that I really desperately hated dogs, and I'll admit went on a little rant. I let all my pent-up anti-dog emotions just pour out. By the end I was in tears and the new dogs owners did not let us have him. 

My mother is completely irate. I offered to give the money back and she just started crying. AITA?",Asshole
"AITA for having sex in the room I share with my sister whilst she was asleep, and calling her a prude?","My identical twin sister and I are both 21 and go to separate colleges as we were sick of being compared to each other. When the pandemic started, we both came home. When we lived at home, we had our own separate bedrooms, but now my dad is using my bedroom, I’ve been sleeping in my sisters room, in a different bed of course. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 3 years and he’s truly a part of my family. He lives alone so my parents have been okay with him coming over as long as he doesn’t go anywhere else. He hasn’t come over that much, only a couple times. 

He came over yesterday at around 6pm, we ate dinner with my family and then went upstairs. My sister got a temporary job in a supermarket when she came home so had been at work all day and had fallen asleep. Obviously due to not seeing each other much recently, my boyfriend and I haven’t been able to have sex so we thought we’d take the opportunity whilst my sister was asleep. 

After my boyfriend had left my sister came and told me that she was awake the entire time and felt too awkward to say anything, but that we shouldn’t have been having sex in our parents house at all, let alone with her in the room. I called her a prude and laughed. She got pissed and went and told my parents, who’ve now said that they won’t be letting my boyfriend over anymore as they have a strict no sex policy whilst we’re home. I got pissed at my sister and asked her why she’d been so jealous of me our entire lives, which opened up a massive argument about how we’ve always been pitted against one another.

AITA for telling my sister to adopt a baby when I had my own biological kids?,"My sister is infertile (both of us are in our late 20s.)  I'm not.  I had three biological kids, she doesn't have any but is undergoing IVF for her first.  She isn't asking our family to pay for it, she lives in a state where she has some insurance coverage so money isn't the issue here, it's more just ethics.

I told her that before she goes through with this she really needs to seriously consider adoption.  She blew up at me.  She said that almost every infertile person has considered adoption, and they don't need to be reminded.  She says she already looked into it, and although she doesn't care about passing on her specific genes, she wants more control over the child's health and custody, and doesn't want to deal with drug exposure in utero or biological relatives coming back into the picture.   (Edit: forgot to add she said that the only children legally free for adoption already that don't cost $50K are older or disabled and often traumatized.  I don't believe it.)

I feel like this is just not true.  There at tons of healthy baby orphans out there nobody wants...like millions...and I've never heard of any bio family coming back in to claim them.  It's also expensive but even with her insurance coverage I'm sure IVF is more expensive.  And there are literally orphans suffering all over the world while she NEEDS to create a new one?  I was just very upset to hear that she could be so selfish.

She told me I, of all people, have no place to judge because none of my children are adopted, they are all biological.  But I didn't need fertility treatments to have them.  I didn't need to adopt, but yes, I do think she needs to look into it.

She says she won't talk with me about this again until I adopt- and she specified that adopting an older child or disabled child are really the only ""free"" options that are unlikely to result in years of bio parental intervention and court cases, so if I adopt I better be open to that.  Now if I could adopt I would adopt as many children of as many ages/disability as I could, I would want to love them all and give them all a great home...but I already have three bio kids and can't support anyone else.

Maybe I shouldn't have said anything but I don't think she was right to get angry.  Is it worth it to educate her further on adoption?  She clearly doesn't know what she's talking about and I'm very concerned for the orphans she's neglecting.",Asshole
AITA for having a meltdown at my abortion appointment?,"I'm a little afraid of pro life people coming after me, so throwaway account..

I had an appointment to receive the abortion pill today. I'm estimated 9 weeks and my nausea has been horrific for at least two weeks now. For reference, I have a mid to low threshold of pain, so I might just be a baby. I've been throwing up every hour/every other hour, or on a good day I only gag and dry heave after I eat/if I get hungry. The nausea also gives me intense dizziness when I stand, and so I have been stranded in bed for the past two weeks.

Fast forward to today, I am so relieved that I will be able to stop the nausea enough to sit up at least and hopefully keep stuff down. Unfortunately, due to my nausea being this bad, the clinicians could not, in good faith, allow me to take the pill.

I... I bawled. I didn't scream cry, but there were a lot of tears at the thought of having to wait another week of nausea for surgical. (I feel like I should also mention that I actually did initially make an appointment for surgical, I didn't make the appointment because: I cannot eat 8 hours prior, the clinic that offered surgical was 40 by car from my place and I don't have a car, so I would need to take public transport. The appointment was at 6 am, and I have insomnia that's been heightened by pregnancy, so I can't sleep until 6-8 am. I'm also honestly scared of surgical) All of this, I made sure to communicate with my clinician.

I understand that the clinicians did what they were trained to do, and they gave me the best way to terminate the pregnancy, but my main clinician that day told me that I should seek therapy because this level of anxiety isn't healthy. She told me that I should not be reacting this way about everything. She also told me that my crying was ""acting out"" and she asked me if she needed to call 911 on multiple occasions. Her tone was imo a little patronizing (she was still nice) and I overheard her telling another nurse to patch me to someone who can help me reschedule because she just couldn't deal with me.

I felt justified at the moment crying because I was afraid and frustrated, but now I look back at it, maybe I did overreact by crying that much.... Am I the asshole..? Did I just throw a tantrum... Do I apologize to her?",Not the A-hole
AITA for dieting for half a year without informing my twin sister?,"My twin sister and I have always naturally hovered around the same height and weight like 5 feet 6 inches and 125 pounds. We have always been very close and keep no secrets from each other. I went to study abroad in China for almost half a year. My stomach couldn’t handle the local food too well so I thought it was a good time to diet and lose a few unnecessary pounds. I send my sister photos occasionally but I guess you can’t tell weight too well in photos, especially recently when I’m skinny since I’m always covered up for the weather. I’m down to around 110 pounds right now and feel amazing, though I might need to get a boob job soon lol. Whenever my family asks if I eat well, I always say I am to not worry them. 


I arrived home last Saturday and everyone commented how skinny I became. My mom said I look better but a bit too skinny now and need to add a few pounds. Subsequently, she told my sister to meet me in the middle. My sister said she felt hurt that I didn’t tell her I lost so much weight because she would have dieted too if she had known. Now she keeps saying she’s too fat. I tell her she doesn’t need to be the same weight as me and she’s not fat at all. If she’s fat, that means I was fat before too. I don’t know if I’m looking too much into it, but she’s been looking at me with some jealous eyes and is treating me less friendly than before.

AITA for rating girls with my friends?,"AWTS for rating girls?

I hope this is not that controversial

Me and my friends got a ""rating system"" for girls where we rate from 1 to 3 ""signatures"", that way we can kind of say it out loud without people knowing what we're talking about (We are males, of course).

The problem is, we got a female friend in our group that is a pretty intense feminist. It's not annoying and she is very smart, we don't have a problem with that and we like to listen to her opinion and she even teaches us sometimes about ""feminine things"" that men can't get. It's a pretty strong friendship.

However, she hates when we use the rating system in front of her, once saying to us that she hated that we did that. Since I knew that she didn't like it I don't do it in front of her, but two of my friends still do it just to annoy her.

I get why she doesn't like it, but me and my friends argue that we are not the kind of men that disrespect girls, verbally or physically,  we would never do that, and we are pretty supportive when it comes to girls defense, specially here in Mexico, where we are tired of hearing about girl abuse. When one of us likes a girl or when we get along with one, we treat her right and respectful, we get a lot of fun with a lot of friends, in our close friends group or out. We even have told some selected girls about the system and they are cool with it, maybe because they know how we are.

We just like girls, at the end of the day, and it's a way of talking or saying how each one of us likes a girl particularly. But I would be lying if I said that this doesn't bother me, not because our friend gets away from us, our friendship is too awesome for that to happen, but it bothers me because she is pretty smart and conscious, and maybe, just maybe, we are doing something wrong.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I get that is wrong doing it in front of our friend, that's why I don't do it in front of her, I am more worried about it being right or wrong.
We're in college.
We rate males as well, only (obviously) not that often. Our friend did it a few times as well, but obviously is not the same because the context for men isn't the same for a women, at least in these times, that's why I didn't bring it up.",Asshole

AITA for telling my sister's boyfriend the truth about her,"My sister has been dating this guy for over a year. they're really serious, talking marriage, etc. I made a comment to my parents that it was good of him to be with her, knowing her history, which is that her old boyfriend abused her and was basically her pimp for a few months before she came back to live with my parents. I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.

I thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment.

AITA for arguing with my vegan sister about eggplant parmesan?,"I (28M) work as a chef, and admittedly I didn't/don't have a lot of experience with vegetarian and vegan cooking because my training didn't teach much of that and my restaurant doesn't have vegan options. However one thing that WAS involved in my training was eggplant parmesan, which my sister (21) decided to make for her and my mom for Valentine's weekend.

I was curious as to how she was doing an eggplant parmesan if she can't eat dairy so I questioned her about it. She said she was using a blend of vegan mozzarella and parmesan style cheeses and wasn't breading the eggplant because they actually don't traditionally bread the eggplant in Italy. I kind laughed because - 'hey I don't think that's true about the breading, but even if so, the Italians use real cheese, not vegan cheese. It's not really eggplant parmesan you're making.' She just said 'Well sorry for being vegan and lactose intolerant. You're not eating it or making it so I actually don't care for your opinion.""

I thought that was a bit harsh and I reminded her I am a chef so it's not like I don't know what I'm doing. She said she's not eaten dairy in 3 years and meat in 2 so she knows better than me about vegan cooking. I told her I'm sure I could easily make a vegan meal, and she asked why I never have then, even though she knows I cook so much at work I don't like to cook at home often.

She then turned to me and said just because I'm a chef doesn't mean I'm the only one in the family who knows how to cook. She said just because she's 3/4 through an accounting degree doesn't mean she's going to argue with our dad about how he should do his taxes. 

Then at dinner, my dad and I had something different from my mom and sister so we could have meat, and my sister wouldn't even let me try any of the eggplant 'parmesan' though she offered some to dad. She said she was only gonna let people try it who 'didn't annoy her.' AITA here? Nothing I said was untrue, and I was just joking around a bit honestly.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting my daughter anymore?,"Trust me, it’s much more complicated then it seems. I have three kids (fake names) Suzy (18f) Brian (16m) and June (14f).

Suzy and Brian look just like me and my husband. Tall, thick curly Brown hair, Brown eyes, and tan skin. I get along with Suzy and Brian very well. I love them very much. 

June, looks nothing like me or my husband. Blonde, short, blue eyes and pale skin. Now I never questioned that she was ours until recently. I carried her and I never cheated so there was no other explanation.

I never had a good relationship with June. We are civil, but I’ve never really had a connection with her. My husband loves her very much. They sing together, work on guitars together. They have the perfect father/daughter bond.

I noticed recently that she isn’t like me or my husband at all. She has really bad eyes, and really bad allergies. Neither has ever been a issue in my or my husbands family. We went to the doctor to get her blood tested for any underlying issue that may be contributing to her other problems. 

Here’s where it begins, my husband has AB blood and I have A. Suzy has A and Brian has AB. But we recently discover with the blood test, that June has o-. As some of you may know, it is impossible for a A and AB couple to have O children. We got a dna test done, and we discovered that neither of us are actually related to June.

Of course we went investigating, and discovered that our child was switched with another by a mentally ill nurse when they were born. We found the family that had our child, and I met her. Let’s call her tulip. I had a immediate connection with tulip when I met her. 

She looks just like my other two children, and I already feel so much love for her, more then I have ever felt for June. I want custody of tulip, but if I do that, we’d have to give up June. 

I am willing to make that sacrifice for my baby, but my husband isn’t. He screamed at me and said that June is just as much our baby, and that we’d be monsters to give her up and ‘steal’ tulip away from her parents. 

But the thing is, tulip IS our baby. But my husband refuses to see it that way. I just want tulip back, but my husband doesn’t. He says that he would like shared custody of both the girls with the other set of parents.

I think thats ridiculous. Why would we pay for another child that isn’t even ours by blood? My husband hates me at the moment. I think I’m right, but I’m not so sure now. AITA?

AITA for defending my choice of gifts?,"WeI'm using a throwaway because this sounds bad even to my ears somewhat. The short story of it is, I have a ton of relatives but no actual family. My actual mother died when I was young. My adoptive parents and (some) biological relatives have admitted in therapy that they don't love me and only care for me and give me things out of guilt and obligation. I have higher care expectations placed on me as an ""oldest child"" that the actually loved family members don't have. All the obligation, no affection.

I'm not angry and I don't cry over it anymore, it's just a little sad to see that all of these people are capable of warm love, just not towards me. I don't do well in relationships and I wouldn't be shocked to die alone. I make terrible choices and I am overly kind and let people walk over me.

I'm not an addict or anything. I'm a standard mid-20s office worker living in the city. I graduated college. I've never been arrested. Never caused issues in school or at home. I'm just deeply unwanted, but I get that health insurance and phone bill covered (not for too long on both) as well as Christmas and birthday gifts.

Naturally, I want higher quality things. The gift train HAS a clear end, and I don't want junk. I need stuff that lasts. So I ask for things like real pearl earrings, good quality beauty products, down comforters, gift cards, and leather shoes (not all in one year obviously). I need good quality stuff, and quite frankly I deserve it as it's not like I get any other benefits of a family. I also don't have qualms about using my status to guilt people into giving me nicer hand me downs. I once made 5 people cry to win myself a solid gold intricate necklace. It's gorgeous.

I've gotten some flak over my asks and the fact that I not only don't avoid animal products but will ask for them. I don't think I should have to care. These things are higher quality. My relatives who are complaining will be getting care for life. I'll only get gifts for a few more years at most.

AITA for giving my sons extra gifts to charity?,"I had a birthday party for my son last weekend.  He just turned 6.  I made it clear to everyone invited to just bring themselves and no gifts.  We live a very minimalistic life and I absolutely hate clutter.  My son has too much as it is and it gets to be a real pain to clean up after.  Last year I adopted a minimalist lifestyle and donated a good chunk of out belongings to Salvation Army.  I’ve been open about living this way with all the people in my life. 

Of course I got him a few things, but that’s really all the extra stuff I wanted to add to my house right now.  Most of the guests however decided to ignore my request and brought gifts anyways.    I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I was pretty offended that so many people ignored my request.  I was so torn when my son wanted to open the gifts knowing that I’d just be getting rid of them.  I let him do it though and I’m still not sure if that was the right choice. 

After everyone had left I told me son that he could keep any of the gifts, but he would have to give up something in his room for it.  He did end up giving up some of his things to make room for some gifts (even one of the gifts I had bought for him so thanks for that family and friends) and I bagged them up and on Monday took them to Salvation Army. 

I was frustrated and made a status about it on Facebook about the extra work of having to go down there and it got some negative attention from people who brought gifts to the party.  I don’t really know what I could have done differently, I was clear that people should not bring gifts, but they did anyways.   A lot of the comments feel like backseat parenting.

Have a good day” and closed the door. I didn’t think it would be that big a deal, since people use public WiFi all the time, what would it hurt to share it between neighbors?

AITA if I ask my sister to not being her autistic son to my wedding and more..,"I'll start  first with the situation and then my thoughts. I already feel like the asshole but I want  to be honest.

Let me first say, I have the utmost respect for any parent, or any one, for raising a child that hasn't developed neurologically, that is on the more severe side of a spectrum. I am ashamed to say I  would not have the strength to do what these people are capable of  doing. I am not that strong a person.If I knew I was having a child still in the womb that shows signs of autism, down syndrome, or any other major \*\* severe neurological developement\*\*,  I would abort it without a second thought. I am aware there are families out there who love their child 100% and if they could change things, they wouldn't, I feel skeptical about that. Given the reverse these parents would not change their normal child to a one with a mental disorder given the chance. So  Reddit, AITA for thinking this way?

For the \*situation\*. I am going to keep things vague.My  spouse and me are going to be having a small and close wedding. This particular wedding is steeped in ceremony and  tradition and there is going to be moments of silence/praying and reading of vows. My sister has an autistic son 14 years of age  on the DSM-5 level 3. To paint a picture, he is constantly yelling,  making sounds, grunting, and moving around. If he doesn't have a video of a cartoon playing on his Ipad he will make pleading sounds/cry and physically get his mother's or father's attention to give it to him. My sister and her husband will have to literally  take care of him for their entire lives, that includes, feeding him,  taking him to the washroom, wiping him after he goes no.2. Me and my  spouse are excited for this point in our lives, my spouse is amazing and is happily accepting of my family including my nephew. although for this occasion we both agree that having my nephew at that part of the wedding would be undesirable, nor would I feel it is right to insist my spouse having to put up with that on our day, especially when this type of wedding what she was wanting since she was a kid. I am thinking in the most sincere way possible to ask my sister not bring her autistic son to our wedding. AITA?

I  love my sister's family and I love my niece, she's such a bright kid and hopeful. she's only 6 and she's starting to realize her brother is not ""normal"". I feel sad whenever I think about how my sister, her husband, and her daughter will have to deal with that ""burden"" (and yes I  said Burden) for their entire lives.I feel my sister and her family would be better off financially, physically, and mentally if he never existed. If the son somehow were to pass away, in the long run it will be for the better for them. That last part is ONLY my opinion and how I feel/view on that. thanks everyone for reading. AITA? There's much more on how I feel but the original was way over the max 3k word count.

Edit. a few words. and a redditor pointed out mental disorder is wrong in this instance so I changed that.I also agree I am TA, no two ways about that. And me and my spouse won't be having any kids unless we adopt or either one of us gets artificially inseminated. I want to let people know when it comes to choices, kids, parents, it's not as a simple as changing one kid's hair color from red to brunette as one redditor simply puts it, that's a false equivalency in this situation. If I was a parent and had a magical choice between having a kid that has no \*\*majorly severe\*\* neurological deficiencies as apposed to one where I would have to wipe them and their mess after No.2 for their entire lives, I would choose the first choice.

And to answer a few questions, If any one of my loved ones gets into an accident where they become severely physically handicapped or in a coma, I would care for them with all my heart. It is not so much the physical capabilities we care for in people but it is in the mind that makes them who they are.  If they suffered neurologically where it severely changed their personality into violent, worse, or into a point where it resembles DSM-5 level 3,or similar I am pretty sure I would be not strong enough to deal with it.

if I were to be in that position, and this is just Speaking Personally and from me and only me, I would not want to become a burden on my spouse, or family if it came to that.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPaMrFFqx7Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPaMrFFqx7Q)This exactly close, if not similar to my nephew. These parents and ones like my sister are stronger than I'll ever hope to be.

WIBTA if I tell my new girlfriend that I have high standards?,"edit edit: Thank you so much for all the feedback. I'm definitely learning.  
edit: I did not put enough of a sanity/self-awareness filter on for this :P Read my edits/comments.

We've just started being a couple a few days ago and so far things are pretty good. We're both trying to be mature about the relationship which is a welcome change for me, we both seem physically and emotionally attracted to each other, we're both majoring in computer science.

The thing is that I'm 23 (almost 24) and she's 19 (almost 20) and I think I have some personality quirks that might make it hard for me to fully connect to her. It's honestly mostly about intelligence. I kind of pride myself on caring enough to really really understand the workings of the world and really caring about the people in it, and it's always been something that makes me feel a bit alien to other people. So far she definitely seems like a really kind person and smarter than average but not really having the same passion or knowledge as me. I have this slightly obsessive worry that I'm going to not fully connect with her and it's going to come out and she's going to feel really insecure about it. She's young and has a single mom who she helps with the bills but who I think doesn't let her have social media other than instagram so I sort of understand that she might be sheltered and that can change. Although the last chick I dated also was helping her parents with stuff and it seems to bring a lot of maturity.

My main point is that I really enjoy having deep intellectual conversations with someone who actually knows what they're talking about and we both want to be open and honest about any issues the relationship has, so I feel like I should say that. She's expressed some insecurity before and I don't want to make that worse unnecessarily.

I actually wrote a [2 page letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cz1ydb/wibta_if_i_tell_my_new_girlfriend_that_i_have/eyvlhej/) to her when I was anxious a couple nights ago and I don't think I want to give it to her anymore, but I still feel like I should say something about it. Like maybe I could say that I would feel more connected if she over time (she's busy with school and work right now, like me) put more effort into understanding how the world works. I feel like there's no easy way to put it and if I say something there's a risk that I make her more insecure.

I don't want to just break up with her or anything, we just met and started dating so I don't really know how much of an issue this is. It's also an issue for literally every person I've dated or been close friends with and I am already pretty lonely so I'd really like to try and power through it, since it's probably more of a problem of my own ego than anything.

So should I say something?

&#x200B;

edit: Okay initial responses are calling me an asshole which is probably warranted but I want you guys to know that I'm just trying to be honest about my own desires and I really care about her so I don't want to just hurt people by being myself. I don't look down on other people or value them less because of intelligence or knowledge. I wouldn't value her less but I just feel like I have an honest preference for someone who can have a good intellectual discussion. Having dating preferences isn't the same as being an egotistical asshole and I would never tell her that I think she's too dumb or anything like that, I am really really careful and she considers me a really kind person already. Maybe that's some kind of sociopathy but it's better than being vocally an asshole.",Asshole
AITA for harshly calling out my single mum for trying to take credit for my achievements?,"The basic situation was me and my mum were at a family dinner with aunts we hadn't seen in a while when she decided to start bragging about my wealth/job. Got fed up and told her to stop which clearly provoked her a bit, she then called me ungrateful and lucky for having ""such a good mum"". Truth be told she wasn't truly awful, but provided very little support and said things to me you just shouldn't say to children e.g. calling me a monster, retard etc. Rest of my brothers are working minimum wage, in jail, dead due to ""self termination"" etc and frankly I was probably the most aggressive/violent/prone to depression out of all of them but was lucky to be born very gifted academically so excelled at school despite shit happening at home hence knew I had a future outside of crime/min wage.

&#x200B;

Anyway I lost my temper and openly called her out, saying she did a shit job and the only reasons I'm a doctor/rich is because I was lucky to be born smart, if I wasn't I would most likely be dead or getting arrested constantly . She tried denying it so I pointed out a few things she did, she was crying by this point and played the "" it's hard being a single mum"" card. By this point I was stood up and shouted something along the lines of ""The fuck are you on about, it's your own fault for being a dumb whore and not having an abortion. Fuck you"" and stormed out.

&#x200B;

Got a lot of shit from my family over the phone as my mums apparently ""considering ""self termination"" "" and they never want to see me again. To be honest most of them are trash I wouldn't associate with normally so I don't really care. Can't help but wonder if I was too harsh tho, AITA?",Asshole
AITA for hiring my son’s old love interest?,"My son(37M) and his wife(38F) recently went through a second failed cycle of IVF. Doctors had determined a few years back that his wife cannot conceive without the help of IVF.

To add to his devastation, ever since the failed cycle, she’s become a virtual zombie. 

She spends her days poring over adoption options, and saying things like how their high powered careers and her background in childhood development would make them ideal matches.

The problem is that all the while my son and our side of the family have always desired a biological grandchild. 

Recently, my son has reconnected with an ex girlfriend. She is 32 and their relationship fell apart 10 years ago because she ran into trouble with the law. However, he has always said she was the one who got away.

His girlfriend recently moved back into town, and my son met up with her. He found out she has partial custody of a child, and was looking for employment. 

My son works for the family business, so I reached out to her and offered her a secretarial position that would pay well. 

For the first time in a long time, my son was happy to go to work and his performance improved drastically. 

However today I get an angry visit from his wife, asking why I hired a convicted felon who also happened to be her husband’s ex girlfriend. 

I was angry that she would question my hiring decisions  and asked her to leave my office. 

Later today, my son called and said she asked him to find some other place to live, so he ended up having to move his things into our family home. 

When I asked him he confirmed that he felt like his only option was adoption and his wife was pounding that reality into his head, and it was making him miserable. 

My son is the type of person who is afraid to go after what he wants because he’s a people pleaser. 

So AITA for giving my son the push he needs to see that there are other options out there? That his dream of being with a woman who can have his natural born kids isn’t unattainable? 

Especially since my son would cry and say that he and his ex would talk about how desperately they wanted a big family together. 

I have never commented on the fact that my daughter in law has been making my son sleep on the couch for the past week, so I am also furious that she would question decisions that I have the right to make.",Asshole
AITA for wanting my girlfriend to sit through a 30 minute whale show?,"Throwaway, mobile, formatting, etc.


I love SeaWorld, it's my favorite park and my girlfriend loves Busch Gardens, so we have had the annual passes for a while. Now, I'm deathly terrified of heights so I don't ride *anything*. I basically don't do much at the parks except wait around for my girlfriend to ride the rides at the park which takes all day because the lines sometimes are 45+ minutes long and she likes to ride them multiple times, so we get there when the park opens and leave when it closes. 


Now, I don't mind doing this. I'm glad she gets to enjoy what she likes and I like spending time with her, all I ask in return is for her to sit through the whale show at SeaWorld which is 30 minutes and you learn about whales and also get splashed by them. 


I'm not gonna lie to you Reddit, I like to sit anywhere from row 2 to row 5 in a specific section where the whale splashes the most and you get *soaked*. I find it fun but I understand it's not for everyone, especially my girlfriend. 


She *hates* water. It messes with her hair because it makes it fizzy and whatnot, so she hates getting wet. She also gets sick easily, so usually if she gets wet she will catch a cold. 


I'm sure you see the problem by now. She refuses to do the whale show with me, she says I'm an asshole for wanting to put her through something she hates and might make her sick. She wants me to go to the parks with her, wait around while she does the rides and the one thing I like doing, she wants me to do it by myself because she says that since I'm scared of rides, she's forced to ride by herself so it's fair. 



I know I sound like an asshole, which is why I'm posting here, but let me explain my side. When she rides, I don't just disappear. I enter through the exit so I can take pictures of her on the ride. I stand by the fence outside so I can take a video of her when the ride drops and she can say hi to the camera. I try to get involved as much as I can without actually riding.



I've also tried to compromise. I'm not evil, I wouldn't make her get sick on purposes. I tried to offer a compromise, I would buy her a poncho so she wouldn't get wet. There's plenty of people who do the whale show with a poncho on and they don't get wet, only the poncho does. So if she wore a poncho, she could enjoy it with me without getting wet. I also offered to bring her an extra change of clothes so that in the unlikely scenario that she gets wet through the poncho, she can change clothes in the bathroom. She rejected both of these ideas. 



I think it's unfair of her to ask me to stand around for 12 hours, two days in a row at two parks, watching her have fun and the one thing I enjoy doing, a 30 minute whale show, she can't do with me. 


Maybe I'm wrong, so I'd love to her what other people think. What do you think reddit, who's the asshole here?


Edit: Please stay on topic. I'm not here to argue about the ethics of SeaWorld. I'm here to discuss an issue with myself and my girlfriend. Thank you.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to visit my sisters new apartment cause she doesn’t have a dishwasher?,"My sister recently moved out. She wants me to come over to stay at her place. The problem with this is that the new apartment doesn’t have a dishwasher. I have over the years developed a rellay unclear phobia. I’m really scared of the germs on the different utensils and plates. I can’t feel that they are clean (even if you wash them by hand)if it isn’t in a dishwasher I trust?! I have to take hand washed bowls and all and put them into the dishwasher at home cause I still don’t feel like they are clean. Even if a bowl comes straight out of the dishwasher and has a tiny spot on it, I can’t help too feel the hole bowl is infected and have to run it thought the dishwasher again. The occasions I actually do drink and eat outside the house I have to wash them myself multiple times and then take boiling water and run it over the item. Despite that I still feel like they aren’t clean at all and have to force myself to use them.
It’s very unclear, but it’s a huge stress for me on a daily bases. 
Because she doesn’t have a dishwasher I am really stressed about staying over. She on the other hand now kinda feel like I’m just using this as an excuse to not stay over and she isn’t all too happy about it. The weird thing about this phobia is that it dosent always kick in when I’m at other places. For instance at our grandparents I don’t have a problem with it. Ofc I always have to check everything and feel a slight discomfort using the things. But I survive. 
Over the years we have also been staying over in our summer house where we have to hand wash everything and I’ve been able to use them items then. She uses this as an argument all the time and she uses the “what you don’t trust me?”. I try to explain to her that we haven’t been at the summer place for years now and places that do hand wash their things I still feel uncomfortable but I just try to repress it. Again her counter argument is “why can’t you do it when you’re at my place then?”.

I know it’s not on me that my phobia has gotten more sever the past few years, but the hole family is really starting to get mad at me at this point cause it’s ridiculous and not real?
She has lived there for a week and I’ve visited but just don’t want to stay for a longer period where a meal or any drink are involved. Said I would gladly come over if we get single use items. But again they all get pretty mad at me.

AITA for not wanting to go to her new apartment?

Edit: Thank you for all the kind comments<3 I will try to seek help, kinda want too but I get extremely shamed by my hole family and they keep telling me off every time I even mentioning it and terrified over what they are going to make me do in therapy. But mainly the negative and very down putting responds I get. Plus kinda need the help of my partners to get a hold of a clinic cause they are still my legal guardians. Paper plates and plastic cups was the solution I came with that we agreed on. But more and more she is like “but you’re waisting nature” “but you can do it at other places” “no one has touched anything”. So either way I’m getting paint up as the asshole.",Asshole

AITA Becaues I get upset when the kids come into the bedroom in the middle of the night?​,"I hate this and my wife gets angry with me that I'm not open to them coming into the room in the middle of the night. I can't help it, but it really annoys me when the kids do this. 

For example, the other night the 7 year old came into the bedroom and I sighed hard. I was annoyed. My wife told her to go back to her room, and she'd be in to lay with her for a bit. My wife never went, but the kid fell asleep on her own. 

An hour later, the 3 year old comes into the room and I sigh again only this time say, ""Oh god."" My wife does the same thing she did with the 7 year old. The next day the Mrs. has an attitude with me and tells me she's pissed about the ""Oh god"" comment with the kid coming into the room.

I hate being woken up in the middle of the night. I hate that sometimes my wife does go back to the room with them. Sometimes they sleep on the floor next to the bed when the come in, and sometimes they end up in the bed with us. 

Ultimately, my wife and I don't much time together. Sleeping with her is actually something I look forward to b/c it is just us. And yes, the possibility of sex is a beautiful thing which gets squashed when the kids come in.",Asshole

AITA for not wanting my gfs dog to live with me if she moves in ... please read,"So I’ll start off by saying I’m (Male early 30’s) not an animal person, I don’t like the smell, I’m mildly allergic they’re needy, they’re pretty expensive (at least my gfs dog) and they honestly don’t do much for me emotionally. Sorry to sound like the grinch here folks.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 8 months and I absolutely adore her, she’s great it works I’m glad about time right? Lol but the only downfall is she has a bulldog that’s about 120 pounds overweight, he slobbers everywhere, makes me sneeze like crazy, invades my personal space, wakes me up randomly barking in the middle of the night (I’m an army vet so that means I wake up in attack mode myself with a shotty in hand and scan her house, we both live alone btw) and is just overall to me a nuisance.


Recently she’s been wanting to live together because she lives far from her job and and I live really close (my job is also close everything works right!?). The only problem is I told her I don’t want the dog in my house and she was devastated. She’s never really had a relationship over 2 years and this dog has been in her life for about 5 and it’s her longest relationship although she regularly hangs out with friends who’s she’s know for since high school so I don’t understand the bond there to the animal. The thing is 120 lbs although not an aggressive breed my landlord said he doesn’t want it here point blank no exceptions .


Ok no problem so I start looking for houses and apartments etc and filter large dogs and I’m shocked .... the difference in prices, interest rates, and overall selection is outstanding. Like fucking night and day. Plus she always complains the dog is costing her so much in food and medication(she’s a bartender in off season doesn’t make much and I’m a senior software engineer in the six figure mark so I one day expect that dog to become part of my expenses because she can’t really afford him).
So looking at all these housing options I’m taking a huge risk and losing a lot of money over an animal that isn’t mine. I think I love this girl but I feel like this is a huge deal breaker for me. She doesn’t know yet and I haven’t really discussed it yet but my question is if I say “it’s either me or the dog and you have to get rid of it” does that make me the asshole? Please be fair that I’m not an animal person and downvote because of that, everyone has a preference and are entitled to their opinion, thank you in advance.


TLDR: my (male 30s) gf (late 20s) dog is huge (120lbs), I’m allergic to, is super expensive to maintain and will soon enough cost my housing situation to increase dramatically. AITA for asking her “it’s either me or the dog”?

WIBTA if I kept the vibrator I bought for my gf and I at my place?,"Throwaway, mobile, blah blah blah.

I just bought a Hitachi magic wand to use in the bedroom with my girlfriend after she expressed interest in getting one. I’m considering whether I want to tell her I want to keep it at my place or that she can take it with her. 

My reasoning/defense:

1. This is not a gift specifically for HER. I bought this as a tool for both of us to find joy from (most of my pleasure in the bedroom is about making my partner happy). 

2. If for whatever reason we don’t end up working out, I would like to keep my $150 investment to possibly use in future relationships. If I let her take it, I feel like it would then become HERS.

3. I am nervous about possibly being replaced. Why walk 30 minutes to the boyfriends house when Mr. Hitachi can do much better? 

Reasons why I would be TA:

1. This is a bit controlling. It could come off as “you may only find pleasure when you’re with me” which is not my intention. 

2. I am providing an incentive for her to come over based around sex.",Asshole
AITA for not giving my sister my car,"Hello Reddit, sorry for formating, I'm on mobile. Also, this happend back in december, I finally have enough time to post it. Let's start with the story 
The cast: my sister(F,20), my parents(65), me(M,32), my wife(F,31) and my extended family. Let's start with the basics, me and my uncle are the only people in the family that can actually drive like a sane person and can spot a difference between a chevy cobalt and a school bus. But he is not really all that involved into family life since we all live in San Diego while he moved to Sydney back in 2008. My sister, as everybody else in the family got pregnat at the age of 20. She didn't go to college beacuse she considers it uselles and a waste of time and money, she also works at McDonald's. My parents gave her their 1992 corolla when she turned 16 under the condition that they can drive it too sometimes beacuse they can't afford a new car. 
Needless to say that they didn't give me a car when I was 16. I was always the family abomination, to the adition that I am liberal and pan, I am the only one that graduated from college, and don't have any kids at 32! Imagine how selfish of me not to have kids at 32! As expected, the corolla died after 27 years, I sometimes really felt sorry for the poor car. I know pretty well that my sister's boyfriend can afford to buy a car, he is buying her some really expensive stuff and she only works beacuse my parents woud throw her out of the house if she didn't have a job. Now, I myself am a massive car guy and a car nerd. Since I spent some time at college and not breeding, doing drugs and drinking alchohol I have quite nice paying job.
I'm also a pretty cheap person and am able to save quite a bit of cash even tho I'm paying a massive loan for my house (as you may know houses in San Diego are pretty fucking expensive, my wife offered to also pay for the house but I want to keep paying for the house myself) and bought a certified 2017 bmw 750i.
Buying the bmw was not the best financial decision but I apsolutley addore the car. Since I got a new car, I of course sold my old car. It was a 2011 e class, and I was taking pictures of it just when my sister called me and said that the mechanic told her the fix woud cost more than the car is worth. When my sister heard that I was selling my car she somehow got the idea that I'm obligated to give her the car. I woud be completley fine with that if she pad, but my sister being my sister wanted it for free. Now, if the car was 20 years old and worth 800 dollars I woud give it to her, she is my sister after all. But the car is worth around 15 grand. Of course I sold the car, and my sister informed all of extended family about it. I thod that they woud once in their life be racional, as to be expected they failed to act as normal human beings again and started calling me cheap, an awful brother and many other wounderful names. I'm starting to think that I maybe shoud have just given her the car?",Not the A-hole

I’ve always thought of myself as pro choice, and my girlfriend and I agreed that if this situation were ever to happen she’d have an abortion, but after she got pregnant I talked to my older brother about what was happening and he told me I should reconsider because it was basically killing a baby. The long talk I had with him honestly changed my perspective, so I talked about it with my girlfriend.

I told her I wasn’t sure anymore what to do so she blew up at me and told me this whole situation was my fault anyway for pushing her to do it without a condom. We got into an argument and we eventually did agree that she should get the abortion and she scheduled the appointment. I realized how dumb my brother was being and that having an abortion is not “killing a baby”

But the day of the appointment turned out to be one where I didn’t have the car since my brother took it to work. I ended telling her I couldn’t come and not meeting her there and just texted afterwards to ask how she was.

She ended up at her parents’s house as she had taken an uber there and back, and called me a massive asshole for not being there. But I feel like it’s unfair because she was trying to blame me for everything. We haven’t talked since then. 

Edit: Want to clarify that I didn’t know my brother was going in to work that day and he was gone before I woke up, he didn’t know her abortion was that day. I realize uber was an option and I’m an idiot for not using it, I didn’t even realize about it until my girlfriend told me she’d taken it home. I know I’m an idiot for that",Asshole
AITA for telling my wife her not wanting to use a scale to track our progress in fitness is a redflag?,"So my new wife and I just started working out. I have a close relationship with her, she is my best friend and I have been with her for over a decade outside of marriage. We both are out of shape and I decided to buy a scale as a way to track weight for the fact that we want to work out, be healthy, etc.

When it arrived, she saw it and told me she wouldn't use it and would only be tracking her progress through body measurements because she doesn't want to know her weight. She told me she just had a conversation with her mom about never wanting to use a scale, and she would let me use it but refuses.

It seems like a red flag that she may back down on her commitment.

I am underweight (lost 40 pounds the last 6 months) and want to gain, she is overweight and wants to lose fat for those assuming I am using a metric that favors my loses...

The consensus is I am the asshole. I've apologized and told her I support whatever measurements of gains and losses she chooses.",Asshole
WIBTA for wearing a thong bikini to a beach party at the age of 35?,"I'm going to some carnival parties in Miami soon, and as many of you may know, the dress code for these parties is usually very skimpy.

I'm 35 but honestly I can pass for 25, I have a 7 year old daughter who is very smart and a wonderful child.

I've shown my sister some of the outfits I plan to wear (my friends and I are doing 3 parties), two are beach parties where I'll be wearing thongs.

My sister raged at me for being a bad mom and setting q bad example. Firstly, my daughter is in another state and even if she sees pics so what? I want her to have a healthy body image and if after the age of 16 she's confident enough to wear a thong bikini in an appropriate environment, then I'd support her.

My sister thinks it's ludicrous and that I need to dress and act my age, she even said doing these parties is irresponsible.

I love music, dancing and partying, this isn't something I'll stop anytime soon and why does society think women or mother's need to dress and behave like old prudes. Being a party girl doesn't make someone a bad mom. I'm always there for my daughter and that's why she's turning out to be such a wonderful person.

She even told me she'll miss me but she wants me to have fun and do things to make me happy. That maturity from a 7 year old is surprisingly nice.

The issue my sister has is my choice of dress. She is very aware that half of the women will be dressed similarly but she thinks as a mom, I shouldn't wear it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for saying the word BITCH to my gf,"To be clear, I did not call my gf a bitch , I just say it when I tell her things sometimes. Like, very occasionally. Like for example a lady is taking long to deliver my food , I say ""wow hurry up bitch"" or I'm headed to work and a client I dont like is there and Im on the phone with her and I say ""oh boy, that bitch is here"". A couple of times my gf has said she doesn't like that choice of words and other times she seems to ignore it and has said NOTHING. Very recently I sent her a chat stating that ""my sister is a real bitch""  She blew up on me and responded that she wanted to use this opportunity to make it very clear that she doesn't like when I use that word and that she doesnt want to read a chat message that says my sister is a bitch. I told her that I didn't mean it, which I didn't. 

I also told her that I dont know why she decided to tell me that all of a sudden after we've been together for a little over a year now. I told her that it feels like she's trying to censor me and that I guess now I'll just make a bleep noise when I want to say the word moving forward. She got mad and said that she didn't want me to use the word around her any longer and said that I was being sarcastic.

I mean I respect that she has this whole stance on it but like if someone is being a bitch then the context is correct, I don't see how thats bad. It doesnt hold any weight.

She told me thats not the point, the point is that it makes her uncomfortable. But , my point is true too, like if the context is there.

I say Quebec is in america and they speak French so it must be latin American. 

Now she says quebec isn't latin american because only south America and central america count, again she says ""didnt you go to school?"". I say mexico isn't latin american then because it's in north america. She says Mexico is in central America. I message 4 mexicans and ask them is Mexico north america or central, only two reply that it's north america. She says ""you should read more"" and sends me a link to Latin America on wikipedia. On the page it says some consider Quebec as latin American. I show her a screenshot of the page and she says ""Hispanics, don't you read what you define? And it says Belize which is colonized by canadians, but it doesnt say canada"" 

I then tell her you asked me latino not Hispanic. She says I'm frustrating and doesnt know how to make me understand. Again she says Belize was colonized by canada. I ridicule her saying I never heard anyone say something so stupid like that belize was colonized by canada or that Mexico is in central america as opposed to north America. She tells me to stop being ignorant and illiterate and that I should read more. I ask her ""ok tell me when exactly was belize colonized by canada?""

AITA for telling my sister that her voice sounds fake and annoying?,"My sister has been talking in a very annoying way for a year now. It seems very fake and coincides when she started to model. She used to talk more normally and less like a Barbie. If you want to hear what she sounds like, visit https://youtu.be/kh9CKpvPCcY.


I never make comments about other people’s voices, but I have to hear my sister talk whenever she comes back home. It really grinds my gears that she would be so fake. I have always just put up with it. No one in the family questioned it. 


However yesterday as my mom was talking to my sister on speaker phone, I told my sister that her voice sounds so fake and annoying. She didn’t say anything, but my mom told me that was incredibly rude and went outside to talk to her.


My mom came back in and asked me what that was for. I said my sister is putting on a fake voice for God knows what reason and asked her if she hasn’t notice. She said there’s nothing wrong with my sister trying to sound like that and she can do as she pleases. 


My sister texted me and asked me what’s up. I told her that no one is finding her new voice sexy at all, but rather annoying because it’s painfully fake. She said she hasn’t noticed a change in her voice and no one has criticized it except me. I’m pretty sure she’s lying but I let it slide.",Asshole
AITA for letting my neighbor’s dogs runaway?,"My neighbor “David” has been living next to us for the past ten years. Over these years, they’ve had 3 dogs which they keep out most of the time. They are obnoxiously loud, bark all morning and night until they’re brought in. The neighbor beside him who is my friend has been annoyed by it but when he confronted David about it, he just told him that he can’t control his dogs or bring them inside because they have dirt all over them and bring mud in from the yard. 

I recently got a job at a hospital a few years ago but the hours have been 7p-7a. Unfortunately, David has his dogs out around 6am every day when he leaves for work and they start barking and barking at the most insignificant things. I get it, they are dogs. That’s what they do. 

Anyway, I went over to his place finally and just gave it to him straight. I told him I work nights and would appreciate it if he could bring his dogs in just until noon or something since it’s hard for me to sleep with them barking. I don’t mind him letting them out for a bit but just not all day. I told him I’ve tried wearing earplugs (only in one ear because I can’t do both) and switching rooms but I still hear them. 

All he said was it’s the morning when everyone is awake and I have to deal with it because he can’t do anything about it. I asked if his wife (who’s a stay at home) could do me a favor and just let them out for a bit and take them back in but he said it’s not her problem. 

I never knew out of the ten years living beside him he would be that arrogant. If I was in his shoes, I think I would be considerate of someone who works nights and sleeps during the days. That’s just me. 

Anyway, I noticed a few weeks ago while coming back from work that his dogs were out of the fence and in the front yard. They saw me in my car and immediately started following me and barking. I didn’t know if his wife was outside somewhere or David himself, but after just stalling there for a few minutes I realized that they might have gotten out. So instead of parking my car, I slowly drove around the street with them following me as I was waving my hand at them. I got to a different street which is connected to the main road and then left, turned around and went back home. 

The following day when I woke up I didn’t hear anything. I assumed they got lost, and that’s what happened. I heard the doorbell ring in the afternoon while I was asleep and looked out the window to see who it was. It was David. I’m assuming looking for his dogs. I ignored it. I then see posts around the neighborhood looking for all three dogs saying they are lost. 

Now today, they still haven’t found them.  He did see me in person on my week off one day to tell me what happened and to look out for them, but I told him that’s it’s not my problem. He should’ve secured his fence. He told me to go fuck myself to which I did.",Asshole

Obviously all of these are great reasons to do a thing, but this particular thing is something I think is pretty gross...

AITA for finding it unacceptable for an associate to look like a teenager at a very high end retail store.,"Throwaway because I’ve posted on mens fashion subs and don’t want to get recognized.

There is a 19 year old female at our very high-retail store. I won’t disclose details, but she essentially got this job due to nepotism. We demand multiple years of high-end retail experience, while she has none.

She’s always doing wild and childish things to her hair. She’ll put it in two very high-puffs and do crazy things with her baby hairs. She once spent a week wearing her hair in 4 braids with these ball things because her mom showed her a picture of someone named brat. To top it off, she’ll put in clips, barrettes, colourful elastics.

We don’t have a policy against hair accessories or the hairstyles she wears but it’s a rule that shouldn’t be written. She should know that at her age. You can’t look like a teenager when you represent our store. This isn’t forever 21. She hasn’t violated any actual policies yet, but I believe she’s finding loopholes.

This affects how the customers interact with her. We have older clients. They either infantilize her or avoid her all together. She does not present herself as being capable of doing her job, and they do not perceive her such. The guests who don't  avoid her, are older women who say she looks precious, but never ask for her assistance.

This affects my job as well, I'm supposed to give her feedback on her performance, but I rarely see her perform.  I have limited feedback and it reflects poorly on my ability to do my job. When people do not ask her for assistance, this makes work harder for other employees. Why have more people on shift if they are still doing extra work.

I tried to address this at our lead meeting. One member of our team accused me of being racist and “adultifying her”. I’m aware of adultifiation but it doesn’t apply to other adults. He still insists that her race forces me to see as much older and I’m faulting someone for “not looking 25, when they aren’t 25”.

Then he accused me of only policing African textured hair.

This has nothing to do with race. But the equivalent of two high-puffs is two ponytails, which would be unacceptable. Im a man with long hair and if showed up with my babyhairs swirled all over, id look ridiculous. No one else does this but her. He completely ignored me and insists I’m uncomfortable with her blackness.

We didn’t discuss it further and won’t because of a potential HR case. However, after the meeting, some of team members approached and agreed with me. The accusation of racism was unwarranted and career damaging.

I hope you can all appreciate me giving the complete sides of each story instead of framing it for solely my perspective. I am part of the ""higher up"" team in our luxury retail store, so this is my business.",Asshole
AITA For distancing from my brother after he became paralyzed?," Let me start this by saying that I love my brother, I really do. We have always been very open and close to each other. Whenever I was upset or in danger he would always be there to cheer me up and protect me. 

This is why I really love him and when I heard that he became paralyzed (and is now on a wheelchair) I was so heart broken that I cried for weeks and couldn’t stop. I even had to avoid him completely the first few weeks because I didn’t want him to see me so devastated and nor did I want to see him like that as it would just make things worse for me. 

3 months passed and I still did not get over it. I still try my best to hide from him whenever I can. Yesterday was my birthday and I told my parents and brother from time that I won’t be doing a birthday party this time and will just hang out with my friends at a cafe for a few hours. The thing is, I lied. I actually did do a birthday party and invited many people. The reason why I didn’t invite my parents was because if I’d invite them I would also have to invite my brother and his presence would make me really uncomfortable. I want at least on my birthday to just forget about all my problems and be happy. 

My family found out I lied when one of my friends posted a picture of us together on Instagram. My brother called me and asked me why I did this and I told him the truth. He was so upset he didn’t say a single word and ended right there. I feel awful for this but at the same time I was really hoping he would understand. What do you guys think?",Asshole
AITA for causing my husband to crash and get fired?,"My DH (41m) and I (38f) recently had our first child at the end of last year.  He's an essential delivery driver, works for a supermarket chain (not America). I work part-full time from home (same situation as before, albeit a little less busy now). I'd been reading that men should take some responsibility for night feeds even if they work full-time. I work and take care of the baby full time when he's working you know? I'm lucky that my boss doesn't mind that I've got my baby with me as I work at the moment, I don't need to do any client/customer facing work.

So I'd been feeling very tired due to the night feeds and working and keeping up with the baby so I asked hubby if he wouldn't mind sharing the feeds 50/50 at night. He was reluctant at first because he said he couldn't be tired on the roads but I thought he was exaggerating and because the roads are much quieter now it shouldn't be a problem. I said I expected him to support me 50/50 as a father and help me out, that we need to share the responsibility for the night feeds. He's a good man so he started to do the feeds. Unfortunately last week he caused an accident on the road, noone was hurt luckily but it was pretty obvious he was at fault, he fell asleep waiting at a red light and panicked when someone blasted their horn at him and went into a post. 

Long story short they fired him, said that his performance had been off for a few weeks and that he was a danger to his colleagues and other road users. He hasn't explicitly blamed me but I can feel the undertones. 

AITA? Should I have accepted he needed sleep more than me? Now we only have my income and I'm worried with the record of the accident and the current situation he won't be able to find another job easily.

AITA for a kind of slut shaming joke I made?,"My friends and I have been in the same group since we were kids, so we know pretty much everything about each other. There's one girl, Gina, who's on the looser side and sleeps with a ton of people casually. None of us mind, of course, and she's really cool with it. 

She once told us a story about how she slept with 3 different dudes in one day and that story kinda stuck, cause there are some pretty funny tidbits. I've heard her repeat it many times in many settings and I've heard people in our group tease her about it even more often. But as I said, Gina's cool and always takes it in stride and has a laugh about it. 

We were all hanging out a few days ago and apart from the people in our core group, there were also a few extras. A couple of girlfriends (mine included), a boyfriend and some guys that weren't in our group (friends of friends and such). As I learned afterwards, Gina had really fancied one of those new guys for quite some time and wanted to pursue something with him.

Someone was telling a story at one point and I made a pun about Gina and her 3 guys (it's pretty much untranslatable in English, so I won't even try), which got a big laugh all around, except by the people who had never heard her story. That kinda put Gina on the spot because these people wanted to get in on the joke, but she didn't feel like sharing this time.

She spent the rest of the night not talking to me or my girlfriend and she's apparently still angry at me, cause she hasn't responded to my and my girlfriend's attempts to contact her. That's when our friends explained that she was interested in someone there and that I probably doomed her with that joke, though they think it will pass.

I realize I put her on the spot and that, in all likelihood, I blew up her chances with that guy, but a) that wasn't my intention, and b) the same thing (teasing her about that night) had happened countless times, even with other people in the group. 

AITA here?

edit: I should clarify, because judging from the first few comments I don't think people got something.

**I didn't share her story**. I just made a pun, a reference to it. My joke indicated some promiscuity, but I didn't single Gina out. I made the joke and everyone laughed and instinctively looked at her. 

It's just that my joke had such a good reaction that the people who didn't get it wanted to know more, and they kinda figured out it had to do with Gina since everyone was looking at her.",Asshole
AITA for getting upset with my gf because she wants to take pole dancing lessons?,"My girlfriend (22f) and I (26m) have been together for 2 years. 

We’ve both started going to the gym a lot and in the last year or so we’ve gotten into really good shape. The other day she told me that she’s been wanting to take pole dancing classes for a long time like since before she met me. She said that now her body is at a point where she’s confident enough to actually try it out. 

She explained to me that she knows there’s still a lot of stigma around pole dancing and it being associated with stripping still. She says it’s become a whole other sport of its own with a lot of women doing it as a form of workout class. She wants to work out, it seems fun to her and she wants to feel sexy doing it. 

I understand the logic behind what she is saying, trust me I do. I’m really trying hard to not sound like an asshole here. But the thought of her wearing booty shorts and stripper heels doing sexy dances in front of other people just really makes me uncomfortable. I understand that it has become a really popular form of dance that requires a lot of skill and strength and I recognize that. 

However this still doesn’t change the fact that it’s what strippers do and I just don’t feel comfortable with her showing herself off that way to other people. I don’t have anything against strippers just please try and understand where I’m coming from. I love my girlfriend and I try to support her in everything she does. But this one just isn’t going to be something I can get behind. 

I expressed all of this to her and she got upset with me saying I was being ridiculous and overreacting. She said it’s not like there’s a bunch of guys that just sit and watch the classes and it’s usually only women there anyway. I suggested if she wanted to get into dance there were so many kinds that maybe we could reach a compromise and choose a different kind that wasn’t pole dancing. 

She’s currently not speaking to me beyond small talk and whatever she does say comes out cold and short. I feel like an asshole for making her feel this way and I’ve tried to reason with myself as to why I’m not ok with it. Obviously I’m not explicitly telling her that she can’t do it, I’m not stopping her and she can do what she wants. 

I just know that she likes to have my support and approval when it comes to stuff and me not approving of it won’t let her enjoy it even if she did do it. I just can’t get over my discomfort. AITA? 

EDIT: while I value everyone’s opinion I would also like to hear from guys who have girlfriends or wives and how they would react if they were in my position. I also don’t need anyone telling me that I think strippers are bad or any of that just please try and understand where I’m coming from

EDIT 2: everyone saying I’m being controlling needs to read things more carefully. I NEVER told her no and I never said she’s not allowed. I do not control what my girlfriend does and does not do. She is free to do what she wants. I am not stopping her from going and taking a class right now. I expressed that I would prefer it if she did not do it but I never told her she couldn’t.

AITA for telling my friend her degree is useless?,"So my best friend of 15+ years is graduating college in a year so we were talking about moving in together. I wanted to leave the state and she wanted to go to to a city out of state about 4-5 hours away. I didn't want to go there as it is expensive and still within the region I didn't want to live(I wanted to get away from the snow and she agreed). But whenever i mentioned a place that had almost everything she wanted it was always ""too far"". She insisted we lived in a big city because she has a Musical Theater degree and she kept saying she could only get a job in theaters.

I tried telling her that if we lived in a big city she'd have a hard time getting a job and she might want to look at a higher paying labor job or a job where she can use her English degree until she can get a job at a theater. She kept saying that wouldn't work because she wanted to work in a theater. 

I suggested Nashville, Tennessee as it is the music capital of the United States and it was out of the midwest so we didn't have to worry about snow as much. She just kept saying that she cant go to Nashville because it was too far, that it didn't have a musical theater scene, or that Tennessee is trashy so she cant live there. 

I admittedly got frustrated and in a harsher tone than was probably necessary I told her she can't just will herself her dream job and that she needs to make money instead of relying on her useless degree. She got incredibly upset and told me I was just lashing out because she didn't like my ideas.

She then said I just being mean and that her degree isn't useless but if she explained why I would just be mean to her. She kept saying she cant move that far because her parents won't let her and that shes too scared. 

I admitted that it's scary to move a 12+ hour drive away from home but that if we want everything we want we'd have to do that. I then accused her of being too codependent on her parents and she told me not to talk to her until I was done being mean. 

I texted her this morning telling her that it shouldn't matter what I think about her degree, I still think it's useless, but if she doesn't think so then to move on. I reminded her that I dont have to like everything she does and everything about her and we can just avoid talking about her degree and we wont move in together. I told her this doesn't have to end almost 2 decades of friendship but she won't move past it and keeps telling me I'm just being mean and I have anger issues. 

So am I the asshole?

Edit: this is not me defending myself in any way, I'm totally fine admitting that I am the asshole here and apologizing to her. But I wanted to say that I told her in her first year that I didn't think her degree was a good idea but I have supported her nonetheless. I have gone to every one of her shows and I believe in her dreams and I tell her that all the time. I was just fed up with the fact that she didn't seem interested in hearing that she would have a hard time getting a theater degree. 

The codependent thing was definitely me lashing out  and I've already apologized to her for that. 

But I get it, I'm the asshole and I'm fine with that. I will be apologizing to her and trying to approach this like the adults we are.

Edit2: I do not have a degree because college was so far out of the picture for me I couldn't even find the frame. I'm very open about the fact that I think College in general is a scam unless you are getting a medical/law/stem degree. 

I instead got a labor job that I am very happy with and love.

Edit3: I've since apologized to her. I realized long before this post that we weren't going to be able to live together. 

Also to clarify my views on college: if you choose to go to college good for you. I just believe that spending money to learn something that you could learn for free online/get an apprenticeship for is a waste. 

We are still friends but I made the decision to put some space between us because even I know I have some issues to work on. Which she agreed to.",Asshole
AITA for leaving my 6mo old outside unattended?,"I (35m) promised my wife (27f) I would get up with the baby so she could sleep in before I left for work.

It worked and she was happy out there, playing for two hours until my wife woke up. 

Wife comes into the living room, and obviously doesn’t see the baby so she asks me where she is. When I told her she was on the back porch, my wife flips out, and rushes to go get her. She kinda goes off on me, saying it was irresponsible and I’m not supervising her and basically saying she could have gotten hurt. But we live on the third floor, and she was in a walker she can’t move - it’s not like she was going to climb out the walker, or someone was going to take her.

I’m currently active duty Navy serving with a small boat team (SWCC) out of Coronado. My job is basically to drive fast boats with big guns. The training pipeline I had to go through is very similar to the SEAL pipeline, but it’s obviously not the same. I was at a bar a week or two ago when I was approached by a woman. We struck up a friendly conversation and she asked me if I was a service member (seeing as I have a USN anchor tattooed on my forearm) and I replied yes. She asked me what my rating was and I told her that I’m a special warfare operator (I’m not) to impress her. She got skeptical and started questioning me about all this SEAL shit (apparently her ex boyfriend was a SEAL) and I decided it was too late to backpedal and decided to keep up the lie, since I knew all the answers to her questions, having worked with SEALs. Eventually she got really frustrated and I told her she was acting bitchy so we both left.

first time posting here, so i feel like this is going to be brutal but here goes:

&#x200B;

I am a software engineer at a big tech company (think big 5).  Our team only has headcount for one more person this year (we already hired 2).  I interviewed this college new grad who I really liked and advocated for.  For those who don't know the tech industry, generally the candidate goes through 3-5 interviews with different people, then we all sit together in a room and vote.   She was voted down cause my manager wanted someone with more experience; no big deal, happens all the time.

&#x200B;

A few weeks later, I interview another new grad for the same role.  She was objectively worse than the first candidate (lower grades, failed the coding interview, no relevant experience), yet everyone voted to extend an offer because of reasons you'd know if you lived in a US city.  I couldnt object because it'd be career suicide, but I was bitter because the candidate I liked a week ago was rejected on the grounds that we wanted someone with ""more experience"", yet we hired one with less.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months since the offer, and now she's onboarding with our team.  The system we work on is quite complex, so new hires tend to need their hand held for the first few months, but she asks a *ton* of questions.  In her case, it's even worse because she doesn't have C++ experience (the language our system is written in).  But I just can't get myself to help her.  I'm not rude nor do I go out of my way to impede her success, but I only answer like 20% of the copious amount of questions she asks and don't point out bugs in her code because deep down, I want her to get fired because she took the job away from someone who deserved it more.  The worst part is, she's a friendly person, just noticeably incompetent.  In a different setting, I'd like to be her friend, just not her coworker.

&#x200B;

\[edit: a lot of people are making it a political thing, which i'd like to avoid.  i'd just like to know my obligation in this situation.  removed irrelevant bits to focus on what i should be doing\].

AITA for cutting my parents out my life after I found out they weren’t going to leave my their house in their will?,"I know the titles makes me sound entitled or spoiled but I’m not. Hear me out.

I am an only child and my parents both worked full time jobs for most of my life. I had to pretty much raise myself. I had to get myself ready for school, make my own lunches and often my own dinners as both my parents worked a lot of overtime. Regardless of my struggles I was able to overcome it and become a quality member of society. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in acting. Which I am still working on to this day. I work full time as an electrician and since I live in LA I barely make it. All I can afford is a crappy studio apartment but that’s ok I’m happy with my life because I am going to be a successful actor one day and money won’t mean anything to me.

Anyways I left home a while ago and don’t see my parents too often, we talk occasionally on the phone but other than that we don’t really communicate. The other day I was visiting them and my mother informed me that both she and my father were going to be retiring within the next year and then they would be renting the house out while they traveled around the world. That got us to talking about the house more and my mother said that after they traveled for a while they were gonna likely sell the house and buy property somewhere in Italy or Spain and retire comfortably by some beach. 

I then said “what about me” and my mother says “what about you?” Aren’t I going to get anything from you guys? The house was supposed to go to me when you guys died.” My mother chucked and said “why would we give you the house? You never put any work or money into it. Your father asked for your help on the garage and you said no. So why would we leave the house to you?” I was shocked she was saying this to me. And I go “well because that’s your obligation. It’s what parents do. You guys own that house. Are you at least going to give me any money when you sell it?” Again my mother laughed and said “of course not, you’re gonna be an actor right? You’re gonna have your own money why do you need ours. Besides we will need it to buy property abroad.” 

I stood there shocked and said “what am I gonna with property abroad when you guys die?” My mother then says we won’t be leaving it to you, in our wills that property will go to some charities”.

At that point I turned around and just walked away. I could believe what she said. As I was about to walk out the door I looked back at my mother and told her from this moment on she and my father were dead to me and then I left. I kind of feel bad now. Was I the one in the wrong here?",Asshole
AITA For not letting an alcoholic buy liquor at my family's store?,"My dad owns a convenient store that sells liquor. Around 2-3 times a week, this middle aged haggard guy comes in and buys multiple bottles of whiskey/beer, etc. If that weren't an indication he is an alcoholic, his hands are always shaking when he uses his credit card.

I am the only one who works there during a lot of shifts. And I am tired of letting him give in to his addiction. So yesterday he came in again and I told him I refuse to sell to him. He got annoyed and was arguing with me. There was a small line behind him that he was holding up.

I told him ""you're a drunk, get the fuck out before I call the police."" He pleaded with me that he needs the liquor to hold off his withdrawals. Now I've known heroin addicts who got clean and I realize suffering through withdrawals is uncomfortable, but it's needed.

So I told him ""well sir, sometimes we need to put on our big boy pants and muster through the pain.""

He kept asking me to let him buy the liquor just the one time but I told him he's banned from the store. He called me a child as he walked out and I yelled to him to go get cirrhosis from another store if he wants it that bad. 

My father told me I have no right to ban his customers and they can get whatever they want. But I told him it's a moral wrong to let him keep buying alcohol and I was doing him a massive favor.",Asshole
AITA for watching south park?,"My sister had a couple of her friends over, my family and her friends are all super ""uptight"" and hates anything vulgar.  I don't want to sound mean or like I'm trying to bash religion but they are super religious.  I have never been religious, I grew up going to church but I don't have to do that anymore.   

So she had her friends over and they were in her room, I was watching south park on the TV.  They came outside and saw me watching that and got uncomfortable.  When they left my sister said I'm TA for watching that when she had friends over knowing that they don't like that stuff.  I told her that I can watch what I want in my house.  She told me to be a little accommodating and I told her ill mute it when they are in the living room.  She was annoyed that I wouldn't just turn it off but she knew I wasn't gonna budge any more.

AITA for asking my mum to stop taking me out to non vegan places for our monthly dinners?,"So I’m a disabled vegan (she/her pronouns) who lives with her boyfriend. My mum and I are pretty close but she is pretty ignorant on my vegan lifestyle even though she does try and understand. 

She doesn’t make much money (she’s a teaching assistant) but every month she saves up enough to take me and her out for a girly dinner date. Each time without fail she will pick somewhere like Nandos where I *could* get a vegan dinner but I’d honestly prefer if we went somewhere 100% vegan run for moral and ethical reasons. 

Like I said I’m disabled and can’t work so as much as I’d like to take her out I can’t. I’ve suggested before restaurants we can give a go (we live in London!! There are loads!!) but she gets upset and tells me she can’t afford their prices for meals she won’t even enjoy. 

I asked her again this week reminding her I’d rather go somewhere vegan and she actually said to me on the phone ‘I’m really sorry Holly but I think this month we’ll have to leave it, I just don’t think you’re being grateful about our dates’. 

I’m really upset and I feel like she’s not respecting me BUT I am open to constructive criticism if I’m in fact being ungrateful.",Asshole
AITA for laughing at hindu deities in class?,"Yesterday, my history teacher was talking about religion and it's importance and influence throughout history. He then put a documentary that was talking about all the major world religions, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and their origins and some of their traditions, customs, beliefs etc. Tbh, i wasn't really paying much attention and was just quietly taking with my friend who sits next to me. When the Hinduism part came, it was showing some of the gods or idols or whatever that hindus pray to, my friend next to me started making some, admittedly inappropriate jokes, like ""dude this religion is so weird, they literally pray to like blue people statues, and monkey and elephant gods and stuff like that"", this kind of made me chuckle, and when the gods appeared on the screen, I was finding it difficult to stop myself from laughing but I lost it when my friend started whispering in my ear and said something along the lines of ""look its the monkey god they pray to, Ganesha"". I lost it and started laughing uncontrollably for probably a few minutes, but it honestly felt like forever. People were just silently looking at me, and it was really uncomfortable but I couldn't help myself. I think this offended some of the hindu kids in my class, as they were whispering to each other and constantly looking over at me , giving me dirty looks.

After class ended, my teacher told me stay back for a while, and told me what I did was inappropriate and that I should never laugh or ridicule someone's faith, he then said that while I'm a good kid, he expects an apology to the whole class tomorrow and specifically apologize to the kids I offended. I told him that while I do think I should have tried harder to control myself, I would not be apologizing for a few reasons, but mostly because its beneath me and even if I did, I would probably burst out laughing again as I tend to do that in awkward and uncomfortable situations. He just shot me a dirty look and angrily left the class, and I went to my next class after that.

While I would be willing to maybe write a letter apologizing there's no way I'm going to do in front of the whole class as I explained it's beneath me and I might start laughing again. So AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: There's a little misunderstanding, I AM willing to apologize, JUST NOT IN PUBLIC OR ORALLY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I am willing to maybe write a letter and distribute it to the hindu kids in my class

AITA for telling off my roommate?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons but I need to know if I’m wrong here. Yesterday I overheard my roommate talking shit about me not doing the dishes for the past few months. And while she’s right, I have a good reason for it. I’m an essential worker and since I’m so high risk, the last thing I want to do after a long day of work is do the dishes. I explained this to her and she said  she’d take over my duties so I don’t know what her deal is!

Today she came to me and asked to talk, I said sure and she basically said that since the country has reopened she’s done with doing my share of the chores and wants me to take them over again. I find that ridiculous! Yes, everything’s reopened (way too soon imo) but that doesn’t mean I should have to sacrifice my mental health. So I said, “you know you’re constantly riding my ass about my hygiene but I never bring up yours. You’re like 3 times my size and take shorter showers than me, what’s up with that??” Her eyes welled with tears and she left. Now she’s staying with a friend.

I told my friend what happened and she called me a jerk. Honestly, I don’t see the big deal. She IS 3 times my size (I’m 100 pounds and she’s probably 300) and she said it was fine for her to take over my share of the chores! Honestly, she probably IS dirty I take nice 20 minute showers and she maybe takes 10 minute showers on a good day. She doesn’t stink but I don’t think she’s clean.

"AITA for telling my dangerously overweight classmate, what are the medical disadvantages of being dangerously overweight?","A little backstory: I am in the 9the grade of a german ""Gymnasium"". We have one overweight kid in our class and I don't mean like a little chubby, I really do mean morbidly obese (around 90-100 kilograms). It should also be told that I'm underweight(I eat much, but I don't really gain weight)
So the problem is that she isn't aware of the effects that being obese has, furthermore one of my classmates actually encourages her with ""body positivity"". So one day we have projects about ""health"" and how we treat our bodys and I decided to take the chance and talk about obesity. Mind you I tried talking to my teacher about it, which resulted in me getting detention (I could probably have fought it, but I didn't want to cause an big uproar, since I already struggle with confrontations and talking to larger Groups of people). So the day of the biology project rolls around and I present my presentation. I present my presentation with scientific facts, that I researched. Like the higher chance of Diabetes Typ 2, High blood pressure,  different types of cancer etc. After the presentation she started crying and I needed to go to detention again, because it was ""unacceptable behaviour""
Am I the asshole here?

"AITA for constantly correcting my mom for referring to Pokémon as ""Pikachu""?","My mom seems to be one of those boomers that always uses genericized trademarks, I remember as a kid my brother got angry at her for calling his Playstation a ""Nintendo"". However despite this correction she instead explained genericized trademarks and then repeated the exact same sentence calling it a Nintendo, causing him to throw a fit and storm off. This later stopped with later consoles. I also remember once her mocking him for referring to a store brand bandage as a  ""band-aid"". Anyway she also knows only one Pokémon and obviously it's Pikachu. I got a little annoyed hearing her talk about the ""Pikachu cartoon"" and ""Pikachu movies"" when I was kid, but granted Pikachu is a main character in them so I didn't really push it.

Recently when I was with her I was playing Pokémon Go and she would ask things like ""oh did you run off to catch Pikachu?"" and I corrected her, I ran off to catch an Oddish, not Pikachu. Everytime she made a reference to ""Pikachu"" I would correct her and say the generic term is ""Pokémon"". She still kept saying Pikachu stubbornly. I just kept correcting her. Eventually she broke down and just sternly told me it's pretty clear what she means when she says ""Pikachu"". I'm too much of a fan to let this slide so I stood my ground and said her terminology wasn't correct. FYI I'm like this in general, I get annoyed at people saying they live in ""Minneapolis"" when they actually live in a suburb for example (I live in actual Minneapolis.)

Anyways long story short was with this girl for 9 years. We had 2 daughters together. I was 16 and she was 19 when we had our first. We had a long relationship most of which we were both pretty much kids. We both did terrible things to each other and it was toxic but we loved each other. Anyways while we were together we took thousands of videos and pictures of sexual acts that were not really your normal stuff.  Kind of extreme fetish type stuff. She always told me stuff like she would never cheat on me she loved me more than anything blah blah blah. In response almost jokingly because of how extreme the acts we were doing I would tell her if she ever did cheat on me that I would post them. At one point she was even into the idea of being posted online and we posted a bunch of things on reddit and other places etc. I have verification photos as proof when we did it.


Ok so 2 years ago we were obviously doing terrible I fucked up in more ways than you can imagine and I lost the only person I ever loved besides my kids. She told me she didn’t love me anymore on my birthday, afterwards spent 6 months cheating on me with one of her co workers whom she always told me not to worry about. Guy was divorced cheated on his wife. 10 years older than me etc. I caught her cheating on me a week before Christmas. I was in shock. She left me for him took my kids broke the lease on our house. Immediately brought him around my daughters. Took all the money I had. Took everything really.

Went on multiple vacations out of state with this man with my money not one or two but a dozen. Looked happier than I’ve ever seen her flashed this man and his son off to everyone pretty much replaced me in my daughters lives with this man I mean brought this guy to their cheerleading practices that I used to go to. Field trips with teachers that had taught both of our girls and had seen me pick them up from school. 

I was homeless I lost everything I lost my mind my heart. I never had any family besides them. 

I had these pictures and im 100% the asshole because I posted them but is she not the asshole too? Am I just fucking crazy. This is fucked up I know.

AITA for expecting my father (51m) to be supporting me (18f) throughout my university years?,"My mom was quite well to do so she bought a lot of insurance plans for me and saved up a lot of money for me. I think about 10 my mom left my dad and went to stay with my aunt because of their failing marriage. Ever since then, my dad would only visit me about a month and my mom would complain about how my dad wasn’t paying money or being a more involved parent. (they aren’t officially divorced or separated so there isn’t any child support to be paid) 

Yea well about 12 my mom died of cancer and my aunt has been taking care of me ever since. i honestly had the worst relationship with my father ever since then and i barely saw him for months even. my aunt was a single mom who had her own son to take care of and she was paying for everything. my dad would give about 4k like every 2-3 months. whatever insurance my mom had for me, as it couldn’t be paid up before she died my aunt even cancelled her own insurance so she could pay for mine and my dad rarely paid. during all this time my dad was in a good financial position (idk his job was okay) and honestly at that age your dad buying u phones and games and clothes were the best thing and i never realised he didn’t actually provide for me (this is the later part where my relationship with my dad improved). 

now i’m 18 and my aunt can’t really support me anymore so i had to move back with my dad. our relationship is fine and i’ve been working before i get into university (1.5k in 3 months). i don’t intend to use any of this money and it’s just my savings in case something happens because i don’t think my dad saves money. my dad lost his job and is driving grab and we also rent 2 rooms in our house (he’s fucking renting it below market price because they are his friends but i can’t even be bothered to discuss with him about it) is it unfair for me to expect my father to provide for me through university like pocket money etc and also renovate my room? i’m gonna use my mother’s saving to pay for my university fees. i want to ask him for about 850 to minimal 600 per month. and since i’ve moved back into the house i want to buy new furniture for myself because all the furniture in my room is the same furniture i left when i was 10. i fully expect him to purchase the bigger items like bed and table but smaller things like laundry baskets, clothes hanger i’ll buy myself. i know that this will definitely make money abit more tight for him but honestly i could give less of a fuck because he’s just been so absent from my life majority of the time and it’s now time to pay up, especially if he wants to be in my life. i just don’t think it’s fair for him to be claiming to be my father but only contributing to my life about 15% while my aunt was doing all 85% and literally using her own savings to pay for me.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to move to the deep south for my husband's job?,"I'm 34F, husband is 35M. Husband is the bread winner in our family, he's an engineer. We have two kids (3 + 6 year old boys) He has been at the same company for 7 years and he's decided to move on. We both want to move from California and he's getting sick of his job anyway.

So last month he took a couple weeks off and flew out to the east coast to interview at a bunch of different engineering firms. He has a very unique skillset and is very much so in demand in his industry. Now I knew he would be interviewing at a couple companies in the south but I didn't think that much of it, I figured he would go there and nope out once he saw how backwards it is down there.

Well you can see where this is going. He got an offer at a firm in Atlanta and he would be making almost twice as much. He told me he wants to take it and my heart just sunk. We're obviously both very liberal, and the idea of moving out to Trump country and raising our kids in a racist, ultra religious and super conservative place makes me shudder. I told him my concerns but he insisted that I would really like Atlanta, and he offered to take me there (just us) to visit to try and convince me. I told him no, this is out of the question, we will not be moving to the deep south, period, end of story. My friends and parents also think he's insane for wanting to move our family there. 

My husband is extremely pissed at me and thinks I'm being unreasonable. I told him surely he can find another company elsewhere and get a similar offer. I don't like that he's using the fact that he's the bread winner to try and uproot us somewhere I don't want to live. I can't imagine our kids growing up in a place with such prejudice, and the lack of diversity (something I like about where we live in California) is also a huge problem too. Never mind how unhealthy and poorly educated Georgia is too.

AITA for suggesting that my injury might have been as painful or more painful than a pregnancy?,"My wife had some friends from her mommy group over yesterday. I was talking to them, we were all having a good time. The conversation shifted to their pregnancy experiences. Obviously as a man I have never been pregnant, so I just didn't say anything and listened. Until a friend noticed me being quiet and said ""OP is so quiet, he must be so thankful to not have to go through any of this. And besides I don't think he could handle the pain"". It was a tongue in cheek comment so I laughed along with the rest of them.

I then said that while of course I'll never be pregnant, I've experienced something that might be as painful as, if not more, a pregnancy. I went on to describe the time that I dislocated my elbow while skiing. While the actual injury itself wasn't as bad, once the adrenaline wore off and I was in the ambulance - which was driving over an extremely rocky and bumpy road at top speed - the bones in my arm were rattling against each other. Laughing gas and morphine did nothing to help the pain and most of all the discomfort of feeling your bones grind against each other. Eventually I actually blacked out from the pain - no small thing because my pain tolerance is sky high.

Some of the women nodded and said yeah that sounds like a terrible experience, they sympathized with me, yada yada. We had a pleasant night and we all parted ways amicably. My wife, on the other hand, said she didn't appreciate making it all about myself. And I was like well I was just presenting my side of things, it doesn't mean I invalidated what y'all went through.

AITA for killing a butterfly in my office that one of my co-workers believed it was her dead mother?,"So. I work in a small office building and during the summer it gets very very hot inside. We have a wasp problem and insect problem in general. So last week we had HUGE butterflies coming in through the windows for literally the entire week.

Now I absolutely hate butterflies, they're fluffy, big and they fly. They've been distracting me from my work all week and on the Thursday I decided that it went on for too long and I was seriously at breaking point. The heat didn't help.

I tried killing one of them near the beginning of the week but some of my co-workers would tell me not to because ""you don't kill butterflies"", which I didn't question I just waved it out the window.

So I managed too instantly kill it on the wall after having enough, I swear it was the same one all week. So then my co-workers start getting on at me and apparently one of them thought it was their dead mother and the rest of them believe that butterflies are dead people, that's why they said I shouldn't kill them.

People can have their beliefs all they want but to me it's completely rediculous. I didn't know this was a thing.

AITA for testing a stranger's character and asking to borrow something harmless?,"I was at Taco Bell today behind a family of 5, and there was nobody else in line.

As he was finishing his transaction and everyone else was getting drinks, he put his credit card into the chip reader. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked, ""May I please borrow your card?"" He laughed derisively and looked at me funny and said no. I clarified that I meant the discount card, not the credit card, and was met with another derisive laugh as he took his card out and walked away.

I held up my card to the cashier and told her that I had the card, I was just testing him to see if he would let me borrow it. I figured it would be harmless, since it literally costs him nothing to let me use it. Given his reaction, though, I might have been out of line.

AITA for having nothing to do with wife's funeral because she had an affair even though I inherited her estate,"Two weeks before my wife died I found a sex tape she made with her affair partner and messages they wrote to each other about how horrible a husband I was and that I was lucky to be married to her. I showed it to her and threatened to send it to everyone in our lives if she didn't leave right then. She spent the next few days texting me nonstop. The last time I saw my wife she showed up at my apartment begging me to take her back I refused. Later that night she got into a car accident and didn't make it.  I was emotional but I just keep telling myself she was dead to me already. 
 
My aunt in law reached out, offered her condolences and asked about the funeral. I told her for private reasons I can't plan my wife's funeral and I think it's best that she and my wife's sisters plan it instead.

 My wife comes from old money and when her parent's died she and her sisters received money in the seven figures and various properties. My wife never touched her money, she didn't want to live off her inheritance as we made enough to live comfortably. So, she just rented out her properties. She saved the money for emergencies. As her husband, I inherited all her assets. I'm moving into one of her properties and plan to live off her estate. This normally wouldn't be an issue but her family is upset that I'm not attending her funeral and they are seeing this as an insult to injury kind of thing. 

The harassment was the worst on her funeral. After so much hate I post a her sex tape and told everyone this is why I don't want anything to do with her funeral. This shut some people up but now people are saying I went too far. I feel like my actions were justified. Like I was trying to preserve her image to her friends and family, something I had no obligation to do and my repayment was all this vitrol. So I was like fuck it, I don't deserve this hate, my wife damn sure doesn't deserve her secret kept and her family lost there right to the preservation of her image when they harassed me. I don't feel like an AH but some of our mutual friends think I went too far?

edit: the reason I didn't bother telling them is because none of them would beleive me. My wife was very much a golden child growing up. They believe she was virgin at our wedding night so there was no way they'd believe she'd have an affair and make a sex tape without seeing the tape.",Asshole
AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend because she wouldn’t take a shot?,"I (26m) have been with my girlfriend (25f) for 5 years. We live in the U.S. and we were both born here but my family is originally from Turkey. I usually go to turkey to visit family every 2 years, and we’ve been together for a while and have a great relationship so I decided to invite her to meet my family in Turkey.

Before we went I told her one rule she would need to follow. The one rule was do not refuse anything if you are offered, such as food and drinks, it is considered extremely disrespectful and rude. She agreed and said she would and that would be no big deal.

When we arrived, my uncle picked us up from the airport and went to his house. When we got settled in he brought out a bottle of moonshine, 3 shit glasses and offered us a shot. We obliged but when she brought it to her face, she didn’t like the smell and didn’t take it. (She drinks alcohol, so it’s nothing new to her for taking shots) Sure the shot was horrible but these people live in poverty and this is gold to them, and she disrespected my family for not taking it. So I pulled her aside to talk to her and was like,” what did I say the only rule was before coming here, I don’t care if it’s gross, you just have to take one” She started crying and calling me an asshole, so now I’m here asking you guys, am I really the asshole?

TLDR; girlfriend refused shot that my uncle in turkey offered us after she agreed to my only rule; you take what is offered to you.",Asshole
AITA for not inviting my brother to son's birthday?,"I was trying to avoid conflict, but I don't know if I made things worse in doing so.

The thing is, my husband and brother don't get along. My brother is gay, husband is on the religious side and doesn't like it when my brother brings his partner for family reunions or events. They're both stubborn though, so they can't even play nice for the sake of others. They usually end up either arguing or passively-aggressively avoiding each other. I didn't want them to find a reason to fight during our son's birthday party. For context, son just turned 4 and we invited some relatives and friends over to celebrate.

Therefore I didn't tell my brother about the celebration because I know him - he'd want to visit despite the fact that my husband and he would find some way to make a scene, like they do every time. We held the birthday party with my in-laws and a few neighborhood kids. When my brother asked about bringing a present after work, I told him to come then and didn't mention the party. That way no-one would be hurt, son would get to hang out with his uncle, and there would be no needless arguing (husband works afternoon shifts, they wouldn't meet).

However, my brother found out through a conversation with our parents about the party and now he won't talk to me or come over to see his nephew. He's convinced I'm taking husband's side and trying to turn son against him and his partner. I'm not though; I just didn't want their petty fighting to ruin my kid's birthday. He doesn't need to be a part of that.

Was I the asshole for my behavior here? Honestly, I don't believe so and I think he's being selfish in putting the disagreements with my husband before his nephew.",Asshole

AITA for asking my pregnant wife to dress more modestly?,"My wife is 5.5 months pregnant with our first child. She recently ordered some maternity dresses which were sort of provocative. I mean like, so skin tight, that you can see the outline of her belly button in some of them.  You can see the outline of every body part (breasts, ass, thighs) and her bump sticking out clearly. Even though she's not revealing any skin, because of the way her body is shaped  (thin with big tits and hips, with the belly bump) it makes her look quite sexual. I don't want her to attract the wrong kind of attention because I know how men think, and there are some weird people out there with pregnancy fetishes, etc. I do notice other men looking at her when we're out and it makes me uncomfortable. Also, in our culture, the bump is supposed to be covered otherwise it could attract the 'evil eye'.  She shows her bump on purpose, and I'm questioning why, it's almost like she knows she gets attention and enjoys it. I don't want my wife/unborn baby to be sexually objectified by random men so I told her she should dress comfortably, and modestly and now she is upset with me. AITA?",Asshole

She said that she’s been working all day and that we’re all adults that could make our own food. I got a little annoyed and said that she needed to stick to her word and that that’s what she’s supposed to do. She then cursed me out and told me to act my fucking age, and she also said that she made many other sacrifices for me my whole life. I then told her that I never asked to be born.

AITA for lying about my age when dating?,"I'm a 19 yo male, but about 5 years ahead of average education/career wise and 20+ ahead financially. On tinder as well as longer term dating apps I put my age as 25 since most 25ish yo women filter people younger than them. I have tried dating people my own age but I feel like I'm taking advantage of them and the huge difference in life experience makes it so we have nothing in common.

Anyway, I tell the truth about 3 dates in and have never had a negative reaction, most girls are very understanding.

AITA for not caring that my friend is going through a really difficult time?,"Background: Both 23F. I have this one friend who lacks the ability to show empathy in any situation. Met her at work. Last year when my boyfriend dumped me out of no where she made me feel bad for not moving on fast enough and would make me feel judged for the way my depression was making me feel and act. I didn't really address any of this with her, just sort of stopped telling her things and stopped considering her a close friend.

She and her boyfriend of 2 years broke up two weeks ago and she's been a wreck about it. Honestly I don't really consider her much of a close friend after seeing how uncaring she is when other people are going through difficult times so I personally feel like I don't have to put much energy into her. She tries to talk to me about him and her feelings about the situation and I'll talk to her but I'm not going out of my way like I would for my other friends.

We get lunch together at work sometimes, and she started talking about her BF again and I was kind of giving bare minimum responses and she made some sassy comment about how I'm acting like a dick and it's obvious to her that I don't care. I was taken aback but I politely told her something along the lines of ""I get that you're going through a really hard time and I truly do get it, but last year when I literally fell into a depression you made me feel terrible for not handling in the way you wanted me to, and would constantly get frustrated that I 'wouldn't just move on'"". She told me to stop being an AH and playing tit for tat and just left.

Edit. Wow 😲

Edit 2: I hate driving. The fact that she doesn’t drive puts all the burden on me. The fact that she just gets to sit there the entire time, while I’m doing 100% of the work is BS.  All costs  during the drive should be spilt including tickets and if that makes me an asshole. I guess it is what it is.",Asshole
AITA For Complaining About A TA Wearing Revealing Clothing?,"I had an exam yesterday afternoon, class of about 50 people. A TA was there handing out the exams and invigilating and she looked like she was about to hit the club up after, now she's really hot and slimthick. But I just don't think it was appropriate to wear to work, especially in this scenario where it was distracting. Her tits were out and when she came around to sign people in everyone was staring and it was distracting because she'd walk around and everyone would look. Even the girls were looking as she walked by, so it wasn't only me.

After the exam I spoke to my prof about this and complained and he said he can't do anything about that. My friend said I'm an ass for getting distracted by her and complaining.

AITA For giving my girlfriend an ibuprofen?,"Throwaway because my girlfriend knows my main.

I (30M) have been living with my girlfriend (27F) for a while and mostly it’s been great. The problem is this: she gets tension headaches from time to time. Not too often, but often enough. The way she prefers to deal with these headaches is wrapping an ace bandage around her head. She says it helps putting consistent pressure on her head. I asked her why she doesn’t just use ibuprofen she said it doesn’t always work and they happen frequently enough she doesn’t want to over-use it, besides.

This doesn’t make sense to me. It doesn’t just stop working sometimes. I just think she doesn’t want to take it and is making up reasons.

The problem I have with it is the ace bandages make her look ridiculous. Like a mummy and her hair gets all crazy. Sometimes she wraps them around her eyes too so she just lays there looking dead.

So today when she started wrapping her head I told her it looks dumb and offered her an ibuprofen. She tried to tell me she didn’t want it, but I told her I was less attracted to her when she wrapped her head up. I said it nicely, but she looked hurt and took the bandages off. She took the ibuprofen and unwrapped her head and we continued watching tv. Even an hour later she was still wincing like she had a headache and eventually she just got up, took the bandage, and went to our room.  I asked what was up and she said she’d prefer to talk after her headache.

She’s making me feel guilty and like im TA but I was only being honest! I try to look nice for her, why wouldn’t she want to do that for me?

 

EDIT: Okay jesus guys, so I’m the asshole. I bet you’ll be happy to know that in our room she was apparently packing her clothes. She literally just broke up with me and left with the fucking ace bandage on her head. I feel like that’s an overreaction for a fight about a headache, but whatever. Deleting this account.",Asshole
AITA for expecting my daughter to watch a movie with the family even though she’s working?,"Ok hear me out. My daughter works online and makes her own schedule. Today I planned for the family to watch a movie together including my daughter (she’s here for the weekend). So I tell my her what I planned and she said she has to work since she didn’t get anything done this weekend so she’d like to get atleast a few hours in but would try to free some time if she can. I check back a little later but she is still working and I say we’re starting the movie in 10min and is she going to come or not? And she said sorry she’s pushing her deadlines and can’t just stop working for 3 days straight. I got annoyed by that and took her tablet computer and said if she doesn’t wanna spend time with the family then she should atleast go do something healthy for once (she spends hours upon hours on that thing). She got pissed and reluctantly went to the living room and watched it with us but didn’t seem happy about it at all. that Just crossed the line for me, it’s just rude and immature to be all pouty about it. So afterwards I said I’d give her computer back but I wouldn’t allowed her internet access for the remainder of her stay (I think this is reasonable as she is using the internet I am paying for). And she said fine but she still has work to do so she’s heading home early. I don’t see why she can’t just accommodate for her shedule it’s not like she has a boss to fire her but instead she has to be pouty and leave. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for asking my wife to move seats to be accommodating?,"My wife (21f) and I (27m) have gotten into this more than once. The first time we were picking up my dad from his house to go out for dinner. My wife and I were only dating at the time. As we approached his house I asked her to get out of the car and move to the back once we arrived. She acted shocked and disgusted that I would ask her to do this, saying she feels like I am prioritizing my father over her (which isn't true, I don't really like my dad, but he would be more comfortable in the front). She even cried a little which felt like such an overreaction. In the end, she got into the back of the car, and we enjoyed the rest of our evening though she was notably sullen. We never spoke about it again and a similar situation didn't happen for a while. 

Now married, the situation has happened once again. My long time friend moved in with us from across the country and all three of us were heading out to celebrate when I noticed her opening the door to the front passenger seat. I gently reminded her ""Don't you think you should be sitting in the back?"" She seemed shocked at my suggestion and even asked me if I was serious, and of course I was. She is on the shorter side and my friend is several inches taller than her so it makes sense for him to have more leg room, right? When I told her this she simply shut down and silently got into the back seat and stsrted texting on her phone. The rest of the evening she was withdrawn and barely spoke.

Once we were alone she insisted I let her sit in the front seat from now on in our car because it's a ""matter of respect"" and told me that all of her friends think its weird that I try to accomodate my friend instead of her. This is in violation of our agreement to never complain about eachother to our friends, but that aside I think it's kind of ridiculous to be so upset about where you sit in the car? She told me she was humiliated that I had ""put her in the back"" in front of my friend. I didn't think much of it at the time but now I'm wondering if maybe I am the asshole here.

tldr wife doesn't like when I ask her to give her front seat up to people who need it more.

edit: I guess I'm an asshole. For what it may be worth I did not push her into our marriage, if anything it was the other way around. She was 18 when we met so i didn't groom her. She has severe anxiety and is a lot to handle and I just wish she would appreciate all the good I do for her. I feed her, clothe her and put a roof over her head, but little stuff like this happens and she always starts saying it feels like I don't love her when that obviously isn't true considering how much money it costs to even have her in my life.

AITA for suggesting that my son leave his fiance who can't have kids,"A little background, I am a father to one son and one daughter. My daughter is mostly estranged from me as her and my wife do not get along. (Not my choice, they choose to avoid each other). I am very close with my son, and his step mother loves him as she has helped me raise him since he was 11. 

When my son turned 18 he joined the Air Force and was stationed on the other side of the country, and though we're still close it's definitely not as close as before especially with his new fiance in the picture. He's 26 now and just proposed to his girlfriend that we've met once last year. Initially I really liked her and was happy because she made my son happy but my wife absolutely despises her and if I'm going to be on either side it will be hers. 

On top of my wife not liking his new fiance, we learned that she has been very sick for the last few months and they were sent to the mayo clinic to help determine what was wrong with her. While they were there they found out that she shouldn't ever have children because supposedly if she did her and the baby wouldn't live. I don't know if this is true but I don't really care because I don't think my son should be forced to be with someone that he found out can't have children AFTER they were engaged. 

They're not married yet, and ya I get that she's sick but I want the best for my son, and I want him to be able to have a family some day. She can't do that for him, and I know he loves her but I think he'll regret not having his own biological children someday. Also we have generational names in my family, my father, myself and my son all have the same name. I want him to continue our legacy. 

I told my son that he should reconsider the relationship and he yelled at me telling me he loved her and would never leave her and then hung up and now won't answer my calls. I'm looking out for him. I just don't want him to have any regrets.

Edit: 

1. I still love my daughter and want a relationship with her but I can't force her to want a relationship with me. 

2. My wife doesn't like my son's fiance because of the way she acted when they visited, she was standoffish and distant. Also my wife was very very close to my son before he met this girl and then when they visited he spent almost all his time with her, that hurt my wife. 

3. They don't want to do a surrogacy because she has genetic issues which would just leave adoption and I think he'd regret not having a child of his own.",Asshole
Aita for telling my boyfriend that I'd call the cops after he didn't tip?,"Okay so for context I'm 17 and this happened before corona.

I was super butthurt that neither of them told me. Not even mad. So my bf took me to dinner as an apology (rhymes with molive barden). I felt bad that the poor waitress had to deal with us because I have specific diet restrictions and my order was a hassle. Not to mention my bf was kinda rude and snappy. We were paying for our own food and I tipped 40%. My bf didn't tip anything. I was kinda peeved. ""Do you need money for a tip?"" I asked and he snorted with a ""you don't need to tip them y'know"" he said it with the tone of ""you're an idiot"". I said that you didn't HAVE to. But if you're a descent human being you should. This set him off and he basically called me a fat sociopath (I'm 180?) And stormed out of the restaurant without paying. He was my ride. I payed for his food and left to walk home. Suddenly his car was behind me and he was begging for me to get in the car. I told him to kindly f*ck off. He continued to beg so I yelled if he didn't leave me alone I'm calling the cops. He called me a crazy whore and left. Wtf. The reason I remember this story is because I was talking to him and he was begging for nudes.

AITA for punishing my teenage daughter very harshly for catching her playing with a beer can?,"TL;DR Yesterday i caught my (44M) daughter (14F) in her room toying with an unopened low-alcohol beer can. I then grounded her for 3 months and took away her phone for a month. She got really upset. I might've been too harsh, but i think it was necessary.

Yesterday, when I (44M) came home from work, I went to say hi to my 14-year old daughter, who was in her room at the time. I knocked on her door and opened it, and she yelled something like ""No, don't come in!"". After opening her door, i saw her trying to panically hide something (which would very soon be confirmed a beer can) that she had in her hands. I recognized it as a beer can and immediately started yelling at her asking what the fuck she had in her hands, and she just hysterically repeated that she wasn't drinking it. I ripped the can from her hands, and to be fair, it was pretty low alcohol (2.7%) and unopened, but she still shouldn't have alcohol at that age. (Well, she wasn't drinking it, but she probably would've, had i not intervened.) 

I asked her where she'd gotten it and she told me (although a little incoherently due to her sobbing) that her friend had given it to her yesterday, when they went out for fast food. I then asked her how long she'd been drinking, and she told me that she doesn't drink. And i normally would believe her, since she doesn't go out that much and when she does, she comes home at a very reasonable time. But i had caught her with a beer can, so i still don't really believe her. I mean, nothing stops her from drinking during the day when she's out with her friends. She was still telling me how sorry she was and that she wasn't drinking and that she was just playing with the can, same old same old. I told her that i don't believe her and that i will not let my daughter become an ""alcoholic bitch."" (Perhaps my wording was too harsh, but sometimes you have to be harsh.) She was still trying to convince me that she wasn't drinking and she never would, but i'd already made up my mind: i took her phone, which was recharging on her nightstand and told her that i'm taking away her phone for a month and grounding her for three.

She was pretty devastated to say the least: she started crying uncontrollably, begging me and still trying to convince me that she didn't do anything wrong. I told her that my descision stands, and then came her petty insults and 'i-hate-yous'. I just told her that she gets what she deserves and went to my bedroom. We haven't spoken since.

Now, i'm thinking of shortening her sentence, because it was pretty harsh. But imo some form of punishment is absolutely necessary, i'll not let my daughter become like my old man, who was a depressed alcoholic.

The tawouk was for me but I noticed a white employee was preparing my plate. I've never seen him here before. Another employee was making my girlfriend's food so I asked if he could make mine, too.

The way I see it, if I'm getting food like this, a white guy isn't going to know how to make it. Some of it is prepared in advance, yes, but he's not going to know how to dress the plate, a good ratio of accoutrements, etc.

The white guy said ""really dude?"" and continued making my meal. The other employee said it was rude and just to let things happen. Whatever. When I got home, I gave my girlfriend my food and I just ate what I ordered for her.

First it was because I forgot to get anyone gifts. I am 14 and don’t work but he thinks I should have made something or used my allowance to buy other people stuff.

Then when it was the day after Christmas. I made my mum cry. It was an accident though. 

See I got up, opened a box of chocolates and started snacking. Seems innocent enough. 

Apparently the box was a gift to her. 
Apparently that was the only chocolate or candy she got off anyone. 
Apparently we have similar taste buds because I only left the ones she doesn’t like. 

I tried apologizing saying that I didn’t know the chocolates were hers but my family says I was right there when she opened them I passed over the gift to her to unwrap and the friends made a big deal about finding imported Chocolates from her childhood. 

She said she wasn’t mad and that she won’t be hurt and sad forever but my uncle keeps giving me a hard time. He keeps trying to convince her to go to a spa instead of buying me gifts next year which is unfair. I don’t think eating a few chocolates is SOOO bad I don’t deserve gifts.

However when we first started talking he would curse, which I didn't like at all. So I told him to stop and he said he'll try his best around me from then on. To be fair he has, however he would slip up and say a curse word every couple of months. I'd forgive him and we'd move on, however I recently just had a baby. My kid is now six months old, and ready for visitors, so of course I wanted my friend to come see my son.

As soon as he sees the baby he goes, ""aww he's so f---ing cute!"". This really annoyed me, as he was now cursing in front of my baby now. I told him to leave and he said, ""I just got here though? why?"" I told him it was his cursing habits and we started arguing. He said that he always moderates his use of language when he's with me cause he respects me, but he told me this is ridiculous and to not contact him unless its an apology. I feel like I was in the right but people are telling me I was the A-hole. I've only heard him curse like 10 times in my life.",Asshole
AITA because I told my stepdaughter she was a quitter,"She's 17, on her way to many scholarships in the medical field, into a ton of extracurriculars. She's been in varsity cheer since last year and tried out for the competition squad this year because it ""sounded fun"" and she placed as an alternate. Once she found out she was an alternate, she decided that her volunteer hours were more important because she isnt ""part of the team"" and was going to drop out. I told her that if her volunteer hours were more important, it should be the case whether she was an alternate or not and that she was quitting because she didn't get what she wanted and is using excuses. I told her it would reflect poorly on her and, had this been a job, she would not get a reference or be considered for rehire. She started crying, because...17yr olds.

AITA for telling my soon to be sis in law that I don't like our bridesmaid dress?,"Peraonally, I think the dress looks terrible, and she knows that I hate the color maroon but shes still trying to get me to pay $40 for an ugly dress I would only be in for a couple of hours. She is telling me that I'm being unreasonably insensitive because its my brothers wedding. AITA for this? I genuinely don't understand how I'm being unreasonable?

Edit: I'm not trying to make it about me. She asked for my opinon and I told her what I thought. Also, $40 spare is A LOT when I'm already working paycheck to paycheck and can barely afford to feed myself.

Edit#2: SIL accepted my choice not to be a bridesmaid, and even now after almost a year, we are still the best of friends and we are very close. So it worked out for both of us in the end because her own budget wouldn't accommodate 7 bridesmaids.",Asshole
AITA for not flushing the toilet late at night?,"So my parents (50s), brother (18), and sister (16), all go to bed between 11 PM and midnight, and wake up between 8 and 9 AM (sometimes my parents get up at 6 AM to walk dogs). 

I (21) go to bed between 3 and 4 AM and wake up between 1 and 2 PM. I eat a midnight snack, or even a 1 AM snack, and I drink a lot around then, so I always need to piss and crap at like 2 AM. I don't flush the toilet when I do this because I don't want to wake my family up with the flushing sound, but my mom gets pissed when she finds my logs in the bowl in the morning.

AITA for telling my girlfriend it was rude to fall asleep during dinner with my grandparents?,"My (24m) girlfriend (22) and I met 2 years ago in New Zealand (my country) when she was here on a uni trip. She's from England. We fell in love and have been long distance since with visits every 6 months. 

After many long discussions we finally decided that she should move to NZ. She arrived on Wednesday. On Thursday we were having tea with my grandparents who invited us to welcome her. After tea we stayed at the table and had a chat. It was maybe 7.30 so not late at all when she apparently got really tired. She asked me of we could go home since she wanted to sleep. I told her not yet because my grandmother had backed a cake and it would be rude to leave before she served it. About 10 minutes later she put her head on my shoulder and FELL ASLEEP!! I woke her up and told her that we could leave soon as my grandmother was just getting the cake ready. Then we ate the cake and my girlfriend half fell asleep again with her head against the wall this time. We left shortly after and I told her that it was rude to fall asleep and my grandparents were really looking forward to this night and had put a lot of effort into food and dessert. She started crying and said that she was still really jet lagged and maybe it was a mistake to move for me if I was going to be so mean. 

She has been crying on and off today but that's probably just because she's still settling in. 

I feel bad for making her cry but at the same time I feel like what she said was uncalled for.",Asshole
AITA for letting my son have a big mac instead of doing his extra-homework?,"I (m41) have a very overcontrolling and Bitchy wife (f39). She's from a rich family and thinks the world revoles around her.  We have a 12 year old son together, and he's very smart. 

Since he's not in school, he's been doing his homework at home. He does the homework very fast, so the material ran out fast. So his mothers been working him like a dog with extra work she's been making herself. He does about 2-5 a day, and she won't let him do anything else if he isn't done. 

About a week ago, she was away visiting her grandmother, and he was supposed to do a report on butterflies, among other things. He started crying because he was so stressed and i hugged him and told him he can go warm up a big mac i had in the fridge and watch cartoons while i did it for him. 

His mom came home and i told her he had done his homework /white lie/, and she said he could carry on the entire day outside. 

Later, when she examined the papers or his work (she does that every night), she noticed that the handwriting was like mine and asked me about it. I confessed what i did and she got mad i tried to tell her that she needs to stop treating a 12 year old like a office worker.

AITA for telling one of my cousin of age 20 who has gotten fat fast since we last met that she should get checked and reduce weight very bluntly?,"Well I am related to medical field and yesterday at a party I met one of my cousin who is around 20-21 years and I think I met her last 3 months ago.  I noticed she has gotten a lot plump so I asked her had she planned to get so much weight or was it not planned?  And then I immediately said,  if it is not planned,  get yourself checked for PCOD to a gynaecologist as you may not remain fertile.  You should lose weight.  I am used to being straightforward.  She immediately made the saddest face and said - 'Dude you are so insensitive. Why are you also saying about my weight?  I thought you would be sensitive person!'  And then she didn't talk for whole party.  Look I said all that because PCOD has a complication of infertility and one of the treatment options is to weight reduction....  So I just said it.
EDIT - ok.  This is having a little bit of misunderstanding.  I DID NOT say this. In front of everyone else.  I asked her to come sideways in a little privacy and then told her this.  I thought it would be obvious since you don't discuss this in open party.  But I guess I needed to clarify it.

AITA for completely ignoring a friend I once pursued,"There comes a time in a man's life, at least for those who are not good with girls, when one realizes something is seriously wrong with their dating game and they have to go fix it. After losing weight, reading fashion, psychology self-help, and *killing* neediness I was able to lift myself up... except all this happened because of a female friend who rejected my romantic advances (""eww no"" actually stings more than you think).

Fast forward to half a year later, I'm at this casual work conference. Lots of people shaking my hand, lots of compliments. Out of the blue, I hear her voice call my name... she has a hand raised rather enthusiastically to high-five as if we're close (we *were* close, in a sense, long ago when people teased we were a couple). 

And I just... 

I walk past her.

And it felt *soooooooooo* good. More than the sum total of girls I approached this year combined, the phone numbers, the rejections I braved to become a better man and learning how to move on. She was the epitome of the dating life I wanted to leave behind: nice guy texts she eventually stopped responding to, driving her around, having platonic lunch together. She was the final straw that cracked my nice-guy dating paradigm. It made sense to just fade away and have some self-respect... so greeting her a happy birthday (months ago) was the last thing I ever did before we just kinda stopped being friends.

I didn't even have a smug face on, I just took the coffee I ordered at the nearby stall and continued walking. Am I an asshole?",Asshole
AITA for being slightly racist?,"Alright so a little bit of backstory, I was talking to my friends about which type of girls we like and how some races are more attractive than others, we were speaking in the middle of class and we were in a class where we really dont do much so everyone was pretty much chilling. So we got to the topic of black people and one of my girl friends said she finds black guys really attractive and I said ''Forreal? I find black girls to be the most unnatractive out of all races''. At that point my teacher got up and started yelling at me saying ''you're really gonna say that?'' Do you realize what you're saying?''. To which i responded ''said what do you mean? Im just stating my own opinion about who im attracted to''. He then went on about me being racist and after class ended he kicked me out of the class while waiting for my friends and he confronted them and told them that they shouldnt be friends with a racist like that. I just laughed it off with my friends but it left me thinking, was i really being racist for stating my opinion on who im attracted to? So am i the asshole?

AITA for kicking out kid from McDonalds?,"Background: I am the manager of a Mcdonals that is near a soccer field.  It was around 7 and getting dark. My restaurant was not very busy. Most of the tables were open.  Threre is a no loitering sign on my door. A soccer game had ended nearby. This happened a few years ago.

Story: So a kid(M14) referee walks into my restruant. He sits down and pulls out his phone. He is dialing someone and talking to them. I give him a few minutes assuming he is going to order something soon. After that passes, I walk up to him and ask if he is going to buy anything. He responds with no. He starts to explain that everyone had left and he was starting to get scared in the dark. He explained that he does not have a data plan and has to use WhatsApp which requires wifi to make calls. Using my store wifi, he had made the call. His parents would be here in 20 minutes. After casually listening to his explanation, I asked him if he had seen the sign on my door. He said yes but he thought that I would understand. I told him he had to buy something or leave. He started to look for the money he had made  when he reffed but could not find it. This meant that he could not buy anything so I told him to leave. He looked like he was about to cry and left. I discussed this with my coworkers and they thought that I was being unkind. I told them that i was just following rules.

Edit: another thing was he was cussing very loud at his parents and essentially yelling at them for not picking him up sooner.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to pull forward at a drive through fast food window when nobody was behind me?,"I order and pay for my food like normal and after getting my drink someone sticks their head out of the window and says ""Would you please pull up and I'll bring your food out to you?""

I said ""There's no one behind me tho""

And the guy said, ""Yeah but I'm trying to get my times down and it's still running with you sitting here.""

And I said, ""Yeah see and I think it's important for the time to accurately reflect how fast you're delivering the food.""

Then he said, ""Sir....I've asked you nicely to please just pull up.""  

So I said, ""I understand that but I think it's important for the times to be accurate.""  

And he said, ""Oh the times are accurate. Would you just please pull up?""

And this went back and forth a few more times with no one pulling into the drive through behind me.

As soon as he shut the window - he turns around and grabs my food and starts filling up the bag.  Literally 30 seconds after he shuts the window they had me my food and I drive off.

AITA for having sex on a flight?,My girlfriend and i were pretty horny on our flight from our flight to Santorini and we went to the bathroom to have sex. We had a few drinks and the flight was only an hour and a half so its not like there was a problem and there were at least 4 bathrooms on the plane. Plus the flight was in the middle of the night so most people were sleeping.  We were in there for only around 8 minutes and as we left the bathroom there was some old lady (around 70 probably Italian) who was staring at us. She was around 10 aisles in front of us so there's no way she heard us i'm guessing she saw both of us go into the bathroom together and assumed what we were doing.  She goes off about how rude it is that we would do that on a flight and i apologize because i thought she needed to use the restroom but then i look back and i see that all the bathrooms are available so i explain all the bathrooms in the back are available there was no reason for her to be upset. She goes on about how it's immoral for us to be having sex an stuff and we tell her its out bodies and we can do what we want.

AITA that I expect more from my baby's godmother?,"Hey there, I'm having a bit of a moral dilemma and I was hoping you all could help me out. 

Short version: My BF's sister hasn't bought or done anything for our new baby, despite being ons of her Godmothers. 

Background: My BF(34M) and I (29F) gave birth to a sweet baby girl at the beginning of July. Because we both have a sister, we decided to make both our sisters Godparents of our little one. We asked them both on Easter and they both were extremely happy. My SIL already has 2 children of her own, 2 boys, and is financially stressed atm. My sister has a steady job, owns her own house and recently got engaged to her BF of 7 years.

The main problem I am having right now is the differences between them, both in money and time spend with us and our little girl. Since her birth, my sister has called me several times, came to visit with us (despite living an hour away), bought several things from our baby list... in short, she has taken the time and effort to be around. 

Since birth we have seen my SIL once, when our little one was 6 days old. She didn't bring anything along, nor tried to get together or get in touch with us to meet up and see her Godchild. My BF tells me not to worry, their family never were very close to start with, but I'm a bit annoyed. I don't want her to spend a ton of money, or come by every day, however just a simple phone call or arranging a bit of time with our little one seems like the bare minimum. I'm not sure what to do, last time I spoke to her about an annoyance of mine, she basically tried to shift the blame away and we haven't spoken since. I haven't reached out to her either, because I feel it should now come from her. I personally regret making her Godmother, so I don't feel like sending her updates and pictures on a regular base, like I do with my sister. 

AITA for expecting more from her as the Godmother of my child? She told me when I was pregnant she couldn't do much financially, but she would give our little one a lot of love. Sadly I haven't noticed that love so far. So people, IATA in this?

Edit: After reading some of your comments, I decided to ask my BF how his relationship with his own godparents was and I learned some big differences. I will try to give her a bit more time before judging her too harshly. For all the people who think this is about money, it's not. Nor is it about gifts or anything materialistic. I grew up being very close to both my godparents and I want my little girl to have a similar relationship of trust and love with hers. My godmother didn't have much money either, but she did try to spend time with me and be a trustee during my teen years. I will take all your comments to heart and try not to compare them too much anymore. Thank you for all the replies.",Asshole
AITA For Telling Son Not to Tell GF He Loves Her,"My son is 16. He was facetiming his girlfriend of 10 months in the living room. I'm his mom and walked by him. I heard him tell his gf I love you and heard her say it back.


Later I told him he shouldn't say that to her. He is too young to be moving that fast, and too young to love someone romantically. He shouldn't try to pretend to be an adult in an adult relationship. This could point to him trying to rush into things like sex and marriage too quickly. Them getting too invested like this can also make the hurt feelings worse when they inevitably break up.


My son argued and said he does love her and will continue telling her. I told him she doesn't love him. She's just too young to feel that way. He got really upset saying I'm so ""negative"" and ""unsupporting"" of him. He went to his room and is being cold.",Asshole
AITA for being disappointed about my birthday?," So this happened a couple months ago and I’m still thinking about it. I haven’t actually talked to anyone about it but I’m just wondering if my feelings are justified or not. 

So this summer i decided to plan I trip to Europe for my family. I found the tickets and made the plan almost entirely on my own, but it was a trip with everyone in our family. I was 17 at the time and it would’ve been paid for by my parents. I was also planning on meeting a friend there (she paid for herself), so the trip was late July - mid August. 

My birthday is late July, and initially it would’ve ended up being a few day before we were set to leave. However, last minutes the airline called and we had to rebook to tickets to leave on my birthday. 

This brings up another problem. For the last 2 birthdays I’ve had, I haven’t gotten a different presents from everyone in family. I don’t have a problem with this, it just the way it’s presented makes me kinda upset. For example, last year I went to Costco with my mom, not even on the day of my birthday, she bought me a vitamix, and offhandedly said “oh this is your present this year btw”. I loved the gift but I wish it was presented more as a gift I guess. 

Now this year, it was my 18th birthday. My mom once again offhandedly joked a couple days before we left on the trip that the trip was going to be my present. I was kinda peeved again but I didn’t want to complain because this a pretty big trip. To make things worse, on the actual day of my birth we were at the airport running around. I got a couple happy birthdays, but no cake or special dinner or whatever. It made my 18th birthday feel like an afterthought. 

I know that this isn’t 100% the fault of my family because they couldn’t control the airline dates, but I wish they tried a little harder to make me feel special. 

I don’t know if I’m just being entitled and bratty or if my disappointment is justified. It’s not that I want to be showered with presents or anything but idk it just feels shitty somehow.

AITA For being upset that my gf drank without me on her 21st?,"AITA for being mildly upset at my friend for giving my gf drinks on her 21st when I wasn't around. I mean I was mildly uncomfortable when she told me, but I didn't really show it because I don't like being possessive or anything. When I asked her how she got it, she told me that my friend asked her if she wanted a shot of rum, and she said no, then he insisted because it was her birthday. She told me she felt forced and uncomfortable and drank it to shut him up.

Am I the asshole for confronting my friend the next time I saw him and asking him not to give my gf drinks when I'm not around, especially if she already said no.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Alright so let me answer some common questions.

\-It was her first drink ever, and she and I had planned on drinking together after our classes were done for the day.

\-This was during the day, I was in class while this happened, that's why I wasn't there.

\-He pushed it on her in public, not private, it was where my friend group usually hangs out during the day.

\-She told me through text after it happened, so there wasn't really any way for her to see my reaction, and it wasn't like she went to a bar or something.

\-The friend who peer pressured her into taking the shot is an alcoholic.

EDIT 2: I have no issue with her drinking without me, I was upset at my friend for pushing the drink on her. At no point did I blow up on anyone, I just asked him not to push drinks on her again.",Asshole

AITA for not wanting my daughter's stepmom to be playing mommy with my kid?,"AITA...my daughter's father is remarried and her stepmom and her family involve my daughter in their lives a lot. They are nice people but they have my daughter call them grandpa, aunt, cousin, etc and get upset if they hear that I prefer my daughter call them by their names and not family titles. Her stepmom, or so I heard, was not too happy that I told my daughter to address her as her stepmom and not mom. Today I found out her stepmom took her to be in their holiday family portrait, and my daughter's father wasn't included. So they had their family portrait with my daughter in it. Her father thinks I'm jealous and frequently says that they ARE her family. I feel it's a bit of an attempt to invalidate me and just a little strange. Who has someone else's kid in their family holiday picture? Are they planning to send this out to others I don't know as holiday cards?

AITA for telling me sister IDGAF about what’s happening overseas when she was talking about the Hong Kong protests at her birthday?,"My sister is a very outspoken and intelligent person. She loves nothing more than a good discussion and at family get togethers she’ll frequently turn the conversation political or control the conversation to either make others feel bad (eg. Calling out republican voting family etc) or to try and ‘educate’ people into supporting her flavor of wokeness. 

It was her birthday party last night and my mom threw a small party to celebrate. She invited family over and we just had close fam there. 

My sister at dinner that my mom had spent hours preparing decided to leap into conversation about what’s happening to Muslims in China and Burma, and also the protests in south east Asia (Hong Kong maybe?) she directed this conversation to the table at large and really went in on how we are just passive bystanders, how children are dying, etc. And went into detail about suffering that people are facing. 

The whole time she was saying this she was directly staring at me because I frequently tell her that it’s not a conversation I want to hear, my mental health isn’t great tbh and I’m already brain deep in miserable thoughts. I know we can’t control the shit happening outside the world but I’m seriously burned out from all the shit going on and I don’t think it’s appropriate to ALWAYS be angrily doom and gloom. 

When other family members began to slowly stop eating, shift and look uncomfortable, she carried on. Finally my uncle told her to leave off and my mom asked her to just enjoy dinner. She carried on. 

Eventually I just blew up and told her no one gives a shit about what’s going on outside the world, half of us are fucking stressed about what’s happening in the US for crying out loud and compassion fatigue is a real thing. 

She responded by literally screeching that I’ve ruined her birthday, that I’m a heartless ass, etc. I feel very very guilty, moreso because my uncle slipped me $20 to buy myself some beer when the night was done and he and her have famously never got along so I feel bad that he took enjoyment from it.",Asshole
WIBTAH if i dated 2 guys at the same time?,"Throw away account. I (28F) have been (casually) seeing this guy (32M) for about 3 months, Let’s call him Matt. I have started to catch real feelings for him, however I will say that he has some baggage, I won’t get into the specifics, but for the past month or so I feel like he’s been particularly distant and just blames it on being busy with work/travel or feeling depressed and not feeling up to it when we try to make plans to hang out. He has also stated previously that he is not ready to be in a serious relationship right now with everything he has going on, but that he would like to continue to see me and thinks he could be ready at some point, just not right now. I respected that and agreed to continue feeling things out until if/when we are both ready to take the next step. We have never made things exclusive, but I’m not the type of person to date multiple people, especially if I have strong feelings for someone. 

A good friend of mine recently told me that one of her guy friends (30M) has expressed some interest in getting to know me better, so she asked if it was okay if she gave him my number, to which I agreed that she could. This other guy, let’s call him Tom, and I have met on several occasions in social settings, so it’s not really a blind date or set-up type of situation, but since we have been texting (we haven’t gone out 1-on-1 yet) I haven’t let on that I’m seeing someone else. I’ll be completely honest Tom is not my usual type, he’s not bad looking or anything, but just not what I typically find myself attracted to and I think part of the reason is that I’m very attracted to Matt, and I feel a lot of chemistry with him whereas I don’t so much with Tom, but he is a very sweet guy and seems like he would be a good match for me in a lot of other ways so part of me wants to get to know him better and see if I could possibly get over my compulsive attraction to men who are emotionally unavailable and afraid of commitment, and actually be in a real relationship with someone who seems to be genuinely interested in pursuing one. I feel like I’m not ready to end things with Matt, but I’m also willing to give Tom a chance to win over my heart. WIBTAH if I keep dating both men without them knowing about each other?",Asshole
"AITA for how I spoke to the woman who we traded seats with on a long flight, so me and my wife could sit together?","So, me and my wife just flew across the US after a New Years' vacation. We tried to check in to our flight as early as possible, but missed our alarm while on a subway train, and 15 minutes after we were allowed to check in, there were no more seats on the airplane next to each other. There were only two seats in the same row, one window seat and one aisle seat.

I figured it would be fine, since almost everyone prefers an aisle seat to a middle seat, and nobody likes being talked past by strangers on a flight, so we should have no problem asking the person stuck between us to switch to the aisle so that we could sit together. We were also downright exhausted after the trip so we'd planned on one of us being able to sleep a little bit by leaning against the side of the plane.

We board the plane and get to our row, and there's a woman sitting in the middle seat already.

She looks pissed that she has to get up to let one of us past, and while she's preparing to get up, my wife says ""actually we were wondering if you'd be okay maybe taking the aisle seat instead of the middle so that we could sit together?""

She looks taken aback, pauses for a second, and then says ""I'll take the window seat.""

My wife says ""We were hoping for the window seat, is it okay if you take the aisle instead?""

She says ""No, I'd prefer the window seat.""

At this point the stress of dealing with all the travel probably got to me and I said, pretty curtly, ""well, would you rather sit between us for the whole flight instead?""

Equally curtly, she says ""sure, if that's what you want.""

I decided not to push it any further and said ""fine, take the window seat.""

(I know these sentences might not seem rude on their own but both me and the woman we were talking to were definitely talking in a stressed tone that indicated displeasure.)

She just sits in her middle seat looking at me for a few seconds and then says ""so are you making me get up or what?""

I said ""you can have the window seat, that's fine.""

So she shakes her head and scoffs and gets up and sits in the window seat, taking her sweet time about it.

She then shuts both of the blinds on the airplane windows in our row and makes like she's going to sleep. This plane has a dimmer for the windows, so she could've put it very dim but where we could still see out a little, but opted instead to set both windows to fully blacked out.

I know I have no right to expect someone to voluntarily exchange seats on our behalf when we don't have it reserved. But I also feel like most people sitting in a middle seat would rather take either the window or the aisle. She still did us a favor, but being able to switch to the aisle is also a perk so accepting that trade still a nice way to meet someone in the middle (no pun intended). I also feel like there might have been an element of vindictiveness in fully dimming both windows without asking us.

AITA for telling a Chinese-American she doesn't look American?,"Throwaway because this happened with a coworker.

She got really huffy and asked what I meant and I told her she could pass off as Chinese (she even speaks it!) whereas I don't look anything but American and I'd be scared for my life if I went. She then got even more pissed off and told me I don't get to dictate who looks American and who doesn't.

I still don't think I did anything wrong, I wasn't calling her non-American but just that when someone looks at her they might not automatically assume she's American whereas it's way more obvious that I am. AITA?

AITA for replacing my stepdad with my bio dad as the person to walk me down the aisle?,"So I'm prepared to be called an asshole for this, as everyone else in my life has already, but still curious to see the responses. Gonna try to be as unbiased as possible. 

&#x200B;

My fiance and I are getting married this fall. Earlier this year (like in Feb) I reconnected with my bio dad after not seeing him for roughly 5 years. He ran off with some other woman and left my mother and I when I was only 5, and then was intermittently in our lives until I turned 21 and he just disappeared altogether. He never paid support so my mom and I were broke and at one point homeless (couch surfing) until she married my stepdad and we finally had a stable home.

&#x200B;

Anyways I know that my bio dad isn't a perfect guy. My mom absolutely hates him and wants nothing to do with him, but tolerates him slightly for my benefit. I also have a stepdad who's been in my life since I was 7. He's a truly amazing guy who's great to my mom and has singlehandedly supported me through college and now med school. I do see him as my ""dad"" although there has always been a place in my heart reserved for my bio dad, even though I can't explain why.

&#x200B;

Now that wedding preparations are in full swing I recently decided that I want my bio dad to walk me down the aisle. This was already promised to my stepdad last year when I got engaged, but no one could've predicted my bio dad coming back to us. He's a completely different person from what my mom knew of him and he has a loving family now (wife and baby) and just seems like a totally new man. We've reconnected and spent basically every weekend together since then and I just feel really ""whole"" in a way I never have before. I call him ""dad"" now as well and have started calling my stepdad by his first name (which isn't that big of a deal tbh since I've done it now and then ever since I left for college).

&#x200B;

Well, my mom and some of our relatives have found out and they act like I'm committing genocide basically. They are MAD. My mom is telling me to think over my choices very carefully and if I really wanted to torpedo my relationship with my stepdad like this. Except I honestly don't think he would mind this much. If he really loves me and wants the best for me, why wouldn't he want me to reconnect with my real dad? It's not like I'd cut my stepdad out of my life, but it's just really important for me right now to have my dad by my side.

AITA? I have heard very polarizing opinions. My fiance is the only one who thinks I should do what I want since I'm the one getting married. But all my relatives and even my MOH thinks this is the wrong choice.",Asshole
AITA for telling a woman her bikinis were too revealing?,"My family (me, wife, two sons 16 and 13) recently went on a cruise. This is a higher-end line marketed toward families. We paid more to escape the college crowd that some lines draw.

One young woman (F, 20s) was on the pool deck everyday in bright colored revealing bikinis, tanning herself and drinking. By revealing I mean the smallest bikinis that would cover her breasts and bottom. They left nothing up to the imagination. She would also untie her bikini straps to show her back if she was laying on her stomach.

My wife and I noticed our sons would move around to get better views of her. If she went in the pool, so did they. If she was eating outside, they wanted to eat outside. My wife thought it was funny but I thought it was inappropriate. 

I did ask my sons FIRST to spend time with their family instead of staring at a stranger but of course they denied it and kept gawking. I then approached the woman myself and gently let her know that this is a family friendly cruiseline and modesty would be appreciated. She looked confused so I said ""Your bikinis are too revealing and it's disturbing other passengers"" and I walked away before an argument could ensue.

AITA for telling her this? My wife says I was an A and I should have left it alone. I think I was right to tell her this because it was a cruise with lots of families and revealing bikinis would be more appropriate for a different vacation. Also she covered up more after that so she probably realized my point.",Asshole
AITA for telling my wife I’m worried about her health?,"Using a throwaway because my wife knows my public.

First off, I love my wife. We’ve been married for a little over 18 months now and things couldn’t be better. However, she just left the house to go stay with her sister over a conversation and she says I’m in the wrong. So, into the story.

My wife loves mashed potato with butter. I work nights,  so she makes dinner for herself most of the time. Every night that she cooks for herself she’ll have a whole potato with whatever protein and greens, usually zucchini. 

She isn’t overweight or obese, but before we met she was. She loves her body now and of course I do to. But I’m really worried that this is could cause her to slip back on all the great work she’s done, and frankly I don’t know if a whole potato a day is good for her health. We both have today off (I have tonight off work) so I tried to bring this up with her gently, and suggested maybe taking a week off the potato and seeing how she feels. I also said I could bulk cook some meals on the weekend for her so she wouldn’t have to fall back on starchy white potatoes.

She was really upset and kept asking me if I was saying she was getting fat - I told her that I loved her and was just worried for her health in the future. We didn’t really fight about it, but she decided to stay at her sisters tonight, which means I won’t see her until after I finish my shift tomorrow night at the least. 

Should I have just kept my mouth shut?

AITa for thinking/mentioning under arm hair on my daughter-in-law law is gross and disgusting?,"My family gathers together each year for a family Christmas week. It’s a large enough house, but as you can imagine, it gets quite hot inside with so many people in there. Last night was one of the party nights, and it got very hot in the house again. My daughter in law is usually a very nicely kempt woman who dresses well and has nice makeup, perfume, all that good stuff, so I was a little surprised when she took her long sleeved cover off and there was visible unkempt underarm hair with her wearing a short sleeved shirt. It didn’t smell but did look so gross and I wasn’t expecting it on a well groomed woman like her. So I guess I gave an expression that was funny when I saw it, and later that night she heard me and some others talking about how disgusting she is. She was so upset she left the party with my son who’s now furious and demanding I apologize to her or they’re not coming back. Am I the asshole here in this situation?

AITA for giving away my sister’s cat?,"So my sister(27) has ovarian cancer and despite being told she would make it she’s still really sick and in the hospital all the time. My brother in law (35) has taken a lot of time off of work to stay by her side as well as other relatives and friends. Meanwhile I got saddled with taking care of Bunny, her 5 year old Maine Coon cat who my brother in law adopted and gifted to my sister. It’s been fine but I have my own problems and inner turmoil, a girl that I was interested in recently told me off saying I was a “creepy freak”, the girl’s girlfriend(who I had no idea about) posted some rude things on Facebook about me and people at my job seem to dislike me. Anyway due to my sister being sick I’ve had Bunny for the past three months and was overwhelmed so I posted an ad on Craigslist saying I was looking to rehome a cat I couldn’t take care of. A few days later I get a call from a guy who said he’s interested and gave Bunny away the following day. A week goes by before shit hits the fan, the guy was at the local pet store talking about his new cat and her adorable she was and he showed the cashier her picture. Cashier immediately says that she recognizes the cat as Bunny and gets sad and asks if her owner died and he says no. So the cashier asks how he come to have Bunny again and he says that I sold her and that I didn’t seem sick, cashier freaks out and tells him that the owner(my sister) is in the hospital with cancer and the guy freaks out as well. Cashier calls mutual friend who calls brother in law. Spent much of Sunday being called every name under the sun by him, other relatives said the same, friends are calling me a heartless bitch and my sister vehemently refuses to speak to me now. The guy I gave Bunny to called my sister and her husband to apologize saying he didn’t know he bought a “stolen” cat. 

I minced some details because my sister is sick and I couldn’t take care of her cat anymore and was trying to do a good thing here. Am I really the asshole here? No one wants to hear my side of things.

Edit: Look I’ve been going through some shit and didn’t have time to take care of a damn cat. I could’ve dumped her at the shelter but I didn’t, I found her a home but that didn’t work either. And if my sister dies then what? Will I still be the asshole for trying to find her cat a home?",Asshole
AITA for buying my kids snacks with my boyfriend's credit card?,"This morning, i had an errand to run. When i told my boyfriend where i was going, he asked if it was the place by the grocery store. He gave me his debit card and to get some turkey breast lunch meat (the only think he really eats anymore) and some other things. My son (7)overheard and asked if he could come, so did my daughter (8). My son asked if he could get some potato chips. My boyfriend just shrugged and said “sure, why not.”. My daughter asked if she could get a snack too and he agreed.

Now, after the first errand, they started to get bored and when i got them to the store, they were going crazy. They were putting stuff like cookies and snack cakes in my buggy. I tried telling them no, but they didn’t listen. We got to the potato chip aisle and my son just started picking up and picking up all kinds of different bags.

Plus they started arguing in the store about who would get to eat one of the things they got. She tried snatching it from my son’s hands, she almost knocked me over, they kept running off. Keep in mind, I didn’t have a list or anything, so I forgot.  Plus, they were so bad that i just wanted to get out of the store, so I paid for my stuff and we got in the car.

Halfway back to the house, it hit me that i forgot the turkey. I had to deal with 2 screaming kids shouting “Shut up, Dummy” back and forth. So i just said forget it and went home. As we’re loading the groceries in the house, my kids and i, he comes out and he doesn’t lift a finger to help carry in. He just asked why there are so many bags. I just explained that i got them some snacks for school, he just sighed. When we finally got everything in, he doesn’t help put stuff up either.

Instead, he starts pawing through the bags for his turkey. He asked where it was and i explained. He just shouted “What?!” and started complaining, then he found the receipt and had a meltdown about it “35 Dollars on junk food?! What the hell were you thinking?”. I told him he said they could get something. 

“I thought you were just gonna get one bag of potato chips. Not all this junk. I can’t afford this!” Then he threw his diabetes in my face again, as if i don’t hear that enough. “What the hell am I supposed to eat now?”  I told him i got a frozen pizza, it wouldn’t kill him to eat one piece. 

Then i brought up how he wastes money on cartoon dvd’s and netflix and streaming subscription, but i don’t want to let my kids starve and i’m the bad guy?. He just demanded his card back and stormed off into his office.",Asshole
AITA for not caring about spreading the flu?,"I had to take my mom to the hospital because she was having trouble breathing and turns out she had the flu. I was visiting her and a nurse came in with a mask on and asked me if anyone had talked to me about putting one on. I told him that I’m fine I have already had the flu this year. He said it’s more for seniors and kids who are more vulnerable to it. I told him that I wasn’t putting a mask on and he can’t legally make me wear one, and he got an angry look on his face and left.

I’ve already had the flu this year so I don’t even see how I could spread it to someone else if I don’t make physical contact with someone who has it. I shouldn’t have to worry about other people catching it, it’s not my concern or my responsibility. If you get the flu, drink plenty of fluids, get rest, and if it gets worse go to the doctor. It is not my problem if you cannot take care of yourself.

I’ll concede I was probably an asshole for how I talked to the nurse, but I don’t like it when people imply or tell me I need to do something that I’m not legally obligated to do.

I realized that if her parents couldn’t give her the wake up call then it’s my duty as her friend to do so. I told her that this useless degree will not get her anywhere and if she isn’t smart enough to major in a STEM degree she can at least come to business with me. An art degree will get her nowhere and honestly it’s better if she just doesn’t do college at all then do this shit. She told me to mind my own business and I told her not to worry because I am going to do that once I take over my fathers company. I also told her that this degree will not make her a future Beyonce. All it’s going to do for her is make her flip burgers at Wendy’s. This upset her so much that she literally blocked me and now isn’t talking to me. I’m just trying to help her not end up unemployed. I told my classmate about it and they are all laughing at her for the stupid major she wants to pursue. EVERYONE agrees with me that what she is doing is UNREASONABLE.

AITA for adopting a Pitbull when my boyfriend told me I couldn’t?,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years. And a few months ago we moved in together! I’m finally at a point in my life where I feel completely financially stable so I knew I could carry my own weight with paying rent and bills. 

And realizing I’m now financially stable I realized I’m also stable enough to finally get and afford my own dog. Before moving in I asked him if I could and he agreed. 

We also talked to his/(mine now) leasing office and they said they didn’t have weight or breed restrictions. I could afford the pet deposit and pet rent as well and got really excited.

My boyfriend and I talked further about it and he wanted to buy a certain breed of dog. I told him that I’ve always wanted to rescue though. He was pretty disappointed by this and told me he would prefer if it was just my dog if I adopted. Of course I understood and agreed. 

Last night I told him that I would be going today to adopt a dog and he said “ok, just please don’t get a pit bull.” I was pretty surprised he would say that and asked him why. He then listed off all the typical, awful and untrue stereotypes about pit bulls. 

I tried to convince him otherwise they are great dogs but he wasn’t having it and said again to please don’t get a pit. I gave up and told him I wouldn’t.

Today when I went to the shelter with my friends i looked and met a lot of dogs. Most were in fact pit bulls and I loved all of them. But one pit mix in particular really stole my heart. 

I ended up falling in love with the dog and actually crying because my BF told me I couldn’t get him. My friends immediately started trying to convince me to ignore him and get the dog. 

After a while at the shelter I ended up deciding to get the dog and bring him home and just let my bf meet him when he gets home.

She decided that she would paint the basement so that it is ready to be sold in five years. She also wants us to help paint it for free. I said I would like payment, but she disagrees heavily.

So my mom's argument is that things like painting yardwork, and general maintenance are all part of the responsibilities of being in this family. I disagree strongly.

He freaked out and said that was wrong.  I firmly told him that he should have included it in the roommate agreement and it wasn't my problem.  He got the RA involved and threw a fuss.

My husband (43M) has had issues in the past where he was feeling tempted by an assistant of mine and we had to let her go. 

The assistant was 26 at the time, and for a long time after, I’ve only hired household employees who were older women and had their own families.

I really took a chance by hiring a 21 year old college girl, and she’s been doing great at her job. But I told her when she started that I would feel more respected if she kept her clothing choices conservative. 

And until today, she’s done that. I understand the weather was in the 80s, but as I said earlier she had managed to make it work, in comfort at higher temperatures.

AITA for trying to force my fiance into getting a 4th pet?,"Warning: on mobile

So my fiance and I have been together for 6 years and have lived together for 5 of them. We adopted our first dog, a 10 week old shih tzu mix, from a local rescue group his BIL had connections with. Our dog is now 2 years old and I really wanted a second dog so we bought our first home and soon after, rescued our second dog, an 8 year old lab/pit mix. Despite the size difference, they always got along great.

3 months ago, our local AC shelter posted a video saying they were overrun with cats (mostly kittens from the pregnant moms they got in) and really needed more adopters. I begged and begged and begged some more, and he caved and agreed we could adopt a cat. We discussed and planned ahead of time that because of our dogs' personalities, a kitten would be better. I explained to him how most rescue groups say it's better to adopt 2 kittens at a time for socialization purposes and he grumbled but agreed. 

So we go to the shelter and find our 3 month bundle of fur. She grabbed my finger and wouldn't let go, and I knew she was the one. My fiance also got attached to her pretty quickly so we filled out the paperwork to bring her home. The problem is, our shelter is not a rescue group and would only allow us to adopt one. So I went back to looking at possible second cats. He told me to wait until ours adjusted so I agreed. 

Since the second we brought her home, she loves our dogs and they love her. They are the perfect little pack. Well then we discovered she had ringworm so we had to push looking for a second cat back even more. So then a month had passed.. then another.. I had found an adorable black cat online from a different rescue group and wanted to adopt her. We argued, he said we couldn't afford it, I said we could and that he agreed. He said to give him time. Well too much time passed, and she got adopted. I recently found another kitten and have been pushing for him to go see her during their adoption event next week since I would be at work and he won't be. He's adamantly against it, even though he agreed to a second cat in the first place. ""Well then why didn't we get two?"" He argued.

""Because the shelter wouldn't let us and you know that."" 

Here's where I might have been slightly an asshole. We're renting one of our bedrooms to our friend and I asked him about it since he owned cats before. He did agree that having 2 cats is better but said we shouldn't get one if we both don't agree. My fiance got annoyed that I involved him and is still refusing to even go look at the cat. 

So AITA?

TL;DR: I want a cat and was promised two cats. Fiance does not want a second cat. I involved roommate with cat experience. He's annoyed.

Edit: I can already see I'm voted YTA. The problem was never too many animals, he knew when he proposed that I wanted a full furry house, just too many animals too fast when my fiance thinks we should be saving money for our first vacation in a long time planned early next year and then our wedding. We agreed to revisit the subject after our vacation and reassess our situation then. So no second cat for now. He pointed out how much our shih tzu acts like a cat anyway.",Asshole
"AITA for chugging milk before going to bed, although I am lactose intolerant?","Throwaway because milk. So my boyfriend and I were about to go to bed together (not in a sexual way or anything silly like that), but I had pure insomnia before going to bed. So, my boyfriend suggests drinking milk before going to bed. I refuse and tell him that I am lactose intolerant. He pinkie-promises me that he would not judge me if I fart in bed or anything like that. I accept and chug the milk, because not only was I really thirsty, but I also was tired and couldn't think straight. So, we go to bed, and about half an hour in I get awaken by my boyfriend, and he tells me to move because I keep ""stinking up the bed"" and he ""doesn't want to hear farts"". He also tells me to check my pants for any crap, because he genuinely believed that I soiled myself. He ended up kicking me to the couch, even though he made me a promise. I'm heartbroken, and I apologized to him in the morning. He got over it pretty quickly, but I still feel like crap.

AITA for refusing to go to SIL’s wedding on fathers’ day?,"I just found out my wife’s stepsister’s wedding is being held on fathers’ day. I said that is ridiculous and said I won’t go. Because I’m not a complete ass I asked why they would do that. Well, her stepsister’s father passed so she wanted to celebrate on fathers’ day. I think that’s selfish of her to expect other dads to spend their fathers’ day attending her wedding. Be straight with me - AITA?


Edit: Ok, ITA. Thanks to everyone who judged my decision and not me as a person. A lot of great points. I figured my judgment was clouded based on undisclosed situational details. I still think weddings should be on Saturdays and not holidays but I’m happy for the couple and should celebrate on their terms.",Asshole
AITA for using language practice as an excuse to chat up girls I don't know?,"Changed a few details but I think the gist stays the same

I recently met up with a female friend. We also talked about dating and she mentioned how she'd been using Tinder and that she found it was easy to get matches but actually finding a good partner on it so far proved to be difficult. She then wanted to know what my experience with it was and I told her I didn't really use it. So what did I do then to meet girls, she asked.

I mentioned a few things and I also said that I'd started to talk to attractive Asian girls (since I have a bit of a thing for them anyway), who I presumed were Chinese (somewhat of a decent number in the city we're at), also asking if they spoke Chinese and then mentioning that I'd learned the language for a almost three years in college (I did) but that it was difficult to get actual practice now since I didn't really know many Chinese people. And later I'd ask if I could add her on WhatsApp since even writing with someone could be useful. After writing a bit some time later I might ask her if she'd sometime like to get coffee together, and so on.

This actually doesn't work that badly, only issue is that it doesn't work with Korean women, and you actually have to speak the language. But it's better than just talking to them for no reason, way better success rate. 

However my friend didn't seem to like my approach much. She argued it was insincere of me to claim it was for getting language practise when I was just trying to get with them. I tried to explain to her how being too direct wouldn't be good and that I of course also saw the additional practice as beneficial for myself but she argued that I should rather be honest and that if I was actually interested in the language I would also talk to Chinese guys or Asian girls who I didn't think were hot.

WIBTA if I vetted/interrogated current love interest about earning potential / monetary motivations?,"In every relationship that I've been in or even dates, I always want to vet/interrogate (Idk what the difference really is) to make sure they're not interested in me because they think I have a high earning potential. I'm a 5th year PhD student, and anticipate to graduate. I make barely above minimum wage right now as a student. I mention to my dates that I'll be pursuing a career likely in the financial industry as a quantitative researcher or in the tech industry, which can be quite lucrative. 

&#x200B;

I would never want to date someone who is interested in me because they think I will make a lot of money, even if they were genuinely interested in me for other reasons. I just wouldn't be at peace knowing that. I also want to mention that I distinguish between someone who is interested in me because of financial stability vs. someone who is interested in me because I make a lot of money. The former is desirable, but the latter is not. 

&#x200B;

I'm feeling the urge to ask my current love interest this question, but I feel like I'll be an asshole if I ask. I did ask her if she'd date a poor person, and she said ""yes, if I vibe with them. If I can have fun with them and I like their personality."" I personally might not be able to date a poor person because I don't like footing all the bills. And then today I asked her ""Would you be interested in me if I worked at Mcdonalds?"" She kind of chuckled and said ""no."" I'm not sure what she's trying to say because it seems that (1) She wouldn't date a poor person contrary to her original statement (2) She doesn't think my personality offsets my hypothetical lack of earning potential (3) Something else

&#x200B;

She's used to living a privileged life. It seems her parents provided that for her growing up. All of her LTR exes provided that for her as well, so that's what originally inspired my ""would you date a poor person"" question. I was concerned that she might be entitled (she said her last ex called her entitled), which is a huge turn off for me. But the rest of her personality does not appear to be aligned with entitlement. Furthermore, she's also spent substantial amount ($300+ occasionally) of money on me to go on dates, so I don't think she is entitled for now.  

&#x200B;

WITBA if I started to ask a bunch of questions to better understand her motive in regards to this? WITBA, in general, if I did this with all future love interests? I suspect Whether or not I'm TA may depend on how I ask the questions. 

&#x200B;

I do feel like it's an asshole-ish line of questioning. I think it will be very unlikely that I'll end up dirt poor, so I feel like me asking this question is almost just me looking for something to harp on, but at the same time, I also don't want to date people who are interested in me because of earning potential.",Asshole

WIBTA if I asked fast food employees to make my meals “fresh”?,"I’m on mobile so sorry if there are any issue because of that.

Basically I don’t eat fast food often but when I do, it can really be a hit or miss. As an example, i’m a big fan of fast food chicken nuggets and sometimes they’re juicy and delicious and other times their chewy and bland. I was wondering if it would be rude to ask for the employees to make my food “fresh.”

I don’t work with food but I work in customer service and I know there are certain requests from customers that are a real pain and/or I have no control over. I would hate to be “that customer” so I figured I’d ask.

Edit: Ok I think the general consensus is that I would not be the asshole AS LONG as I do it politely and I do not do it in the drive thru. And rest assured, after working in customer service for years I do my very best to be a polite and courteous customer.

AITA for taking a guess at someone's social identity based on their behavior in an anonymous online game?,"I joined an empty online room in the middle of the night on a competitive game to work on coordinated achievements (like score 500 assists or score 1000 kills) with friends. Eventually another player joins in our room, and they get locked into our designated losing team. They try to disrupt our system, so I play defensively and withhold points from them (in hopes they would lose interest and leave or attempt to join in on our coordinated system). Then, they tell me I'm not playing the game correctly, and I ""started at"" them by hitting them first (even though they grabbed a resource and attempted to score first). So they explained they are now going to stall our progress by intentionally bugging out the match (which they did successfully for about 15 mins). 

I'm used to people being bored and wanting to give others a bad time out of dominance and power-stroking their ego. So my strategy is to make all of us stay logged in, not move, not give the griefer any attention, and wait it out until they get bored and leave. Neglecting the player caused them to message me more. They explained they are doing this to punish me for being an *sshole, and that they would have left already if I wasn't abusing them and the game. At this point I tell them we are doing nothing wrong, we are trying to be courteous to other players by joining an empty map on off-peak hours, and I accused them of not even attempting to communicate or coordinate with us before deciding to be (unjustifiably) self-righteous. They responded by repeating their belief that I ""started with"" them.

So out of frustration and spite I respond with, ""So illogically. So emotional. Lemme guess, youre a woman irl."" I actually expected the player to be a young boy, but the reaction surprised (and honestly entertained) me. Our empty room fills up with other players within minutes, and they all started flooding me with messages accusing me of harassing ""her.""

I still have no respect for that player or their friends, and I don't regret my last comment because it felt like the most offensive thing I could say to an anonymous player, but now I question if I'm generally hateful/close-minded/thinking of people too categorically. I know stereotypes are problematic, inaccurate of every individual within the group (the outliers), and offensive to some. But, is it morally wrong to feel like (good and bad) stereotypes aren't created out of thin air, and that they can have some truth/merit to them when looking at a group as a whole (especially if those stereotypes have supporting statistics or science behind them)? Or, would I be more objective/morally correct if I discredited all stereotypes and attempted to view every new person I meet without comparing them to stereotypes?",Asshole

AITA for forcing my dad to be vegan as a condition of living in my home?,"My elderly dad is no longer able to live by himself, and he lived in a nursing home for about several months. But his experience there was absolutely awful, so he is now living with my husband and me instead.

Our household is vegan, and we don't allow non-vegan foods in our home. My dad hates this, but it is one of the conditions of living here. There are also practical reasons for this as well: since my dad can't drive or really do anything by himself, that means that my husband and I do all of the grocery shopping and cooking for him.

When I was a teenager several decades ago, I tried to be a vegetarian. I was able to do so for about 3 days, until my dad forced me to eat meat under the threat of taking away everything that I own. So he really doesn't even have any moral authority to complain about our rule at all. He hasn't even ever apologized to me for this.

He has been living here for about 2 months, and he is still very bitter about it. AITA?

**UPDATE:** After reading many of your comments, a number of you have suggested that alternate living arrangements should be made for him. I took this advice, and told him that if he does not behave himself, he is going to be sent back to the nursing home. This threat seems to have worked so far, since there has not been any complaining during mealtimes at all since then. We will see what the future holds.

As for the health angle, we understand the official position of the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27886704/), which is that vegan diets are appropriate for all stages of life including older adulthood.

AITA for 'stealing' a story idea from a 12 year old?,"This occured several years ago when I was just 19.  It was mentioned during an outing with friends recently, whose immediate responds was I'm an asshole. Judge me Reddit.

Well no, not really, but I write stories and post them on writing websites to collaborate with other aspiring authors. I once found a story I genuinely liked the plot of - writing websites aren't known for gifted writing - but hated the turn it took and overall, the general tone. The author was 12 so I never expected much. I took the idea, drabbled with it and made it my own. There wasn't many similarities other than plot, characters and climax. I received phenomenal support from others on this website and attain quite a large group of readers. Now this other version, the 12 year old's, wasn't very popular, especially compared to mine. She approached me, admitted something I didn't need to hear (bad parents, no friends, bullied, writing was her only escape, blah, blah, blah) and asked me to take down my story. I didn't because that wasn't her right to ask me. Someone starts the rumor I 'stole the idea'. My readers didn't take this to well. In attempt to defend me they called this 12 year old a lot of names, small things like loser, retard, freak, idiot, told her her writing was shit, it sucked. I didn't particpate in any name caller so I don't blame myself for that.

AITA for not wanting my wife to give expensive gifts to my son,"Not wanting my wife to give expensive gifts to my son

I have a son with my ex wife. We got divorced when he was around the age of 11 ( he is now 16 ). I cheated with another women and she didn’t really managed to “fulfill” me. We aren’t exactly friends but we don’t hate each other. In the other hand, my relationship with my son has worsen since our divorced. He is very distant to me, he seems more close to his mom boyfriend than to me. And it got to the point in which I kinda gave up. I had him each other weekend, at first we went out to see movies or to visit his grandparents. But recently I have seen how he doesn’t seem to care. He doesn’t really want to visit me and there had been a couple of weekends in which he simply decided to not visit me.

So, basically a couple of weeks before Christmas I was planning with his mother what we would do in Christmas and new year. We decided thta j was going to get him in New year and her in Christmas. Out of curiosity I asked her what she was going to gift our son. Apparently because he has been a very good student this last years she decided to buy him a new and better PC ( my son loves videogames and apparently he complained about his computer not being good enough for playing those games ). And this PC wasn’t cheap. I don’t remember how much did it cost but it was considerably expensive. I told her that it was too much money for a gift to a kid. And this started an argument. Like I said, she makes more money than me and thus her gifts are more expensive than mines ( for example a couple of years she bought him a ps4 ). 

My problems with this are two. 1: I don’t want my kid to be a spoiled kid, sure he has been good at school but he hasn’t really worked for it, not even in a symbolic way. I’m afraid that he will believe that his mother will buy him all he wants without working. 2: This is also something bad for my relationship with my kid. Like I said, I don’t have a good relationship with him but I’m trying to fix it. And her giving him these kind of gifts will only reinforce the idea of her being a better parent than me.

Unfortunately, she gift it anyways and the relationship with my son is still bad. I’m very angry at her about this, but maybe I’m wrong? I have been trying to think about recently and I have still not got to a conclusion.",Asshole

For context our front door isn't really easily visible from where they were and they would have already had to be looking at kind of an odd angle to see in our house. It's not really an angle you'd just accidentally glance into. I acknowledge that people accidentally look into other people's spaces all the time, but what pushed it over the edge is they drew someone else's attention to it and commented on it within earshot of us.

I know this isn't a particularly juicy story, but personally I feel justified in saying that to them, whereas my partner is annoyed that I said something, and feels it was rude of me.

WIBTA if i told my mom that i dont consider her family?,"edit: i realize that i would be in the wrong here! it would be rude to tell her such a thing, regardless- i have explained to her why i feel i should get a lock, she refused, so be it, unfortunately. thank you to the people suggesting nicer ways to bring this up!! it was really helpful.  


so. the title sounds really bad, i know, but to explain a bit i (18, nonbinary) am turning 19 next month. earlier this evening, my mother came in and asked why i asked for a lock on my door for my birthday. i explained to her that i just wanted the privacy, and since i shared a room with my sister when i was younger, and the house we live in now doesnt have door locks, i wanted to have that sense of security.

my mom,,, flipped. her concerns were valid, things like ""what if you get hurt at night and i cant get in?"" which,, i think, is genuinely fair. HOWEVER her concerns also included ""doing horrible things on the internet"" and ""talking to people she doesnt know"".

i feel as though i must reiterate that i am an ADULT at this point. i give my mom money when she asks, i have my own job, have graduated high school, etc. i feel like its unfair to control how i use the internet, especially when i bought my computer myself and i pay for half the costs of the internet.

this isnt a new development in my life, my moms always been like this;; my issue arose when she said that ""she felt as though she never saw \[me\],"" and that ""as family, she has a right to come in whenever she wants."" she also threatened to take the door off the hinges if i paid for the lock myself.

i do not consider her family, considering how shes treated me. i do tend to avoid her as much as possible, which definitely might make me an AH, considering she does buy me gifts and will take me places if i ask // cant drive that day.

would i be an AH for telling her i dont consider her family?? should i tell her in a nicer way that i want privacy?? my dad just says to take the path of least resistance, and my siblings said it would be rude and that i should be more respectful. would i be in the wrong here???

EDIT: people are assuming i just dont hang out with my mother for whatever old reason, and thats definitely not the case- i dont hang out with her since shes either treated me like a second parent, or essentially an emotional punching bag- i haven't really spoken to her since i was around 13, because she used to comment on my weight/looks a lot and would take things out of my room if i did something she didnt like (often including sketchbooks and diaries she'd look through.)

id also like to add that when my older brother got his first girlfriend, my mom threatened to TAZE him and took EVERYTHING out of his room including his bed frame. i didn't want to add all of this, as i felt it was irrelevant to the post, but i don't believe my mom is looking out for me here.

WIBTA if I abandoned my cat?,"So, I live in a large city with two rescue cats, Satchmo (m,5yo) and Billie (f,2yo). They get along *ok* \- like siblings who squabble a lot. Satchmo is a classic siamese/tonkinese cat - quirky, funny and affectionate but finicky about how you pet him (he's sensitive about his hind-quarters) and has been known to bite. He doesn't bite me because I can read his body language (he gives a long warning stare if he doesn't like how you're petting him) but he bit a friend so hard that it left puncture wounds and ended up getting infected. While I like Satchmo, Billie is the feline love of my life. I rescued her as a kitten and she's pretty much imprinted on me. Unfortunately, she also occasionally beats on on Satchmo, grabbing him by the nape of the neck and body slamming him. Basically, they aren't bonded and don't get along all the time.

In late mid-February I flew down with the Billie (she's a good traveller) to visit my parents for a few weeks, leaving Satchmo in the hands of a neighbor. The city I live in ended up becoming a COVID epicenter so I stayed put at my parents'. I normally live by myself in a tiny and overpriced on bedroom so I would've lost my mind during quarantine (my cats would've become my Wilson like in Castaway).

Here's where we get to my quandary: Before quarantine, I had been considering moving back to my hometown and COVID pretty much solidified the decision. I plan on living with my parents for a few more weeks after moving to save (I'm unemployed). The problem is that my dad will not allow Satchmo to live in the house. He suggested I offer to give him to my neighbor, since she's enjoyed spending time with him, and if she doesn't want him, find a good home through a no-kill adoption agency (I would stay and foster him at home through the end of my lease in Aug). At first, I was really upset about it and tried to argue but my dad stood firm: no Satchmo.

I firmly believe that when you adopt a pet, you're making a commitment to care for it for life so this situation has me feeling very torn. On one hand, Satchmo is not a good traveller, doesn't love Billie, he's a popular breed and could benefit from a quieter home with fewer guests. On the other hand, I feel like I'm breaking a commitment, that Satchmo might not find the right home (he has a heart murmur and IBD which might make him harder to adopt out) and I could just go for broke and move directly into a new apartment instead of staying at my parents'.

So I ask all of my fellow redditors and humbly await your judgement: WIBTA if I re-homed Satchmo?

AITA For Making Nasty Comments About My Aunt When I Thought She Couldn’t Hear Me?,"Now that I’ve typed it out, the title sounds worse than this is. I feel mostly justified in my actions, but I suppose this is mostly for some reassurance/venting. But I’m interested to see what others may think.

So, we had to put my family dog down last Friday. He lived a good life, a fourteen year old yellow Labrador retriever. He was a birthday present when I was five, and he grew up with me. I’ve shed a lot of tears over him, and so did everyone else in my family. We sent him to get cremated and had an in-home euthanasia, so his last memories were in the house and we didn’t have to go through the trauma of burying him.

The next day we had a family BBQ at my grandmother’s. Just my immediate family (mom and dad, sister), my grandparents, and my uncle and his wife and daughter. I’ve never really liked my aunt and cousin, as they both have suffered from “spoiled brat syndrome.” They were all aware of the situation that my family had gone through.

And yet my aunt thought it was a great day to bring her new black lab puppy to meet everyone.

As you can probably guess, I was furious. I said nothing, just seethed quietly with my mother and sister (my father is, as always, oblivious to uncomfortable situations) in the backyard. Then, I decided I needed a breather to call my boyfriend. I excused myself and went inside and hid out in the spare bedroom. 

I called and went off. Told him the situation and how pissed I was. Called my aunt a few choice words too. I wasn’t mad at my cousin or the dog; my cousin is 10 and the dog is a dog. Hell, I even knew my uncle was innocent, as he’s just a pushover to my aunt’s whims. But she knew what she was doing and I just know it.

Well, I’m halfway through my call, when I hear loud talking in the kitchen, and it’s my aunt and uncle. I automatically lower my voice down another octave, as the walls were thin. But I’m sure they may have heard me. They left maybe 20 minutes after.

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone who replied to this. I appreciate your sympathies and not being too terribly harsh. I realize I am TA and I will take that in stride. I think my grief turned into misdirected anger, which I’ll be sure to keep a better eye on. I was totally in the wrong here, and I could’ve handled this better. I’m still not sure if I’ll apologize, as I am not 100% sure my aunt heard, but I’ll watch my attitude and treat her as best as I can.",Asshole

AITA Moms opinion on my hair,"So. As you guys now. Its 2020!! However. My mom had broken her second promise. For the same thing. My hair.And I need to know. Am I the asshole for being mad at her? She told me, every day. Shed cut my hair. Shed let me get a guys cut. Then she backed out, because its ""Not what SHE thinks would be good for me"" telling me that Im a girl, therefore, i HAD to have long hair. That if I got a guys cut, or any hair cut over my shoulders, SHE'D be upset and SHE wouldnt like it. Should I follow up with my one week plan that, if she doesnt let me get my hair cut, ill cut it myself? Ive had some people tell me im just being selfish. Wait till im 18. But i cant for bullying reasons. And self confidence issues. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my friend toxic because she makes me feel she doesn't like me?,"So there's a lot of background and context to this that I might have to skim through, but essentially I have this friend (we'll call her Louise) who is also my housemate and course-mate at uni. I've also had significant issues with feeling unwanted and that I'm not good enough - I don't really have many friends. For the first year and a half at uni, me and Louise got on perfectly well, albeit we weren't particularly close.

Then I opened up about my mental health issues to her. This was about a year ago, and it's all been downhill since then. I've talked to her about how I feel no-one likes me or values me, she asked if this included her and I said yes, so she asked what she did to make me feel that way. So I told her: she never talks to me unless I talk to her first; she never asks whether I'm ok; never invites me out to do things with her, and tries to make excuses when I invite her; not opening up to me about herself or her feelings; and a million and one other things. (For clarity, I didn't say all of this at once, this was in a variety of conversations over the last year, and always after she asked). Despite this none of her behaviour ever changed.

She has said in the past how I make her feel like a bad friend by saying this stuff, so I stopped. She also said a month or so ago that she doesn't want to live with me again next year, because she feels she's constantly being analysed for things that show that she doesn't like me. However, it does genuinely feel to me that she doesn't care for me, and it was incredibly damaging to my mental health, making me feel alone, unwanted, unloved and worthless.

So about a week ago I said this to her, told her how she made me feel, and asked her to try to be better (I didn't word it that harshly, I can't remember my exact words). She apologised for making me feel bad, but nothing has changed. Then a few days ago I knocked on her door to ask how she felt towards me, because I just felt a tension hanging over us which I wanted to resolve. She started crying, asked if we could talk about it another time and said she felt put on the spot, so I left her alone.

The next day she apologised for crying, I said she didn't need to apologise and apologised for putting her on the spot. She then proceeded to ignore for three days, and then this morning she said she needed to take a break from me because she felt it was too much. I then said that I felt she was a toxic presence in my life and I couldn't carry on having her in my life as a result, as she was unwilling to make any changes. She's yet to reply to this. As I said, she feels that I overanalyse everything she does and says and make her feel like a bad friend, by highlighting things she sees as innocuous as being evidence she doesn't like me. For my part, I feel that she is being a bad friend, and I'm just highlighting how she's being a bad friend.

So, AITA for wanting to cut her off, and for calling her toxic, or is she right and I'm blowing things out of proportion?",Asshole
AITA for being upset that my Nana went to my favourite place with my cousin without me,"Ok for some backstory, I have a little cousin, he is my absolute best friend and I love him more than almost anything. Another thing is that I love Coffee and going out to places so I love Costa. Every Sunday my little cousin has this little football game at this centre. I love going but usually I don't go, I understand why, it being early and everything but after most games we'd go to costa, me, my Nana and my cousin. Today I was at my aunties house and my Nana and grandad came round to help with her new couch. After it had been put in and everything, me and my Nana were sat on it and she said ""Just went to Costa, just me and Cousin."" I was a little annoyed and just said ""Why are you telling me this"" and she just snapped and said ""Oh don't whine WobbledWeenus. I could take you home eh? How's that sound?"" Instead of carrying on I just walked into the kitchen and talked to my mum. I didn't do it to snitch on her, I just talked to her because I was sad. My mum sort of agreed with me and said ""I don't understand why she does things like this"" my mum cheered me up and now I'm just worried that I came across as self centered. Before I finish, I'm just gonna say I'm not upset that she went without me, I'm upset that she tried to be all smug about it. AITA?

AITA for getting upset that girlfriend said she's smarter than me?,"My girlfriend (F22) and I (F20) were in a fight/argument earlier, which ended with her basically writing quite a long apology text / explanation. It was really good until the last part. I will provide the part that made me upset, but I won't include what she wrote before or after that, so it may seem weird out of context. But still, here's what she said: 

""I know that I have a lot of flaws, maybe too much. And I'm trying my very best to fix them. But I'm also (insert attribute), (insert attribute) and intelligent, much more than you even"". 

If she wants to think that she's super intelligent, then fine. She has called herself intelligent more than once, and although it makes me cringe for some reasons, it doesn't really hurt anyone. What bothered me with this situation though, is that she felt the need to include the ""even more than you""-part, like she had to prove that she's so much better than me or something. It was completely unnecessary, I don't understand why she had to put me down just to say something good about herself. I asked her why she's so sure that she's more intelligent than I am, and she couldn't even give me an answer. 

If this was true (or is true, who knows) then it wouldn't bother me. I wouldn't feel upset over her being more intelligent than I am. These are my problems:

1. The comment was so unnecessary, why did she feel the need to put me down? 
2. She said it like she's sure that she's more intelligent than me when there are NO PROOF of that. Literally none. She couldn't give me one single reason. 

She's very insecure and has been bullied for almost her whole life, so it could have been out of insecurity. But no matter what reason she had for saying that, it bothered me. So I told her that, that it made me feel like she wanted to feel like she's better than me and that there was no proof. 

Some time later my friend found out about the situation, she told me that I overreacted and should just have laughed it off. Now my friend is actually ANGRY at me for real, she stopped talking to me. She thinks I'm looking to start fights out of nowhere. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being upset my family expects me to pay for my brother's milkshake?,"I know this sounds incredibly cheap, let me explain: This post is about something that happened when I was in elementary school, but I'm still unnaturally salty about it and just need some gratification now.

When this all happened I was 7 or 8 years old. At that time I received an allowance of either 1€ or 1.50€ per week, I can't quite recall, and only if I remembered to ask for it. I'd forget maybe once every two months so that would leave me with ~4€ a month.

Then one day I was with my brother who is a little younger than me but also received a small allowance, like 50ct. (Which I found unfair to begin with, as my allowance started at 1€ when I was 6 years old and he was around 5 at that time). It was summer, so I suggested: ""Hey, let's go get some ice cream."". In the shop I bought like two scoops ore something, which came to 1.20€ at the time and my brother chose a milkshake for 4€. When it came to paying I found out he didn't carry any money and expected me to pay for him.

Since someone had to pay I did so and asked him to pay me back once we arrived home. Now, my brother is a cool guy and everything, but he's always been exceptionally cheap. He'd hunger the whole day to save money our parents gave us specifically for food when we went on trips. He whined about how he didn't know he'd have to pay for himself, how he thought I offered to pay and how he wouldn't have gotten anything otherwise. I can understand that part, if you never buy your own food, you are likely to misinterpret the suggestion to get ice cream for an invitation. As a parent, I might have taken care of the money and given a heads up for the next time. However, my grandmother took his side. She always had this mindset that, in her book, the older sibling is automatically the asshole if even barely justifiable. She was the second youngest in a large family and I kind of get it, but I think she should be over it by (at that time) 70 years of age.

[I always thought I'd get her reasoning when I grow older, that I was just a dumb kid and would be wiser by then, but now she does the same thing with my godchildren and I don't feel any different. Of course, my grandma loves me and I couldn't love her more, I just wish she'd understand that older children have feelings, too. Now back to the main event :)]

She said I should have made it clear what I meant and I shouldn't fuzz about 4€ if it made him happy. But why did my brother think it was ok to choose the most expensive thing that shop had to offer? Also, that was a month worth of savings.

By now, the money is not the big deal anymore. I wouldn't care if it was a good friend owing me that much. I know it's childish to still worry about ice cream we had in 2008 or something. Don't get me wrong, I had a great childhood and a wonderful family; just this one topic, my grandmother's ""ageism"" and my mother supporting it...

Am I really so wrong in how I think about it all?


Edit:

I know I shouldn't be bothered by something that happened so long ago and I'm normally not. I just got reminded of it by how my grandma does practically the same thing with her great-grandchildren now. I was not asking if I'm the asshole for holding on to my grudge (which I understand I am and I'm trying to let go. I definitely don't bring it up in conversation). I also wasn't implying that my brother was a douche, as you all said, he was five. I mainly wanted judgement on how my family went about it.

Also, for clarification: In German there is a noticeable difference in language between inviting to pay for ice cream and suggesting ""I'm getting ice cream, do you want to buy some to?""",Asshole
AITA for suggesting that my friends shouldn’t buy cheap high quality clothes from China?,"Tonight I was with some friends at my school’s library. One of my friends has a dad that is an exec in some company in China so her parents live there. Her mom is going shopping today at a market and offered to buy some high quality lululemon clothes and authentic sports jerseys for some of my friends because they are dirt cheap there. 

My thought is that for these clothes to be so cheap, the companies making them must not be paying their workers and that we’re probably looking at a sweatshop situation. I interjected that I wasn’t trying to be a dick or seem holier than thou or anything but that those clothes are probably not very ethically made and that they should maybe reconsider buying them. 

Well the girl didn’t appreciate this and responded that she’s seen how poor the people are firsthand and feels that she’s helping pay their salaries by supporting the business. 

Nobody spoke to me for the remainder of the time I was there and I feel like they’re annoyed that I said anything. I feel like I may have overstepped in saying something but also I felt convicted to say something.

AITA for suspecting my best-bud/roommate’s date of sterling my weed?,"So me and my buddy are in our early 30s and go way back. We’ve been roommates for a couple years, and we’ve both been incredibly unlucky when it comes to dating.

He recently had a blind date with a woman, things went well, and he brought her over a couple times. Last Tuesday, she came over and he hit a triple, nearly making it all the way to home base.

The next day, I noticed my doob tube of ground up weed had gone missing. I searched the house and couldn’t find it. On Thursday, I told my buddy about the missing doob tube, and he also searched around for it, to no avail.

I work from home, and voiced my concern that if his date had stolen it, then I was worried about what else she might take in the future. I was about to be gone for most of the week, and didn’t want to find things missing when I returned. He said he would ask her about it.

Last night, he had her over and they went out for pizza...and things didn’t go well. I don’t know exactly how he brought it up, but he told her that I had suspected her of stealing my doob tube. They talked about it for over an hour. He told me some of the things she said, which included: she’s a college grad so why would she need to steal my stuff, she can get her own stuff, she doesn’t want my stuff, and it’s immature for me to accuse her of something like that...That’s about all I remember him telling me.

She left him afterwards without even saying good bye, stating that it’s because she didn’t need to deal with that kind of stress in her life (she works with teenagers and young adults who are severe special needs cases).

I feel bad for bringing up my suspicions to him without video evidence or something, but after both of us searching the house and not finding my doob tube, it seemed extremely odd for my weed to go missing all of the sudden.

AITA For getting angry when my mom mentions her health?,"Let me get out a few things wrong with my mom. She is on oxygen 24/7. She has been for the past few years now. She is on it because she smoked for a really long time. My guess would be like 40 years. Mom is a little over 60. She can't do that much before it starts getting to her. An example could be vacuuming. It gets her tired very quickly. My husband and I live with my parents with our baby. I do all the cleaning and cooking for everyone. It has been like that for a very long time even before she got sick. She also had cancer awhile back. She had a liver taken out. She also takes a whole bunch of medications for idk what. She has a bunch of stuff. Asthma, stomach pain, just things that I am not familiar with yet. 

Anyway, almost daily she mentions how she shouldn't have cleaned something, or doing something was too much for her. I tell her leave it. I will get to it. You don't need to do it. She says she needs to do something but the things she does makes her tired, she can choose to do something easier if she wants to be active. Before she uses the treadmill she might eat, she might have just yogurt. Then she will say wow that took a lot out of me.( after using the treadmill) I hear her but don't acknowledge her everytime. The rest of the day she will go about not eating much at all. Then she might snack at like midnight or 2 in the morning. She complains about her having a stomach almost every week or 2. 

The other night she hadn't eaten dinner when she wanted to pop popcorn at like 12 at night. We said no, baby is sleeping. I told her dinner was fone at dinnertime. She said earlier that day she probably wasn't going to eat dinner because she ate at like 1. 

I blow up on her almost weekly. I say I don't want to hear about how much you can't eat, that you don't want dinner,  that you don't feel good. That you want to get rid of your stomach. That you are only going to eat this much because you can't eat a lot. 

Her doctor told her to eat 6 small meals a day, and i remind her of this. But she doesn't do it, saying she can't eat that much. Then I remind her to stop telling us all in the family what you did or didn't eat because we don't care. You keep doing it to yourself so I don't want to hear it. 

She gets annoyed and sad but I just can't take her comments everyday, she doesn't care for herself so I don't have the patience to listen to those comments daily. She just wants attention. 

AITA TLDR. I get mad at my mom when she comments about her weight or health but she is the one not taking care of herself.

AITA for asking my grandpa and step grandma how much they are giving me as a grad present,"I graduate high school in January. My friends and I have a tropical vacation planned. My grandpa and step grandma said they wanted to contribute towards the vacation as my graduation present. I didn’t ask for this and don’t expect gifts but they offered.


The trip is nearing and I still don’t know exactly how much they are contributing which is kind of holding me back. For example, I want a new phone but it’d take my bill from 70 to 120. Depending on how much he’s giving me determines on whether I get a phone now or wait until after my trip. 


We were at dinner the other night and I said “hey I was just wondering how much you guys plan to contribute to my vacation, I just need to know for planning stuff” my step gma laughs and says “you haven’t even graduated yet. Don’t worry about it”


I got defensive because I wasn’t trying to be rude so I said back “I was just asking so I could budget stuff!” She looks at my gpa and says “can you tell her to calm down” which made me even more mad so I said to my gpa “can you tell her not to be such a bitch. I’m sitting right here and I just asked a question”. Then she says “have you taken your meds today?” And that’s when my gpa started yelling and said “enough. We’ll talk about this later.

"AITA I dislike my friends using ""faggot"" as an insult even though we're all gay","This past semester I (19m) decided to try out LGBT+ socials at the campus and I met some people there. There's one lesbian girl and two gay guys who were already friends and they included me in their circle.

They have borderline offensive and pretty dark sense of humor. Sometimes I think they're genuinely funny but other times like what I'm going to describe now, it gets on my nerves.

So they throw around the word ""faggot"" casually and without much consideration. Maybe I'm too sheltered but I'm not a huge fan of that. This mostly bothers me when they use it as an insult... For example, if they don't like a person of whatever sexuality they'll say something like ""what a faggot"". Obviously it's meant in an insulting way, though wrapped as a joke. Or if they think something's boring or stupid they call it gay or faggy.

AITA if I point out that I dislike this?

I'm relatively new to the group since they've known each other for over a year and we've only been hanging out for 4-5 months, I don't know if it's overbearing of me to interfere with their dynamics.

WIBTA for calling the cops on my friends,"Context here needed. I absolutely, vehemently hate drugs. Every single drug. The only acceptable drug is alcohol, and only if your behaviour while drinking isn't harmful to yourself or anyone else. Drugs bad.

Anyway. My friends have recently decided a neat way to save money on the weekends is to ditch pubs and clubs, and drink alcohol and do - dangerous - amounts of ketamine, coke and LSD under a motorway overpass, which is a short walk down a bush trail. They have a fire going as well usually. Recently boltcutters have been mentioned for vehicle access.

I find this behaviour to be very very unacceptable and I think we're way too old to be doing this type of thing. I wouldn't have an issue if this was in a legal campground, but under a motorway? really?

I have nothing to gain from snitching, so even if I wasn't an asshole I wouldn't snitch.

But I absolutely deplore this behaviour from anyone, and maybe cops would provide a reality check.

I've already told them how much I disprove of what's happening (for what that's worth, lol), and can we please just go to a bar :(

AITA for having racist sentiments about the Chinese in my country?,"I'm a Filipino male in my late teens. I'm making this post because i am extremely confused about how I'm feeling - which is that my sentiments are invalid and that I'm a bad person for feeling this way. Please give your total honesty and criticism as much as you can, I want to move on and grow from this.

Anyway, here's my story. My government has been in cohorts with China. This country has built military installations on dredged reefs which supposedly belong to my country, angering both the environmentalist and nationalist in me. There's also a certain sense of fear that was instilled in me because of it. Recently, there has been an influx Chinese workers entering my country, and they have been taking jobs from my countrymen, which scares me as well. Stories of Chinese tourists ruining pristine tourist spots in my nation as well as their rudeness only made me more irate. There was a certain mixture of both fear and anger already brewing in me.

Recently, there has been a group of these Chinese who have moved in to the house next to me, and none of my experiences with them have been good. I've had instances of them cutting in line and pushing me at the local convenience store. They're also very rowdy and loud, drinking and partying every night and I often see them lying in their driveway in their underwear, passed out. They also crouch on the sidewalk, chain smoking with reckless abandon. I guess I then reached my tipping point when one of them genuinely scared the hell out of me. I was walking home rather late at night, and one of them, eyes wide open and red, he obviously high, and he was slurping his spicy noodles at an inhuman pace, was staring me down as I walked. I felt so uncomfortable, and scared that he could lunge at me at any moment, and for a moment he did get out of his chair and move forward. I just briskly walked and got the hell out, panting in fear. I hated that feeling, and just wanted them out of my country, stat. 
Now, I can't trust anyone of them, nor do I like the Chinese presence in my country. I look for ways to express this, and have made tons of racist remarks in my spite. Hatred and fear is all I feel about them. 

Here's where my confusion stems from, and this is why I'm turning to AITA. I know that they probably don't know any better, and that they are victims of oppression in their own country. By putting myself in their shoes, I sort of understand how it must feel to have an opportunity in another nation. But I can't help but still hate them. I know that if it were another race doing what they're doing, I'd hate them too. Them being Chinese would have nothing to do with it, it'd be the fact that they're acting how they are that would make me hate them. But I feel as if that's me just rationalizing or justifying my horrid, racist sentiments. But I can't help it. AITA for having these sentiments?

AITA for lying to my partner about when I want to propose to her?,"I probably am but please hear me out too.
This was in September.

I was really planning to propose this summer for a long time and I was already looking for the ring, I was really sure about it and I am just as sure today too.

What has happened was that she wanted me already to propose to her but this summer we move together and that would be my perfect moment I'd like to ask her the big question, but she didn't know it yet as I wanted it to be a surprise.

We were arguing once about this and to protect myself, I said some really dumb and bad lies.

First I said that I am not prepared yet and I don't think I am mature enough for this all and that I am afraid still etc. (tho this wasn't the case and I just had to have an alibi instead of telling her my plan)
And she got really upset as we were together for long enough already and our relationship was strong enough already and she was 1000% to say yes at any given minute. She got mad mad at me. She asked how can I say that after all of what we've been through etc.

Then I fucked up even more.
She told me that she wouldn't want to wait five years for me to propose as it is something I want or I don't and there is no room for hesitation in this case anymore in our relationship.

I told her that okay fuck you then, I wanted to propose to you this winter when you come home from the UK (currently we are doing a LDR due to her university studies abroad) but Fuck it I won't, I will do it then when you won't be this bitchy and selfish about that fucking ring!

big bad point for me

She got mad² at me and broke down.

I told her that it was a lie I was using to protect my real plan to propose to her in the summer as we move together in the UK but she didn't believe me anymore after all of these lies as she couldn't trust my word anymore in this.

This all happened in the timespan of a week through skype to make things worse. 

She still doesn't believe me tho I have talked with her about it many times since telling her the same thing as I am writing now too. I fucked up but I told her the truth in the end and since then I told her when I'll ask her hand and that ""she will soon be my fiancée believe me"" (she told me before that she's not too sure about how she'll respond after all of this and that I shouldn't do it as she doesn't want me to play around with this anymore.)

I even measured her finger's size to pick the right ring. I even talked about styles and metals too what she prefers.

She is not that mad anymore as I see but she still gets upset if she hears how this and that proposed to each other and stuff.

My wife's best friend, ""Lily"", came by my house the other day to drop something off for my wife. Lily and I have also become quite close through my wife, and we often go out for dinner together with her and her husband. She dropped in and then as we were conversing she mentioned that she noticed a strange lump on her breast and was wondering if I could take a look at it. 

I didn't think twice about it, and brought her into a different room. Note: my wife was not home at the time. I felt her breast and told her that everything was okay, and she thanked me, and went on her way. I have performed over 100 breast examinations and it did not seem like a big deal to me at all, just a simple medical examination.

I did not tell my wife that this happened, not for the purpose of keeping my action a secret, but because I did not think I should discuss Lily's medical concerns with my wife. Lily told my wife a few days later, and my wife became upset at me both for performing the examination and for not telling her about it.

My wife said that I could have simply told Lily to see her family doctor rather than ""feel her breasts"" myself. She understands that it is a medical examination of course, but still thinks it is weird that I saw and felt her best friend's breasts, which I do understand. She said it will now be in the back of her mind whenever the three of us get together.

It is true that I simply could have told her to book an appointment with her physician, and I could have considered the possibility that the information would be weird for my wife. However I felt like I was just doing my friend a favor and it would be inconvenient to make her book a whole appointment for something I could quickly do on the spot.

AITA for charging new roommates 'market rent' and pocketing the difference?,"I live in a house with 4 roommates. Our landlord is super chill and hasn't raised the rent much in 4 years so we are paying well under market rate. As roommates leave (say they are paying $500) and new roomates come in we charge the new roommate the market rent (say $700)  and reduce all existing roommates rent evenly. 

This ends up producing some strange room payments where there are 2 identical rooms and one person is paying $200 more than the other. 

Is this fair? Is it assholish? It's always akward when the new roommate finds out what we all are paying.",Asshole
AITA for getting upset with my wife about PUBG?,"For those who don’t know, PUBG is a popular third-person shooter battle royale game. My (27M) wife (28F) and I have been playing PUBG together on our phones for about a year and a half (important), and we usually have a great time together. Admittedly, I’m much better at the game than she is, but she has gotten much, MUCH better over time, and is able to hold her own in most situations.

Anyway, we were playing recently when I was “downed” by some nearby enemies (basically, I got shot, but was still alive crawling on the ground). Sitting on the couch next to each other, I told her, “I’m down! They’re right on me.” She responded, “Where?” I replied, “Right on me, just in front of me!” She again replied, “WHERE??” then was was shot and killed by the same players.

(((Context: The thing about PUBG is that when you’re on a team (as we were), you can see each other’s location using a map in the upper-right corner (on mobile). I have been trying to teach my wife about how to easily/quickly know my location for over a year, and she hasn’t quite “gotten” it yet (that she can view her mini map and see me instantly). It’s burdensome to describe my location hoping she’ll know what I’m talking about.)))

I became frustrated after we both died and said, “I’m sick of this! You should be able to know where I am, at all times, using the map, it shows you right where I am.” Somewhat understandably, she became upset and told me, “I’m sorry if it’s difficult for me!” I replied, “It’s not a matter of difficulty, it’s a function of the game, we’ve been playing this forever, the map literally tells you where I am.”

She became more upset, walked away, and now I’m locked out of the bedroom for the night. Reddit, I’m genuinely interested, AITA?",Asshole

AITA Telling my wife to stay out of my work life,"Here's some background I suppose, I am 38 year old, I have been  married for the last 12 years to my wife.

I have a personal secretary/assistant who is pretty young, she's 23 years old and good looking. Recently my wife came in unannounced in to the workplace and somehow walked up to my office without me being alerted about this, she walked in without knocking and I was just sitting down talking to the secretary, I was also drinking a small glass of beer, no big deal right? We work together, we might as well be friendly, and my wife didn't seem too upset either.

Then I got home and she started making strange remarks , saying that she didn't think a married man should be so friendly with a young woman and started saying that I don't care about her enough which is completely false.

This culminated in my wife ringing me at work and asking me and engaaging in conversation , I liked this for 10 minutes until I said I had to go and she got upset and made a sarcastic remark about the secretary. I then told her to stay out of my work life and that she didn't need to have anything to do with it.

AITA for naming my daughter after my ex girlfriend?,"I had a girlfriend in college that is to this day still the love of my life. 

A couple years ago we reconnected face to face. 

She’s been in trouble with the law and when she was incarcerated we wrote each other whenever we could and when she got out I got her a job at my business and helped pay for her first apartment. 

We began talking about the fact that she became pregnant with my baby when we were dating but she miscarried. She told me that she didn’t tell me before but it’s a girl.

Around that time my wife got pregnant and happened to get pregnant right when I was going to call quits on our passionless marriage. We were barely having sex and I was only doing it with her out of pity for her constant nagging. 

I felt so trapped by the baby and every day going home was like preparing myself for the hell that was playing house with a frigid emotional robot. 

I was tortured by what could be and when the baby was born I realized the only way I could stand to stay in the sham that was my marriage was to have something to remind me of happiness. So I suggested the name “ Amber” and my wife agreed to the name. 

Now my daughter is 7 and my wife discovered that I’ve been working everyday with my ex girlfriend and helping her secure good higher end places to live. 

She blew up and said she can’t even look at our daughter now. But when we were discussing names she was the frigid one who just shrugged at everything I said, and now she wants to put the blame back on me. 

And she wants to rob me of the fact that most parents name their kids after something significant to them. Aka she wants me to pretend those feelings for my ex girlfriend never happened. That she can treat me snippily for years on end and still have 100 percent of my affection.

Aita for calling my sisters boyfriend gay,"Okay this is kinda long. I’m a 23 year old senior in college and my sister is a sophomore in college. We are from a middle upper class Italian American family. We all kinda share the same views on a lot of things. We are generally religious and pretty conservative politically. Well besides my sister. She went to college and made some new friends. She is now very leftist and now says she is atheist. Not a big deal but sometimes her and I get into little fights about stuff. 

So more background is that I went through a tough year after my first semester away at college. I dropped out for a year before returning, which is causing me to graduate a year behind everyone I started with. My sister gets very good grades and has been on the deans list every time. 

She recently has been making a lot of nasty comments about my schooling. Like when I got my internship last summer she made a sarcastic comment how I should have had an internship years ago. She makes a lot of comments how I haven’t graduated. 

Now onto her boyfriend, she has never been into typical “mans man” type of guys. She’s always like the artsy fartsy type. Her boyfriend now though... paints his nails takes her to operas and has... the typical gay sounding voice. Nothing wrong with that I’m just stating that he has that voice has that sound to it. We all know what I’m talking about. 

Here is the actual incident, we were at dinner a month ago and my aunt was asking me about my graduation this May. She made a comment about how it should have been last May, and how I dropped out blah blah. I responded with “I don’t know why you think you’re so smart. You think you can make all these comments on how I’m behind when you’re too dumb to realize your boyfriend is totally gay” she left the dinner. And I haven’t spoken to her since. My family says it wasn’t right of me to insult her boyfriend. 

I see I’m an asshole for responding and continuing the fight, but why is what I said so much worse than what she said? I don’t think so. And I do not feel I owe her any apology until I get one

AITA for joining my cousin on her bed when she was asleep and inadvertently spooning her because I saw a cockroach when I slept on the floor?,"I [19M] am visiting my cousin [23F] and some friends in Chicago for a few days. My cousin let me stay at her place. We’re pretty close. She shares a studio apartment with her boyfriend, who is currently away on a business trip. They have a full size bed, but we were both more comfortable having me sleep on the floor. She gave me a thick blanket to use as my mattress and a small blanket to use as my blanket. It was cold but I could bear it for just three nights. Last night was the first night. I couldn’t sleep well. 


At around 2am, I saw a cockroach on the floor near me and was scared. I don’t know what tools she has to catch them, so I just it live. I decided to sleep on her bed for the rest of the night. Since she was sound asleep on one half of the bed, I didn’t want to wake her up and ask for permission to join her. I used the thick blanket she gave me and fell asleep on the other half of the bed. I must have thought she was my ex-girlfriend and inadvertently spooned her when I was asleep since around 5am, she woke me up by taking my arm off her waist and shouted “why the fuck are you spooning me?” I told her about the cockroach I saw on the floor. She said she has never seen a cockroach before in her apartment and I was just making an excuse to spoon her. 


I tried to convince her that I certainly saw a cockroach and I inadvertently spooned her since I was asleep and it must have been instinct to find comfort in the person lying next to me. She said she didn’t know I was such a creep and capable of doing this to her and told me to stay with my friends the next two nights. I asked her if she would believe my innocence if I found the cockroach. She said no and told me to get out of her apartment. I tried to plead my innocence again but she started shouting so I left. I didn’t apologize to her or try to convince her of my innocence anymore. I think only time has the chance to change her opinion.

AITA for expecting intimate pictures/conversations from my wife?,"  

So my wife(23F) and I(24M) have a bit of a conflict regarding sexual conversations and pictures. I want them and she is not super comfortable with them. Early on in our relationship we would have very intimate conversations because we were both virgins and had no idea what we were really talking about, however, now that we are married and have experienced sex, conversations like that don't exist anymore and she feels really uncomfortable with it because it's not realistic compared to what we would actually do. 

Now I wouldn't have a problem with this setup because I'd rather just have sex, but I am in the military and I'm just finishing up a 6 month TDY away from her. Over the 6 months she's sent me a few pictures of the same pose and no sexual conversations. I have a very overwhelming sex drive and my primary reasoning for expecting more from her is because I get tempting into pornography, which not only goes against my religious beliefs, but I have also seen the negative side-affects it can have on a person and I'd prefer to stay away.

My personal feelings on this are like this; I feel bad for expecting more from her because I don't want to put her in a position where she feels awkward or uncomfortable, however, it's extremely hard for me to abstain from any sexual acts for 6+ months at a time and I'd really prefer if she could just get into it like we used to and where revealing clothing, try different poses, have sexy conversations, etc.

AITA for not allowing my boyfriend to wear a particular shirt?,"My boyfriend is pretty chubby (6'0"" and 250-260 pounds, depending on the day) and carries a lot of his weight in his belly (he honestly looks pregnant, especially after we eat).  While I'll admit that I'd prefer him thinner (what girl wouldn't?), I've never pressured him to lose weight because he's confident in himself and has other positive traits (smart, kind, etc.).

Yesterday we were walking around the touristy part of our city just for fun, and we saw [this shirt](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Pa0RbFVFL._CLa%7C2140,2000%7C61c7qwSLLiL.png%7C0,0,2140,2000+648.0,529.0,809.0,971.0._UX342_.png) in a random gift shop.  My boyfriend thought it was a hilarious way to poke fun at himself and bought it immediately.

What I didn't realize until he put it on today is that he got a large instead of the extra large he usually wears.  It leaves nothing to the imagination and makes it incredibly obvious how big and round his belly is.  He apparently did this on purpose because he thought it'd be funnier if the shirt was a little snug.  I told him that I'm not a fat shamer, but I am not going out in public with a guy who looks like he's smuggling a bowling ball under his shirt.  It's embarrassing.

AITA for coaching my students this way?,"I coach Academic Decathlon (google it) and recently we have been working on speeches. I also teach science and other related subjects as a high school teacher. 

There is this one female student that I coach who is a decent speech writer but is not the best public speaker. 

In contrast, I have another student who's been in drama for many years and is a natural speaker. When the first student I mentioned was struggling with expression and hand motions for her speech, he picked up a random pencil and said ""this pencil has more expression than you."" 

Her other teammates also joined in with (what I thought was) constructive criticism, and the first student I mentioned started crying.  

The next day, the girl came in to talk to me privately to let me know that her family dynamics at home caused her a lot of trauma and that what happened with the pencil comment made her feel worse. 

I let the female student take a break from practicing speeches for a while,  but I didn't admonish the male student who made the pencil comment because she is 16 and she has a tough world ahead of her. I remained neutral and didn't comment either way. However, I believe that all criticism is something to be learned from and something that can make us stronger regardless of the content.

There were also other students who helped out and also many who just showed up to listen to presentations and participate in discussions.

My friend and I helped out with technological side of one presentation on Friday, but we also sat through it because we were interested in the topic (she was talking about women in slasher movies and we like horrors so...). I had a bit of surprise though when this guest lecturer who was visiting from France took off her jacket and very clearly wasn't wearing a bra underneath her blouse. Some people in the first row I noticed were a bit embarrassed when she'd go closer, like they didn't know where to look. It's not like she had huge breasts and they were completely showing but since this is a formal presentation at uni and not idk, a night out with your girlfriends, I felt like that was inappropriate. For context we live in an East EU country and this isn't common.

So after the lecture when my friend and I went out for a snack and coffee, I commented something like ""What was that braless stunt about?"" and joked about the poor people in the front row. My friend got a bit mad and said, what about it, it's not like she has D cups so it wasn't that distracting. I just pointed out how it seemed pointless and inappropriate for the setting. My friend disagreed and called me primitive, and she said I should've focused more on the lecture because it was good, and not someone's tits.

Goes like this: I'm a 21 year old single guy and at the start of the year I purchased my first home. Fairly modest two bed one-and-a-half bath in a part of town that is neither super fancy or super ""rough"". Neighbours are very friendly. The people who live across the road have a son who is the same age as my niece and nephew (twins, they're all 6). Niblings hang out with me a lot on weekends/when school is off as my sister is a single mother who works days and I mostly work nights, so I watch them while she works. He's a sweet kid and an only child, so he comes to play at my place a lot when they're over. 

Now, over the course of these few months, their son has consistently made comments that were weird but not *that* concerning. Example: he called a barbie doll a ""whore"" and I asked where he heard that word, he said his dad had yelled it at his mum. I figured they'd fought in front of him and it was inappropriate but not cause for actual alarm. However the comments are getting increasingly frequent and increasingly concerning. Like, a few weeks ago we were at the park and a group of teenagers who reeked of weed walked past us. Kid says ""that smells like mummy's special cigarettes!"" And then continued that ""she needs them to cope with daddy"", but laughed as if it was a joke. There was also a day where he came to my place in his pyjamas at noon and said daddy hadn't got up to get him dressed because he drank too much special juice last night. He's also used more swear words and insults and said he heard his parents shouting them at each other. Most concerning is he sometimes comes to my place to ask for dinner because his parents were too busy shouting at each other or forgot to make him any. 

I'm really concerned for this kid. I want to call CPS or the police, but some people are telling me I'm meddling. When I've spoken to the parents they seem like perfectly normal nice people and the things the kid says surprise me for them but I know as well as anyone how people seem in public and how they actually are can be different.

AITA for giving my wife’s old clothes away?,"Ever since my wife (33) gave birth to our twin daughters she’s been in and out of the hospital due to heart issues and endometriosis. 

She complains all the time about growing white hair overnight and being unable to fit into any of her shoes because her feet are so bloated. 

She also can’t be far from a bathroom, to the point where she’ll have to stop changing one of the babies in order to go.

So I decided to hire a nanny (21F) who turned out to be a godsend. She is a rising senior in college and gave us very reasonable rates. She is able to juggle two babies with a big smile on her face. 

Last Friday my wife went to the ER because of a high fever and stabbing pain. The doctors ended up keeping her there throughout the weekend. 

So I ask the nanny if she can stay over until my wife gets back ( I work a lot) and she says yes. 

I wake up Saturday morning and see her online shopping. She says a lot of the good stuff is really expensive and I feel bad for her. 

I realize that my wife’s feet will probably never shrink enough to fit in her shoes, nor did I think she wanted her feet to be spilling over in them.

In addition, she had previously thrown a bunch of her clothing to me saying babies made her a “size 10.” She also tends to buy stuff in this season.

So I told the nanny that my wife didn’t like the stuff in her closet and to have at it. She was extremely grateful and picked out quite a few items and ended up taking them home. 

My wife gets back from the hospital and starts screaming at me asking where her stuff was. I told her what happened and explained myself and she accused me of trying to replace her.

My defense was that why keep stuff that you can’t wear and she ended up giving me and the nanny the silent treatment.

When I was dating this guy, he started hanging out with an old childhood friend that went to the same home school as us. I am 2 years younger then them so I didn't really know this person. 

Around the 5 -6th time hanging out I'm complaining about a girl from work that told me she thought I was stuck up for not immediately befriending her when I started working at the same company - she and every girl that started after us quickly became bathroom buddies. NEVER MIND that I've been nothing but nice to everyone, if a little reserved. We didn't share any interests and I'm not one for idle chatter. I let it slip that this if one of the reasons I REALLY don't like women. 

This apparently offended the friend so she asked me to describe what I thought SHE was. So I said that she was a butch person. She flipped out because 1) ""butch"" is a descriptor ONLY lesbians can use! 2) calling her a ""person"" was extremely offensive to her because someone had told her she wasn't a woman before due to her looks and orientation 3) no wonder I never spoke to her in high school! (...what? We graduated half a decade ago, what does that matter?)

I've asked a few LGBTQ people and I've been assured the use of the word butch as a descriptor was in no way derogatory. And as angry as I am that anyone had the nerve to say that to her, I think HER personal issues can't dictate what coping mechanisms I use to get by.

TL;DR: AITA for not being sensitive to this person's past trauma and calling her a person instead of a woman?

EDIT: since it keeps being brought up: when she first asked me to what she was I said a person (gender neutral for my own personal reasons so that the name and personality shine through an identified personal hang- up). When she pressed me to DESCRIBE her I added butch - a word SHE used to describe half the people at her vet's office before that day. Didn't think it changed what was said so I left it out.

EDIT 2: thanks to those of you I've spoken to I see what she was upset by. I saw the replacement of ""women"" with ""people"" as the SOLUTION to my hatred of the women due to those that made my life miserable. To her it meant something else very personal.

Don't know why it wasn't obvious to some people, but I am female.

And I did seek a counselor in college. But that was derailed when my work was destroyed by my female classmates and had to change majors to stay sane. My crime? Minding my own business and not striking up a friendship with them since I had a lot going on in my personal life that year. It's always been the females that have taken my non-interest as some sort of affront for some reason. I do the same with guys with no issue. The resentment isn't going away anytime soon, but I will keep working on it not affecting how I treat other people.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to participate in my niece’s gender transition,"So here is a couple info before we start this, so peoples will not miss out on any info. So, i am a 58 year old male, i grew up in a highly christian and conservative household (wich i still am both) my sister, (F51) has a son that was born a boy and recently realized he was a female (F16).

Things to keep in mind

-i love my nephew, he is the best nephew i could ever ask, i was there during his childhood. And i talk to him a lot

-i am christian and my sister is an atheist so we both have slightly different values

-in this thread i will refer my nephew as a she since, i know a lot of peoples are really sensitive about this topic.




So, last week i got a call from my sister, we started talking for hours, and hours i asked her how is her family doing (since i live in Florida and she lives in Virginia so we’re pretty far away from each other) she said everything was doing great, until, she brought up the big news, she told me that her son is now transitioning. I was pretty surprised to hear that at first but it wasn’t too much of a big deal. She told me that she is doing a fundraiser so her daughter can buy things needed in order to do the transition. Things like, girl clothes, hormones, and the rest for a surgery. While i stayed as polite as i could, i told her that i do not want to participate in this transition since, i do not think this is the right thing to do, and things like this are not part of my values. She then started arguing with me calling me a disgusting transphobe and then she hung up, she hasn’t talked to me for a week.

I’ve been thinking if i was wrong for that so i am her to ask, AITA for not wanting to participate in my niece’s transition??",Asshole

AITA for taking the instagram page i used to advertise my ex-gf’s onlyfans for my self?,"So basically my gf told me she wants to start an onlyfans with me few months ago, she started the  account and advertised it on reddit and I knew I could make much more audience by advertising on instagram, so I did but on the ig account I didn’t say it belonged specifically to her but was more of an account advertising us both as a couple -and was completely under my management- and the only fans was under her management.

We broke up about 5 days ago, I started dating a new girl and now changed the instagram page to advertising me and her and after my ex found out we were making more money than I ever did with her, she calls and tells me I’m an asshole for taking the account for myself and I kinda answered childishly ngl and said stop being pissed cuz I’m fucking a better pussy than yours and sells much more.

"AITA for not paying for my female friends on our yacht trip, but paying for the women that we wanted to impress on tour yacht trip?","Readding with proper details and from throwaway account as requested. 

My friends and I had a summer trip planned where we were all going to rent a pretty big sized boat and cruise down here from New Jersey to Florida. Before people ask we are renting out the yacht and split among 15 of us its not expensive at all, and it's not a 100m dollar yacht either.

It was me and 3 of my guy friends' original idea to do this. We are all single so we invited a bunch of women whom we would like to spend time with and we were going to pay for their share. We just asked that they bring drinks and snacks. The women we were inviting were either in college or broke so we just paid for them. Plus we have hung out before but we aren’t that close.

One of my friends posted about it on social media and then some of our female friends from college wanted to join us as well. So we decided to upgrade to a bigger boat and were completely down. However, we weren’t going to pay for their share, they are our friends not women we are interested in romantically, plus they all have money of their own lol.

Now, heres where things happen. Basically our trip we have a big group chat for. And when we were talking about refunds and that's how things came out. Our female friends are PISSED at us, they found it a bit skeevy before hand that the other group of girls we invited were 20-23 FWIW we are 28-29. Now, they are viewing this saying we think they aren't ""hot"" anymore and not worth being treated out.

I don't see it that way at all. Like we are treating them the same as we treat each other as guy friends. How is it at all bad? And we didn't ask them to cover for the other women just for their share of the trip. Also we didn't invite them either, they asked themselves to join us. They are comparing this to being rejected at a night club for being too old? I don’t see it that way at all. I don’t see it any different than buying a drink for a girl at a bar you don’t know vs splitting rounds with your friends. They don’t see it like that at all. They are really taking this super personally and think of us as assholes over this.",Asshole
AITA for throwing a tantrum after my mom told me that she would call me by my former first name?,"My mom and dad are fucking idiots but more my mom. My mom is native and my das is foreign so I guess I see why he wanted a name of his culture for me. The thing is that it’s selfish. We were always gonna live here in this country where my mom is from so this is basically like child abuse. 

Nobody has ever pronounced it correctly just by looking at the name. Even my own grandma doesn’t know how to pronounce it and thus just doesn’t use my first name ever. 

I’m 15 so I can legally change my name where I am. I have a great middle name that I would like to change to. I told my mom about this and guess what? She told me that she would always call me [Insert current name]. I got really mad and basically just said a bunch of rude stuff to her like that she is a fucking bitch and other very  vulgar stuff.

I feel kinda guilty now but I have seriously had enough of being ashamed of my first name.",Asshole

To explain further, we were just talking about realistically how much time we think of each other per day and I said 4%, but she thought I was joking. Seriously though, I'm no biologist but it probably takes 50% of human brain capacity to function doing everyday thing, and then there's school and other friends I have to think about... Taking all this into account, out of all nonessential tasks my brain is allocating energy towards, around an eighth of that is thinking of her so it's pretty sizable if you think of it that way!

AITA For getting mad at my father for buying me my first car?,"Don’t get me wrong, It’s not that I’m ungrateful or anything like that it’s just that money has been a bit tight for us since my grandad had to sell his business, his kidneys failed on him and now he’s on dialysis. The car itself is a 2012 Holden Cruze automatic with built in navigation and bluetooth, a very decent car which was $7000 AUD’s. But in all honesty i feel he should’ve used that money for something more important, like for his own personal use as he needs it more then i do, in my mind at least.

When he told me he bought it I won’t lie, i swore at him and called him a “fucking idiot” for buying me the car. He was adamant that i needed it but i am also adamant that he was an idiot when he needed the money more then me.

So am i the asshole for getting angry at my dad?

WIBTA for outing my ex-boyfriend as gay?,"So, back in high school---sophomore year---my best friend, a girl, started flirting with this guy in our German class, a known jock womanizer. She's always been insecure about being overweight, and she asked me constantly for advice about him.

I'm a closeted gay guy, and I harbored the biggest crush on this guy throughout high school, and when things got too brisk with my best friend and this guy, he and I were casual friends, and I used my influence to help them both together.

After high school ended and he moved away, I felt comfortable outing myself to this guy I had no chance of seeing again-or so I thought.

He outed himself as bi to me, and over the next six months, we developed a relationship. Blah-blah-he talked about having BPD and basically admitting that he manipulates women to deal with his mommy issues and that he's just gay.

He dumped me after I spent thousands of dollars on him and convinced him to move back to our hometown, all because he's scared of having to eventually come out. Now, he's dating some vapid girl with all the traits he frequently would complain about in other people. The tension kills me, and my high school best friend is still bemoaning losing him. I don't mind outing myself to her at this point, but should I to tell her he was gay all along?

She won't out him, and it would help us both heal. 

I have a decent chance of getting him back, though. He thinks I don't notice, but I get view notifications on how he stalks me on [Academia.edu](https://Academia.edu) and other sites, and his YouTube history is full of videos about stuff I talked about. I would have to make the next move, though, and I'm just tired.",Asshole
AITA for not making Group B pay for a meme we of Group A who skipped out on his meal?,"My server is pretty pissed at me right now. Two groups came in. We’ll call them group A and group B. Both consist of a male and female respectively. Female A and Female B are friends. Female B offers to pay for Female A’s meal. Group A eats and Male and Female A both leave. The time comes to pay and it comes to my attention that Male A hasn’t paid for his food. My server wants me to make Female B pay for both of Group A. I refuse saying that Female B only offered to pay for Female A and it’s not her responsibility to pay for Male A who walked out. My server gets upset by this and walks to the back while I cash out Group B and let them leave. Waffle House doesn’t have a policy that punishes the servers when someone walks out, so my server isn’t going to face any repercussions and in my opinion Group B shouldn’t be penalized for Male A skipping out on paying. What’s your opinion, did I handle this correctly?

Edit: Messed up the title lol meant to say meal a member of Group A ate

Edit 2: As the night shift manager, I’d also like to reiterate that in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM is my server going to get in trouble for her table walking out. This is in no way her fault, I’m trying to argue here that Male A is the asshole for walking out on his check.",Not the A-hole
AITA foretelling my girlfriend to cover up around my family?,"Some background is that her parents just started to except that I was gay.

Me and my girlfriend wear sweatpants and fuzzy sweaters 98% of the time. But whenever we go to sleep or wake up for coffee in the morning we wear usually just underpants. It doesn't bother me because I'm really comfortable with nudity and it's just her and me in the house so who cares right? It's not like I haven't seen her naked. 

Her parents are staying in town and we are crashing on the couch while they get the master bed. My girlfriend isn't crazy so in the mornings she says that she'll put on a nightgown or pajamas but she is very used to sleeping naked/shirtless. I am very worried that her parents will walk into the living room and see her nude. she has a very hard time sleeping clothed because she's so used to it. 

She asked if it would be okay if she just wear a sports bra and I said ""sure"" I woke up in the middle of the night to get some water and she was completely naked in the morning I lightly and jokingly scolded her ""that's nice pair of boobs, of course you want to show them off to your dad"" 

She got mad. And said that she should be able to sleep however she wants and that she is tired of me telling her to cover up.  She says that it's not even MY parents and none of my business what she wears to sleep.

They are literally going to be in town for 5 days.

AITA for telling my long-term girlfriend did I don't want my my in-laws to see her naked?

Edit: I'm super the antagonist. Me and my girlfriend wrote this up we were giggling at all the responses, a lot of them made me see where she was coming from. I just explained that I don't feel comfortable because I don't want her homophobic parents too think about me seeing her naked/us having sex. She agreed with that make sense and will wear a sports bra. So, we agreed that I'm not the antagonist for asking but that I am the antagonist for poorly communicating. 

Girlfriend here: Hi, just to clarify, the joke about my dad didn't make me uncomfortable. Because I'm their daughter I couldn't imagine them not accepting me. But I can certainly imagine them not accepting my girlfriend. So I think that we act a little less intimate while they were around to get them used to it. thanks!",Asshole
AITA for being upset over friends not making an effort to figure out my birthday when I deny to tell them?,"Throwaway because friends know my actual account.

Some background real quick: In my online circle of friends that I've known for about a few months or so, I have mentioned my birthday in public communities and have it listed on social media. When some friends ask me when it is (through private messaging), I don't usually say and tease them to guess. If they want me to guess when their birthday is, I can almost always figure it out through a bit of searching and guessing.

For my friends, I make birthday gifts for them (artwork). I hate to say it like this but the quality and speed I do them in wouldn't be something that people could get easily for free, even as close friends. Each one takes me hours and since I'm very busy with school, I have to draw during my few short breaks and while commuting which gives me headaches. I also have wrist issues and it makes it even more difficult to push pieces out continuously like this. Obviously, I won't always finish a piece in time but I do my best to work with my deadlines and try to make sure I give them it at least less than one month after. I do not promise that I will make a gift every time a birthday happens.

Now, my friends are very patient with receiving these gifts if I've told them they'll be late. There's one friend that does keep reminding me to work on her gift, which is partially my fault since it's been months since her birthday and I just haven't had the energy or motivation to (burnout?). I did tell her I'd do my best to draw for her.

My birthday passed a few days ago and less than half of the friends I've given gifts to wished me happy birthday. I didn't say anything to them, but it really hurt. The girl that kept ushering me to do her gift didn't mention it either.

I don't expect anything in return for the gifts I make except for a 'thank-you' and at least a 'happy birthday' on my birthday.

So Reddit, did I dig my own hole with this? Should I not be so expectant of friends? I'm honestly leaning towards me being TA because of my unwillingness to outright tell and the fact that they are not entitled to figure it out but I'd like some outside opinions. I haven't told any of them how I felt.

Edit + INFO: Woah I didn't expect to receive responses this quickly, thank you guys for all your comments! I've read through them and it looks like I really need to change my way of thinking about things like these, I've reread my post and like some of you said, it definitely sounds entitled. I'll do my best to improve my personality since it looks like that needs some work as well. Yes, I'm a minor (teenager) and I never really thought about how birthdays were likely less important as people grow older since some of my younger online friends tend to make it a big deal.

Oh and one more thing to add if someone reads this far: If I had not withheld the information and the person knew when my birthday was (wished me hbd last year but not this year), would I be TA? Because that was the situation with one person.

INFO: Some of them know exactly where to find my birthday since they were there when I said it in public and/or know my social media. I assumed that they'd write down the dates (since I do) but now I realize that's not something I should be assuming.",Asshole
AITA for creating an alternate account to interact with someone who blocked me?,"I was talking to an author on Wattpad who wrote one of my favorite fics. He seemed pretty nice and we were getting along, but then I sent a PM that basically said ""While I like your fic, I think you demonise certain characters too much. You demonise any character who doesn't worship your favorite."" Then he blocked me on Wattpad and Tumblr. Maybe I'm mistaken and he blocked me for some other reason, but I can't think of one.

After a while, I created an alternate Wattpad account (I tried a Tumblr one at first, but it didn't work) and PM'ed him requesting to be unblocked and for him to explain why he blocked me, and if it was because of the PM I thought he was being a bit oversensitive. Recently I received an email saying my account was apparently closed for harassment. I could still sign into my original one, but not my alternate one. I assume the author reported me because I literally didn't do anything on that account except PM him.

I feel like I should've let it go, but at the same time I feel like I should've tried interacting with him more on the alternate account. I really did like his fic, I just thought some of his opinions were overboard.",Asshole

AITA For Dropping My Bestfriend For Liking My Brother?,"     So i was best friends with this girl for a little over a year. She would come over all the time. She ended up liking my brother. This girl isn't the type of girl that my brother would like so he never liked her back. They were friends but never anything more. We would all always hangout together because im really close with my brother so we would share friends. She eventually started coming over just to hangout with him. She grew to like him a lot. He still didnt like her. One day they got in an arguement because he didnt like her back. She took her anger out on me but in a few days me and her were still bestfriends. The 4th of July came around and we were having a cookout so my brother was having friends over so of course i invited her. So I texted her asking if she wanted to come over. She told me that she wasnt gonna come over because my brother did not like her back. I will admit, i got mad because she was gonna choose my brothers happiness over mine. We were supposed to be bestfriends after all so i would expect her to choose me, not my brother. So, i continued to tell her that if she was gonna choose my brother over me that we couldnt be bestfriends we could only be friends.

Then she asked if i was single and i said yea but im not looking for dates on the app. So around the end of the conversation i told her i was tired and about to head to bed. She said she was going to bed soon and said she was doing private shows, i just said thats great have fun. She then kept asking me to watch it and she would give me a discount and i kept saying no i dont have the money and im not intrested. She then got mad and said im pathetic and that's when i got mad and told her if i wanted to see naked people of watch porn and said please dont message me anymore.

AITA for dating younger women and refusing to date women my own age (30s)?,"I (32M) swear I saw a similar post to this here, I've been looking for it ever since but can't find it.

I refuse to date women my own age and in their 30s for a similar reason to that post I saw. In my youth (late teens/early 20s) I wasn't very sexually active even though I *wanted* to be, and it did a bit of a number on me. The majority of people my age (girls and guys), had their sexual escapades and are either now settled down (married) or dating (looking for serious relationships). 

They don't have the sexual insecurities that I have, because by and large, they ''had their fun'' so to speak. 

As a result of this, I put a lot of effort into improving my looks and social skills so that I could stand a chance. Now my current girlfriend is 21 years old. My girlfriend before that, was also 21. And the hookups I have had (only had a few really, not many) over the last few years, were with girls in their 20's.

Basically, I just refuse to date a woman my own age, because they are far more experienced than me sexually. They've got a good decade over me. As a result of this, I refuse to date them.

Now I 100% recognize that I've got a lot of life experience over a 20 year old, but if I'm forced to choose between a 20 year old without that much life experience and who hasn't slept around for more than a decade, versus a 30 year old woman who has similar life experience but has had loads of sexual hookups and outnumbers me by far sexually, I'm always going to choose the former.

There's just no way in hell I would ever entertain the idea of dating a woman my own age unless under very specific circumstances. **If I had slept around and had all my fun during my early 20s, THEN I would date women my own age, but because I didn't, I now refuse to even consider dating them. This doesn't mean I hate them though, I'm friends with many women my own age, but I'd never date them.**

Some of my friends don't like the fact that I'm dating a 21 year old, but I think they sort of lose the right to object because it's easy for them to say ''Date a woman your own age'' when they all had their sexual fun, whereas I didn't. Why should they have the right to tell me that? I'd like to see how they would feel under my circumstances. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for making a buddy feel like crap because he didn’t get the job he has wanted his entire life and then some.,"
AITA I don’t think I am in THIS CASE but a buddy of mine recently got turned down for a job he was wanted this entire life. My buddy wanted to get into the financial industry and he finally got a interview with a well respected company. He went to the interview dressed in a suit like your supposed to but failed miserably at something so simple. 

He goes into the interview with a beard and I believed that’s the reason why he didn’t get the job. He has a good resume and was qualified for the job too. When he told me I asked him “ did you go clean shaven” he said no I am not going to do that we are not in the 1960’s. I said well then I don’t  feel bad for you because it’s your ignorance that cost you the job. He said this is not cool I am not feeling to good. Now is not the time to be a di(k like you normally are. I said we have been friends since high school but I would not hire you if I owned my mothers company. He said WTF I said it’s simple you have a beard and tattoos and I don’t care if it’s 2020 I wouldn’t want you working for me. We are both 28 but that does not matter it’s common sense to go to a interview clean shaven.

I write this now because I found out that that was the biggest reason why he didn’t get the job. I don’t care how liberal or conservative you are it looks unprofessional to have tattoos and facial hair.

 A stray cat regularly visited one of the prisoners getting in through a gap in the wall. My great uncle came back one night to find the Nazi happily playing with the cat, giving the animal his food ration and gently as could be tucking it under his blanket while he slept on the hard floor.

The Nazi was an unapologetic monster to the inmates. He had overseen murders numbering in the hundreds of thousands himself. 

But my great uncle was touched by this gentle side and against regulations continued to allow the cat to visit. My great uncle took a photograph of the Nazi and the cat together.

My grand uncle left the photograph to me and I have had it framed recently. Am I a ghoul for this?",Asshole
AITA For Pottytraining My Kid In Front of Ppl?,"TLDR; I let my toddler be naked to toilet train. He shit in the house and my brother and his friends lost their fkn mind. AITA?

I (24F) live on a multi family property w/ my husband (23M) and children (4yr & 18Mo)
We share the property, (owned by our parents) but not the same household as my younger brothers (19M, 17M) and their 2 friends as room mates (19M & 20M)
Me & my kids will frequently come over to my brothers house because they have a fullsized kitchen and that makes cooking meals for my family much easier.
The group of dudes has said they don't mind this although sometimes it feels as tho we ""live here too""
Anyways, flash forward to this weekend and we're starting pottytraining my 18Mo. old... the child removes their diaper whenever its dirty, often before me & my husband even discover they've soiled it and has made several disgusting messes (shit the bed-literally-on more than 1 occasion) so of course we were like fuck this, you don't want a diaper? time to start using the toilet.
We were in my brothers kitchen (hardwood floors, if that matters) and said Child shit. on the floor. as will happen, accident are a part if the process. i pottytrained the eldest child the same way. Sure, its def kinda gross, but you just clean it up thouroughly posthaste and its NBD right?
heeeellllll nah. my brother, who saw it happen, lost his fucking marbles. started screaming at us about why tf our kid wasn't in a diaper or clothed, how nasty this was, stormed out of the room. We calmly explained he was pottytraining, this was normal and just a phase, and wiped it up before the conversation was even finished???
My brother proceeds to tell the other household members who all unanimously agreed that a toddler shitting in the house was just the worst thing that could happen. When I came back later that night they got in this all out yelling match with me & my husband and said they were uncomfortable seeing my kids naked in the first place but then made it all personal by saying we were TRASHY PARENTS and made all these like, weird comparisons like what we were doing was completely unneccessary & unreasonable??? i compromised by saying we would only let the children be naked in our own house or in the yard and they acted like even letting them in the yard was outrageous  and honestly I'm frustrated and offended. My husband got offended and ended up screaming at them and making the whole thing very tense. Anyways, long story short-

AITA just because my kid shit in my brothers(parents) house? Are they maybe the asshole because their response to it was super overblown or unreasonable?

UPDATE: Shortly after posting this one of the roommates texted me and apologized for *his* reaction. He said he asked his parents, grandparents, etc. if that was rlly a phase of pottytraining & they confirmed it was so he wanted to apologize for calling us unreasonable, etc.

Update: Feel like I should clarify because its been mentioned a couple times, we did not BRING the child to the house naked. We came over to make breakfast and he just became naked at some point during the course of me cooking. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Not 100% sure what happened there tbh.",Asshole
AITA for not helping my girl when I was not asked to?,"Hey guys!

So my girl and I been living together for a while but due to Covid she left to help her mom out. I was home alone and working late hours so I didn't clean or do laundry. She had to come once a week and do it. Didn't ask her to but when she saw the mess it had to go.

She popped back over one and saw there was a huge mess so she cleaned it all as a surprise. Then she did the laundry but I had to bring the cart up. I told her it wasn't fair I had to bring the cart up due to my job.

She did laundry again cause she smelled cigerettes and I offered to bring the cart up. It was folded so I took it out neatly and she put it away to clean. While she was cleaning I didn't help because she didn't ask me. She made comments like she was expecting me to but if I am not asked I don't. I rather not be in the way plus I was at work all day. She stays home on unemployment so why not right? I could tell she was upset  but once again she didn't ask for my help. She just thought I would take initiative. She finally asked me to put some clothes in a bag and fold my sweats. I said sure but I didn't get to it right away because I was playing the game.

When she saw I didn't do it she did it herself. I said I was gonna do it just not on her time. I went to take a shower and when I came out I saw the bed was cleared off and she was sitting there. So I gave her a head pat and said good job with a kiss to the forehead. Tbh the place looked great. My laundry bin was empty. She then ate and went to sleep.

Cause I took the cart upstairs my back was hurting and I was stressed so I tried to initiate sexy times. She kinda just laid there so I stopped and went to work. I texted her I was in pain and stressed and she started on about how I didn't help her and her body was hurting as well but I wanted sex? Now I'm mad because she insinuated I'm lazy and just wants sex but she claims she's just saying it isn't fair she had to do that on her own with no help and how can I say my body hurts. I work in a office all day. She just sits home now. Am I really the Asshole here?

EDIT: She is on unemployment and still pays her portion of the bills. I pay the phone bill but she always gives the money back.

She left to help her mother out but I feel like it wasn't to help. It was because I wanted her to clean more and she wouldn't. I also feel like all she did was smoke weed there. I saw photos of the babies but no way she did that.

*Except for one person who changed their mind I'm the asshole here. I can't even begin to figure out where to start to fix the shitpile I caused by posting it here. Thanks to whoever sent a screenshot of this post.*",Asshole
AITA for misspelling my daughter's friend's nickname?,"This happened nearly twenty years ago, but it was recently brought up in conversation with my daughter, and she still seems to think I'm the asshole. Personally, I think there weren't any assholes, but my daughter sure thinks I was.

When my daughter was turning 7, we had a birthday party for her with probably 15 kids in attendance in our little apartment. One of those kids was my daughter's friend from daycare, Jessica, who generally went by Jessie, or sometimes Jess. She wasn't really picky, as long as it got the point across. Jessica was a couple of years younger than my daughter, so probably 5/6.

At the party, we served pop in little solo cups. Since they all looked the same, if a kid wanted a cup, I'd write their name on the cup in sharpie, and that was their cup for the rest of the party. Jessica came up and asked for pop, so I grabbed a cup, wrote ""Jes"" on it, filled it with pop and gave it to her. She looks at the cup, then back at me, and hands it back and says ""it's spelled with two S's"". I was taken aback by this, because, as I said, she responds to basically any iteration of ""Jessica"" that gets thrown her way. I told her that it can be spelled with one S, but she was adamant that it was two S's. At this point there were a couple kids waiting to get pop, so I asked her to sound it out ""J-E-S. Sounds just like Jess, right?"" She didn't really have a response to that, so she sulked away with her cup in hand. I served the other kids, and went off to do other hosting activities.

A few minutes later, I walk back to the kitchen to find Jessica had pulled up a chair to the counter, grabbed the sharpie, and was writing another ""S"" on her (still full of pop) cup. I asked her what she was doing, which startled her. She tipped off the chair, spilling pop on herself and the floor, hurting her elbow on the counter, and leaving a large sharpie mark on the cupboard door.

She was crying at this point, and by the time I had calmed her down and cleaned her up, her parents had arrived to pick her up.

I was never able to get that sharpie mark out of the cupboards, and lost most of my security deposit because of it when we moved a few years later.

TLDR; I misspelled my daughter's friend's nickname and wouldn't fix it. She tried to fix it while i was out of the room and hurt herself.

AITA?

EDIT: Okay, I probably shouldn't have mentioned the deposit thing. I don't blame her or think of her in bad light due to this situation, I just didn't think I was being an asshole. Apparently I was. Next time I see her, I'll let her know.",Asshole
AITA For Enforcing Space Between Son and GF,"My son's [16M] girlfriend [16F] was over. They went into my son's room to cuddle. I could hear through the door that they kept saying ""I love you"" to the other over and over and over again. They were saying it very intensely

I thought it was totally weird how they felt the need to say that to each other so many times in just 20 minutes. 

I concluded that they are co-dependent. Not only do they talk on the phone for like an hour every day, but that incident really proved it to me. 

I have been trying to explain they are too attached. I have been trying to enforce more space between them. Less calling and texting her. Way less seeing her. Etc. But he is getting angry about it.

THEY LITERALLY SAID I LOVE YOU LIKE 30 TIMES IN 20 MINUTES",Asshole
AITA for laughing when my boyfriend told me he wanted to try crossdressing because he sometimes feels like a woman?,"I thought he was joking, I laughed because I thought it was a joke.

However he was serious and now he doesn't want to talk with me, he says I'm an asshole for laughing at him.

I've tried to explain that I thought it was a joke, but he doesn't wants to listen.",Asshole
AITA for talking during LEGO BATMAN at my ex boyfriends house?,"So, basically how it started was I showed up to my ex boyfriends house (let’s call him “Harry”) with my friend “Camilla” around 7pm. We put on a reality tv show we had been watching and he spoke through the whole thing about how stupid it was, however I didn’t really care or take much notice. From his perspective, he was silent through the whole thing, just to be fair. So we will have to agree to disagree.
Then, he decides the next movie to watch is LEGO Batman. Obviously a very small demographic of people besides children and teens would be into this so I wasn’t that into it but let it slide anyway. Five mins into the movie I got an email on my phone (I’m a makeup artist) that I had been offered a really good job with a good photographer and told my friend because I was excited. To be fair, we had been kind of whispering / chatting through the start of the movie. Suddenly Harry SNAPS and starts yelling “SHUT THE F*CK UP! YOU SHOWED UP HERE UNINVITED AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK GO MOVE F*CKING ROOMS!” In terms of “showing up uninvited”, he was my boyfriend at the time and literally everyone showed up uninvited to his house and it had never been an issue. Obviously I was extremely furious at the way he randomly snapped at me over a children’s movie and to this day he still refuses to apologise. So, am I the asshole for talking during LEGO Batman? 
PS: This isn’t a joke, I know it sounds extremely stupid but this actually happened.",Asshole
AITA for returning my wife’s shoes?,"My wife was at the doctor’s office  for our baby’s two week checkup when I stumbled upon new purchases in her closet. 

As in shoes ( flip flops, sandals, etc) that looked pretty close to the ones she had already had in the closet, that she had bought earlier this year in preparation I guess for summer.

Except that the shoes were much bigger than the ones she had previously. 

This is our first baby and to be honest, what I noticed more than anything is the fact that her feet have got swollen. Wider and longer as her pregnancy progressed. 

It has been a big mood killer for me and it’s made worse by the fact that my mom compares pregnancy feet to a loaf of bread and I can only visualize her feet like that.

But more than that, my mom said that feet are supposed to shrink after pregnancy and that weight loss is a big part of it.

So I was upset that my wife just spent all this money on new shoes when she barely goes anywhere outside of either her bedroom or our baby’s room, and should be gunning for weight loss instead of throwing in the towel.

I thought that it was an impulsive purchase that in the end was going to waste money and disincentivize her to lose weight and look for solutions to her swollen feet.

As a result, I ended up taking the shoes back and getting refunds. 

Now my wife is pissed and I feel like she’s just going to refuse to lose weight out of spite. 

AITA? I can’t help feeling not attracted to her, and unfortunately the state of her feet is something I notice very clearly.

And I’m also still mad that she used my money without permission and am tempted to cut up the credit cards she uses if she is going to continue to impulse buy.",Asshole
